TI A critical comment on Braun's ''restricted access in exchange systems''
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In general this comment tackles the problems and difficulties potentially combined with an application of formal economic models and constructs, such as the Walras equilibrium and microeconmic demand theory, to pure sociological contexts. In particular, this is done by analyzing a further attempt, as recently suggested by Braun (1993 and 1994), to extend the well-known Coleman Model by incorporating the embeddedness of social transactions in incomplete social network structures. ''Pars pro toto'' it is proved that Braun's conceptualization contains some weaknesses which imply that fundamental conclusions drawn in his article have to be revised.

TI Is politics power or policy oriented? A comparative analysis of dynamic
   access models in policy networks
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL SOCIOLOGY

DE policy networks; collective decision making; computer simulation;
   object-oriented modeling; dynamic modeling of social networks
AB In policy networks actors use access relations to influence preferences of other actors. Establishment and shifts of access relations and their consequences for outcomes of decisions are the main focal points in this paper. Unlike most policy network studies, we therefore do not take the network and its relations as given and constant. Instead we device computer simulation models to account for the dynamics in policy networks. We compare different models and investigate the resulting network structures and predicted outcomes of decisions. The choice among the alternative models is made by their correspondence with empirical network structures and actual outcomes of decisions.
   In our models, we assume that all relevant actors aim at policy outcomes as close as possible to their own preferences. Policy outcomes are determined by the preferences df the final decision makers at the moment of the vote. In general, only a small fraction of the actors takes part in the final vote. Most actors have therefore to rely on access relations for directly or indirectly shaping the preferences of the final decision makers. For this purpose actors make access requests to other actors. An access relation is assumed to be established if such a request is accepted by the other actor.
   Access relations require time and resources. Actors are therefore assumed to be restricted in the number of access requests they can make and the number of requests they can accept Moreover, due to incomplete information and simultaneous actions by other actors, actors have to make simplifying assumptions in the selection of their ''best'' requests and learn by experience.
   We device two base models that correspond to two basic views on the nature of political processes. In the first view politics is seen as power driven. Corresponding to this view, actors aim at access relations with the most powerful actors in the field. They estimate their likelihood of success by comparing their own resources with those of the target actors. Power also determines the order in which actors accept requests. In the second view, policy matters and actors roughly estimate the effects access relations might have on the outcome of decisions. Actors select requests to ''bolster'' their own preference as much as possible.
   We will show that these base models and some intermediate ones result in fundamentally different network structures and predicted outcomes. Moreover, we will show that the policy driven models do fundamentally better than the power driven models.

ID POWER; CENTRALITY; SYSTEMS
AB This paper advances a theoretical method that uses social exchange theory to explain the structure of social networks. I begin to develop this generic method through a specific application. Reformulating Blau's (1964) model of social exchange to reflect the dynamic nature of interaction and the accompanying potential for opportunistic behavior, I demonstrate how social exchange may be formalized as a repeated game, and how game-theoretic models may be used to predict the stability of particular exchange network structures. The specific application offers some evidence of the fruitfulness of the generic theoretical method, providing an explanation for the strong, reciprocal relationships in the workgroup advice network observed by Blau (1955).

ID SOCIAL-CLASS
AB St. Barthelemy, a small island in the northeastern Caribbean, is populated primarily by descendants of 17th century French settlers, and hosts seven language varieties. To explain the linguistic complexity of the island, this article reconstructs both its social history (using censuses, church records, and land registries) and its economic history, analyzing the effects of economic change on the island's population. The two offshoot communities on St. Thomas provide evidence of social fragmentation related to occupational differences. Functional explanations for St. Earth's linguistic diversity are inadequate; however, the social network theory of Milroy & Milroy 1992 proves useful in explaining the persistence of language differences in this small isolated community.

AB When computer networks link people as well as machines, they become social networks. Such computer-supported social networks (CSSNs) are becoming important bases of virtual communities, computer-supported cooperative work, and telework. Computer-mediated communication such as electronic mail and computerized conferencing is usually text-based and asynchronous. It has limited social presence, and on-line communications are often more uninhibited, creative, and blunt than in-person communication. Nevertheless, CSSNs sustain strong, intermediate, and weak ties that provide information and social support in both specialized and broadly based relationships. CSSNs foster virtual communities that are usually partial and narrowly focused, although some do become encompassing and broadly based. CSSNs accomplish a wide variety of cooperative work, connecting workers within and between organizations who are often physically dispersed. CSSNs also link teleworkers from their homes or remote work centers to main organizational offices. Although many relationships function off-line as well as on-line, CSSNs have developed their own norms and structures. The nature of the medium both constrains and facilitates social control. CSSNs have strong societal implications, fostering situations that combine global connectivity, the fragmentation of solidarities, the de-emphasis of local organizations (in the neighborhood and workplace), and the increased importance of home bases.
