TI The Influence of Network Structural Preference on Link Prediction
SO DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB Link prediction in complex networks predicts the possibility of link generation between two nodes that have not been linked yet in the network, based on known network structure and attributes. It can be applied in various fields, such as friend recommendation in social networks and prediction of protein-protein interaction in biology. However, in the social network, link prediction may raise concerns about privacy and security, because, through link prediction algorithms, criminals can predict the friends of an account user and may even further discover private information such as the address and bank accounts. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a strategy to prevent being identified by link prediction algorithms and protect privacy, utilizing perturbation on network structure at a low cost, including changing and adding edges. This article mainly focuses on the influence of network structural preference perturbation through deletion on link prediction. According to a large number of experiments on the various real networks, edges between large-small degree nodes and medium-medium degree nodes have the most significant impact on the quality of link prediction.

AB Data analytics in granular computing framework is considered for several mining applications, such as in video analysis, bioinformatics and online social networks which have all the characteristics of Big data. The role of granulation, lower approximation and r-f information measure is exhibited. While the lower approximation over a video sequence signifies the object model for unsupervised tracking, it characterizes the probability (relative frequency) of definite regions in ranking miRNAs for normal and cancer classification. For neural learning, the information on definite region is used as the initial knowledge for encoding while generating the networks through evolution. Granules considered are of different sizes and dimensions with fuzzy and crisp boundaries. The tracking method is effective in handling different ambiguous situations, e.g., overlapping objects, newly appeared object(s), multiple objects in different directions and speeds, in unsupervised mode. The ranking algorithm could find only 1% miRNAs to result in significantly higher F-score than the entire set. Fuzzy-rough communities detected over the granular model of social networks are suitable in dealing with overlapping virtual communities in Big data. The knowledge encoding based on fuzzy-rough set provides superior performance than that of rough set. Future directions of research and challenges including the significance of z-numbers in precisiation of granules are stated. The article includes some of the results published elsewhere.

AB Study question While physician relationships (measured through shared patients) are associated with clinical and utilization outcomes, the extent to which this is driven by local or global network characteristics is not well established. The objective of this research is to examine the association between local and global network statistics with total medical spending and utilization. Data source Data used are the 2011 Massachusetts All Payer Claims Database. Study design The association between network statistics and total medical spending and utilization (using standardized prices) is estimated using multivariate regression analysis controlling for patient demographics and health status. Data collection We limit the sample to continuously enrolled commercially insured patients in Massachusetts in 2011. Principal findings Mean patient age was 45 years, and 56.3% of patients were female. 73.4% were covered by a health maintenance organization. Average number of visits was 5.43, with average total medical spending of $4,911 and total medical utilization of $4,252. Spending was lower for patients treated by physicians with higher degree (p<0.001), eigenvector centrality (p<0.001), clustering coefficient (p<0.001), and measures reflecting the normalized degree (p<0.001) and eigenvector centrality (p<0.001) of specialists connected to a patient's PCP. Spending was higher for patients treated by physicians with higher normalized degree, which accounts for physician specialty and patient panel size (p<0.001). Results were similar for utilization outcomes, although magnitudes differed indicating patients may see different priced physicians. Conclusions Generally, higher values of network statistics reflecting local connectivity adjusted for physician characteristics are associated with increased costs and utilization, while higher values of network statistics reflecting global connectivity are associated with decreased costs and utilization. As changes in the financing and delivery system advance through policy changes and healthcare consolidation, future research should examine mechanisms through which this structure impacts outcomes and potential policy responses to determine ways to reduce costs while maintaining quality and coordination of care. What this study adds It is unknown whether local and global measures of physician network connectivity associated with spending and utilization for commercially insured patients? In this social network analysis, we found generally higher values of network statistics reflecting local connectivity are associated with increased costs and utilization, while higher values of network statistics reflecting global connectivity are associated with decreased costs and utilization. Understanding how to influence local and global physician network characteristics may be important for reducing costs while maintaining quality.

TI Exploring the construction and infiltration strategies of social bots in

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

AB Nowadays, millions of people use Online Social Networks (OSNs) like Twitter, Facebook and Sina Microblog, to express opinions on current events. The widespread use of these OSNs has also led to the emergence of social bots. What is more, the existence of social bots is so powerful that some of them can turn into influential users. In this paper, we studied the automated construction technology and infiltration strategies of social bots in Sina Microblog, aiming at building friendly and influential social bots to resist malicious interpretations. Firstly, we studied the critical technology of Sina Microblog data collection, which indicates that the defense mechanism of that is vulnerable. Then, we constructed 96 social bots in Sina Microblog and researched the influence of different infiltration strategies, like different attribute settings and various types of interactions. Finally, our social bots gained 5546 followers in the 42-day infiltration period with a 100% survival rate. The results show that the infiltration strategies we proposed are effective and can help social bots escape detection of Sina Microblog defense mechanism as well. The study in this paper sounds an alarm for Sina Microblog defense mechanism and provides a valuable reference for social bots detection.

ID SPREADING MODEL; TRANSMISSION
AB We propose to model the phenomenon of the spread of a rumor in social networks in this paper. From an existingSIRmodel, we manipulate a new one that is based on the model of cholera in order to take into account professional pages that specialize in spreading rumors. In the second part, we introduce a control strategy to fight against the diffusion of the rumor. Our main objective is to characterize the three optimal controls that minimize the number of spreader users, fake pages, and the corresponding costs. For that matter, using the maximum principle of Pontryagin, we prove the existence and we give characterization of our controls. Numerical simulations are given to concretize our approach.
