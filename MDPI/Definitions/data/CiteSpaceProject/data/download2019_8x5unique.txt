AB Background
   As population health and well-being are influenced by multiple factors that cut across sectoral boundaries, an intersectoral approach that acknowledges and leverages the multiple determinants, actors and sectors at play is increasingly seen as critical for achieving meaningful and lasting improvements. In this study, we utilize social network analysis (SNA) to characterize the intersectoral collaboration between the organizations working on maternal & child health (MCH) and water & sanitation (WASH) before and immediately after the implementation of HCL Foundation (HCLF)-funded HCL Samuday Project (2015-2017) in a rural block of Uttar Pradesh state, India. While SNA has been used to examine public health issues, few have used it monitor stakeholder relationships, intervene, improve and facilitate project implementation involving intersectoral partnerships, particularly in the context of a low-and middle-income countries.
   Method
   An organization-level SNA was conducted with 31 key informants from 24 organizations working on MCH and/or WASH in Kachhauna, Uttar Pradesh, India. Data were collected using face-to-face, semi-structured interviews between June and September 2017. Density, centrality and homophily were calculated to describe the network and a qualitative analysis was also conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of collaboration between organizations working on MCH and WASH.
   Results
   Overall, our findings showed that the network of organizations working on MCH and WASH in Kachhauna grew in number since the implementation of Samuday. HCLF rapidly achieved centrality, thus positioning the organization to serve as a gatekeeper of information and enabling it to play a coordinator role within the network. Direct collaboration between other organizations working on MCH and WASH was low at both time points. Interviews with key informants indicated widespread interest in increasing interorganizational interactions and engagement throughout the network.
   Conclusion
   This study demonstrates the feasibility and practical application of SNA for projects like Samuday that involve intersectoral collaboration. It also provides lessons about the use of SNA with organizations as the unit of analysis and in the context of rural India, including challenges, practical considerations, and limitations.

TI Network Embedding-Aware Point-of-Interest Recommendation in
   Location-Based Social Networks
SO COMPLEXITY
LA English
DT Article
AB As one of the important techniques to explore unknown places for users, the methods that are proposed for point-of-interest (POI) recommendation have been widely studied in recent years. Compared with traditional recommendation problems, POI recommendations are suffering from more challenges, such as the cold-start and one-class collaborative filtering problems. Many existing studies have focused on how to overcome these challenges by exploiting different types of contexts (e.g., social and geographical information). However, most of these methods only model these contexts as regularization terms, and the deep information hidden in the network structure has not been fully exploited. On the other hand, neural network-based embedding methods have shown its power in many recommendation tasks with its ability to extract high-level representations from raw data. According to the above observations, to well utilize the network information, a neural network-based embedding method (node2vec) is first exploited to learn the user and POI representations from a social network and a predefined location network, respectively. To deal with the implicit feedback, a pair-wise ranking-based method is then introduced. Finally, by regarding the pretrained network representations as the priors of the latent feature factors, an embedding-based POI recommendation method is proposed. As this method consists of an embedding model and a collaborative filtering model, when the training data are absent, the predictions will mainly be generated by the extracted embeddings. In other cases, this method will learn the user and POI factors from these two components. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the importance of the network embeddings and the effectiveness of our proposed method.

AB This paper constructs a new theory of social networks based on reputation. The model assumes that reputation is an asset and that individuals connect by buying options on the reputation of others. In networking, individuals construct portfolios of call options to leverage the reputations of others and put options to hedge the connections with others. A network then consists of portfolios of reputation options. The option model confers advantages not present in existing models. First, the payoff to connecting is the payoff on a portfolio of reputation options. Second, the network forms as individuals take option positions; the network evolves as individuals adjust those positions. Third, networking strategies become option strategies. The model allows for insights into network structure, the price of connecting and the value of connecting.

AB Quantifying the nodal spreading abilities and identifying the potential influential spreaders has been one of the most engaging topics recently, which is essential and beneficial to facilitate information flow and ensure the stabilization operations of social networks. However, most of the existing algorithms just consider a fundamental quantification through combining a certain attribute of the nodes to measure the nodes' importance. Moreover, reaching a balance between the accuracy and the simplicity of these algorithms is difficult. In order to accurately identify the potential super-spreaders, the CumulativeRank algorithm is proposed in the present study. This algorithm combines the local and global performances of nodes for measuring the nodal spreading abilities. In local performances, the proposed algorithm considers both the direct influence from the node's neighbourhoods and the indirect influence from the nearest and the next nearest neighbours. On the other hand, in the global performances, the concept of the tenacity is introduced to assess the node's prominent position in maintaining the network connectivity. Extensive experiments carried out with the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model on real-world social networks demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the comparison of the proposed algorithm with the existing well-known algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm has lower time complexity and can be applicable to large-scale networks.

AB Modeling human behavioral data is challenging due to its scale, sparseness (few observations per individual), heterogeneity (differently behaving individuals), and class imbalance (few observations of the outcome of interest). An additional challenge is learning an interpretable model that not only accurately predicts outcomes, but also identifies important factors associated with a given behavior. To address these challenges, we describe a statistical approach to modeling behavioral data called the structured sum-of-squares decomposition (S3D). The algorithm, which is inspired by decision trees, selects important features that collectively explain the variation of the outcome, quantifies correlations between the features, and bins the subspace of important features into smaller, more homogeneous blocks that correspond to similarly-behaving subgroups within the population. This partitioned subspace allows us to predict and analyze the behavior of the outcome variable both statistically and visually, giving a medium to examine the effect of various features and to create explainable predictions. We apply S3D to learn models of online activity from large-scale data collected from diverse sites, such as Stack Exchange, Khan Academy, Twitter, Duolingo, and Digg. We show that S3D creates parsimonious models that can predict outcomes in the held-out data at levels comparable to state-of-the-art approaches, but in addition, produces interpretable models that provide insights into behaviors. This is important for informing strategies aimed at changing behavior, designing social systems, but also for explaining predictions, a critical step towards minimizing algorithmic bias.
