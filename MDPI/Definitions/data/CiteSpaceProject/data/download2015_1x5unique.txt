TI Online Social Snapshots of a Generic Facebook Session Based on Digital
   Insight Data for a Secure Future IT Environment
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL

DT Article
AB Physical memory acquisition has been an import facet for digital forensics (DF) specialists due to its volatile characteristics. Nowadays, thousands of millions of global participants utilize online social networking (OSN) mechanisms to expand their social lives, ranging from business-oriented purposes to leisure motivations. Facebook (FB) is one of the most dominant social networking sites (SNS) available today. Unfortunately, it has been a major avenue for cybercriminals to commit illegal activities. Therefore, the digital traces of previous sessions of an FB user play an essential role as the first step for DF experts to pursue the disclosure of the identity of the suspect who was exploiting FB. In this research work, we provide a systematic methodology to reveal a previous session of an FB identity, as well as his/her partial social circle via collecting, analyzing, preserving and presenting the associated digital traces to obtain the online social snapshots of a specific FB user who was utilizing a computing device with Internet Explorer (IE) 10 without turning off the power of the gadget. This novel approach can be a paradigm for how DF specialists ponder the crime scene to conduct the first response in order to avoid the permanent loss of the precious digital evidence in previous FB sessions. The hash values of the image files of the random access memory (RAM) of the computing device have proven to be identical before and after forensics operations, which could be probative evidence in a court of law.

TI Tail-scope: Using friends to estimate heavy tails of degree
   distributions in large-scale complex networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL NETWORK; SPREAD
AB Many complex networks in natural and social phenomena have often been characterized by heavy-tailed degree distributions. However, due to rapidly growing size of network data and concerns on privacy issues about using these data, it becomes more difficult to analyze complete data sets. Thus, it is crucial to devise effective and efficient estimation methods for heavy tails of degree distributions in large-scale networks only using local information of a small fraction of sampled nodes. Here we propose a tail-scope method based on local observational bias of the friendship paradox. We show that the tail-scope method outperforms the uniform node sampling for estimating heavy tails of degree distributions, while the opposite tendency is observed in the range of small degrees. In order to take advantages of both sampling methods, we devise the hybrid method that successfully recovers the whole range of degree distributions. Our tail-scope method shows how structural heterogeneities of large-scale complex networks can be used to effectively reveal the network structure only with limited local information.

ID PERFORMANCE; CENTRALITY
AB Social capital theory assumes that information is valuable. However, only rarely is this value explicitly modeled, and there are few examples of empirical tests of mechanisms that connect social network structure to valuable information. We model an individual decision problem in which individuals make choices that yield uncertain outcomes. The individuals can learn about the profitability of options from their own choices and from the network. We generate computer-simulated data to derive hypotheses about the effect of network characteristics on making profitable choices. We conduct a laboratory experiment to empirically test these hypotheses and find that, at the individual level, degree centrality has a positive effect on making profitable choices whereas betweenness centrality has no effect. At the network level, density has a positive effect on making profitable choices, whereas centralization does not have an effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Inferring Social Status and Rich Club Effects in Enterprise
   Communication Networks
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Social status, defined as the relative rank or position that an individual holds in a social hierarchy, is known to be among the most important motivating forces in social behaviors. In this paper, we consider the notion of status from the perspective of a position or title held by a person in an enterprise. We study the intersection of social status and social networks in an enterprise. We study whether enterprise communication logs can help reveal how social interactions and individual status manifest themselves in social networks. To that end, we use two enterprise datasets with three communication channels-voice call, short message, and email-to demonstrate the social-behavioral differences among individuals with different status. We have several interesting findings and based on these findings we also develop a model to predict social status. On the individual level, high-status individuals are more likely to be spanned as structural holes by linking to people in parts of the enterprise networks that are otherwise not well connected to one another. On the community level, the principle of homophily, social balance and clique theory generally indicate a "rich club" maintained by high-status individuals, in the sense that this community is much more connected, balanced and dense. Our model can predict social status of individuals with 93% accuracy.

AB Individuals' access to social information can depend on their social network. Homophily-a preference to associate with similar phenotypes-may cause assortment within social networks that could preclude information transfer from individuals who generate information to those who would benefit from acquiring it. Thus, understanding phenotypic assortment may lead to a greater understanding of the factors that could limit the transfer of information between individuals. We tested whether there was assortment in wild baboon (Papio ursinus) networks, using data collected from two troops over 6 years for six phenotypic traits-boldness, age, dominance rank, sex and the propensity to generate/exploit information-using two methods for defining a connection between individuals-time spent in proximity and grooming. Our analysis indicated that assortment was more common in grooming than proximity networks. In general, there was homophily for boldness, age, rank and the propensity to both generate and exploit information, but heterophily for sex. However, there was considerable variability both between troops and years. The patterns of homophily we observed for these phenotypes may impede information transfer between them. However, the inconsistency in the strength of assortment between troops and years suggests that the limitations to information flow may be quite variable.
