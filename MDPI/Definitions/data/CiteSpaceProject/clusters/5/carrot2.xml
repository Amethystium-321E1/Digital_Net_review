<title>China's non-ferrous metal recycling technology convergence and driving factors: A quadratic assignment procedure analysis based on patent collaboration-based network structural hole</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0271694</url>
<snippet>Technological convergence is an important organizational innovation capability, essential for improving the core competitiveness of green and sustainable industries. However, studies have mainly focused on measuring technological convergence and have ignored the factors that affect the capabilities of such convergence capabilities. Thus, this study attempts to bridge this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of the impact of structural holes in inter-organizational technical cooperation networks. This technological convergence is studied from the perspective of a patent. It also considers the moderating effects of the degree of patent cooperation and the cooperation distance. It employs the social network theory to construct inter-organizational patent cooperation, and technological convergence networks, to facilitate the analysis of the effect of structural holes on such a convergence. It empirically examines 52 non-ferrous metal recycling organizations, with close patent cooperation. Accordingly, the structural hole constraint index by the inter-organizational patent cooperation network, shows a positive U-shaped curve relationship with technology convergence. Moreover, the degree of inter-organizational patent cooperation strengthens the positive U-shaped relationship, and the distance of cooperation weakens the influence of the structural hole constraint index on technology convergence. Therefore, managers and policymakers should encourage more industry-academia-research or patent alliances and designate policies to promote such cooperation.

<title>Hyper-elite network building in Madagascar: amplification or compensatory strategy?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwac045</url>
<snippet>Research has proved that social networks are unevenly distributed. Qualitative and theoretical work on elite networks raises the question: do they amplify or compensate for inequalities in the powerful other resources? We test these hypotheses using a unique dataset of hyper-elites in Madagascar. We identify three network dimensions: extent, quality and effectiveness. We find that elite groups disadvantaged in terms of social position are generally disadvantaged in terms of social networks. In particular, the caste system is still key to network building at the top. Homophily is the dominant bonding dynamic among elites. However, some compensatory mechanisms are in play. Socially disadvantaged elites tend to make more use of their networks. They also have more upwardly heterophilous potential and mobilized networks. The predominance of the elite network's amplifying role explains the prevalence of the elite reproduction dynamic. Newcomers, who represent a minority, are excluded from the highest decision-making bodies.

<title>Learning Dynamics in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA18659</url>
<snippet>This paper proposes a tractable model of Bayesian learning on large random networks where agents choose whether to adopt an innovation. We study the impact of the network structure on learning dynamics and product diffusion. In directed networks, all direct and indirect links contribute to agents' learning. In comparison, learning and welfare are lower in undirected networks and networks with cliques. In a rich class of networks, behavior is described by a small number of differential equations, making the model useful for empirical work.

<title>Interpreting change as controllable: The role of network centrality and self-efficacy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0018726712441642</url>
<snippet>Interpreting organizational change initiatives as controllable can mean the difference between achieving positive or negative outcomes. However, little is known about the factors that underpin such interpretations. This study examines how interpretations of controllability are influenced by individual centrality in social networks and change-related self-efficacy. Drawing on a sample of 148 US public school teachers facing a significant organizational transformation, our analysis reveals that change-related self-efficacy fully mediates relationships between centrality within instrumental and expressive organizational social networks and individual interpretations of change controllability. Network centrality, and the associated access to information and social support that accompany it, are theorized to provide the confidence necessary to interpret change as within one's control. Drawing upon social network theory, we provide insights into how change is interpreted as controllable, and how the nature of change may dictate which types of centrality are most important for such interpretations. Implications for the broader understanding of change are also discussed.

<title>Postmortem Analysis of Decayed Online Social Communities: Cascade Pattern Analysis and Prediction</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/3873601</url>
<snippet>Recently, many online social networks, such as MySpace, Orkut, and Friendster, have faced inactivity decay of their members, which contributed to the collapse of these networks. The reasons, mechanics, and prevention mechanisms of such inactivity decay are not fully understood. In this work, we analyze decayed and alive subwebsites from the Stack Exchange platform. The analysis mainly focuses on the inactivity cascades that occur among the members of these communities. We provide measures to understand the decay process and statistical analysis to extract the patterns that accompany the inactivity decay. Additionally, we predict cascade size and cascade virality using machine learning. The results of this work include a statistically significant difference of the decay patterns between the decayed and the alive subwebsites. These patterns are mainly cascade size, cascade virality, cascade duration, and cascade similarity. Additionally, the contributed prediction framework showed satisfactorily prediction results compared to a baseline predictor. Supported by empirical evidence, the main findings of this work are (1) there are significantly different decay patterns in the alive and the decayed subwebsites of the Stack Exchange; (2) the cascade's node degrees contribute more to the decay process than the cascade's virality, which indicates that the expert members of the Stack Exchange subwebsites were mainly responsible for the activity or inactivity of the Stack Exchange subwebsites; (3) the Statistics subwebsite is going through decay dynamics that may lead to it becoming fully-decayed; (4) the decay process is not governed by only one network measure, it is better described using multiple measures; (5) decayed subwebsites were originally less resilient to inactivity decay, unlike the alive subwebsites; and (6) network's structure in the early stages of its evolution dictates the activity/inactivity characteristics of the network.

<title>Social network analysis and the implications for Pontocaspian biodiversity conservation in Romania and Ukraine: A comparative study</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0221833</url>
<snippet>Romania and Ukraine share the Black Sea coastline, the Danube Delta and associated habitats, which harbor the endemic, aquatic Pontocaspian biota. Currently, this biota is diminishing both in numbers of species and their abundance because of human activities, and its future persistence strongly depends on the adequacy of conservation measures. Romania and Ukraine have a common responsibility to address the conservation of Pontocaspian biodiversity. The two countries, however have different socio-political and legal conservation frameworks, which may result in differences in the social network structure of stakeholder institutions with different implications for Pontocaspian biodiversity conservation. Here, we study the social network structure of stakeholder organizations involved in conservation of Pontocaspian biodiversity in Romania and the implications of network structure for conservation outcomes. Then we compare the findings from Romania to an earlier similar study from Ukraine. We apply a mix of qualitative and quantitative social network analysis methods to combine the content and context of the interactions with relational measures. We show that Pontocaspian biodiversity plays a minor and mostly incidental role in the inter-organizational interactions in Romania. Furthermore, there is room for improvement in the network structure through e.g. more involvement of governmental and nongovernmental organizations and increased motivation of central stakeholders to initiate conservation actions. Social variables, such as lack of funding, hierarchical, non-inclusive system of conservation governance and continuous institutional reforms in the public sector are consequential for the network relations and structure. Social network of stakeholders in Ukraine is more connected and central stakeholders utilize their favorable positions. However, neither in Ukraine is the Pontocaspian biodiversity a driver of organizational interactions. Consequently, both networks translate into sub-optimal conservation actions and the roads to optimal conservation are different. We end with sketching out conservation implications and recommendations for improved national and cross-border conservation efforts.

<title>Misinformation on social platforms: A review and research Agenda</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102654</url>
<snippet>Social platforms contribute to various hedonic and informational needs of their users. However, the unregulated, ubiquitous, and unhindered nature of the platforms is intricately linked to the exponential rise of online misinformation. The complexities in governing misinformation, coupled with the growing distrust of users, have diminished its value proposition for all stakeholders. Hence, it is crucial for all stakeholders to examine the state of research in this domain. We aim to examine the core value-adding governance mechanisms through a systematic scoping literature review. We propose an overarching conceptual framework that integrates the drivers of governance mechanisms with the outcomes of effective misinformation governance. Additionally, the framework illustrates the moderation role of platform monitoring efficiency for effective governance. This study will be especially useful for platform designers and practitioners to identify avenues for introducing strategic interventions on their platform and for scholars to develop a holistic understanding of the overall knowledge base in this domain and thus identify existing gaps in the literature which are rich for future examination.

<title>Emergence of segregation in evolving social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1014486108</url>
<snippet>In many social networks, there is a high correlation between the similarity of actors and the existence of relationships between them. This paper introduces a model of network evolution where actors are assumed to have a small aversion from being connected to others who are dissimilar to themselves, and yet no actor strictly prefers a segregated network. This model is motivated by Schelling's [Schelling TC (1969) Models of segregation. Am Econ Rev 59: 488-493] classic model of residential segregation, and we show that Schelling's results also apply to the structure of networks; namely, segregated networks always emerge regardless of the level of aversion. In addition, we prove analytically that attribute similarity among connected network actors always reaches a stationary distribution, and this distribution is independent of network topology and the level of aversion bias. This research provides a basis for more complex models of social interaction that are driven in part by the underlying attributes of network actors and helps advance our understanding of why dysfunctional social network structures may emerge.

<title>Social network analysis of a landscape-scale conservation initiative in South Africa</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/sajs.2022/11703</url>
<snippet>Assessment of social relations, including social network analysis, is central to understanding collaborative processes for environmental decision-making and action. The capacity of network role players to learn and adapt appropriately to uncertainty and change is a critical determinant of the resilience of social-ecological systems. Poor social network structure can predispose failure. In this study, we used social network analysis to explore learning capacity and network resilience in a multi-authority conservation initiative on the West Coast of South Africa (Dassenberg Coastal Catchment Partnership). Our analysis focused on structural variables for network learning and resilience, namely connectivity, heterogeneity, and centrality. The governance network was found to be structurally connected, with the interaction between heterogeneous organisations and sectors, and centralised around a core group of actors. The network had good structural features to enable learning. However, the high level of centrality, and dependence on a small number of core actors, rendered the network potentially vulnerable to dealing with complex challenges. We recommend that core actors (1) reflect on their core functions and whether the network can absorb these functions if they were to leave and (2) tap into the knowledge potential of actors on the network periphery or invite new actors to the network when dealing with complex challenges. This may require the network to diverge into decentralised subgroups to deal with complex issues. We further suggest that the Dassenberg Coastal Catchment Partnership network incorporate social network research with qualitative monitoring into a long-term plan to monitor the movement and influence of actors as the initiative evolves. Significance: This study illustrates how social network analysis can help researchers, public-sector organisations, and donor agencies to monitor the structural features of governance networks that enable or disable learning and resilience within landscape-scale conservation initiatives. Our results illustrate how social network analysis can assist public-sector actors to reflect on their roles and whether there is redundant competency within the network to maintain its resilience.

<title>Psychological inoculation can reduce susceptibility to misinformation in large rational agent networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211953</url>
<snippet>The unchecked spread of misinformation is recognized as an increasing threat to public, scientific and democratic health. Online networks are a contributing cause of this spread, with echo chambers and polarization indicative of the interplay between the search behaviours of users and reinforcement processes within the system they inhabit. Recent empirical work has focused on interventions aimed at inoculating people against misinformation, yielding success on the individual level. However, given the evolving, dynamic information context of online networks, important questions remain regarding how such inoculation interventions interact with network systems. Here we use an agent-based model of a social network populated with belief-updating users. We find that although equally rational agents may be assisted by inoculation interventions to reject misinformation, even among such agents, intervention efficacy is temporally sensitive. We find that as beliefs disseminate, users form self-reinforcing echo chambers, leading to belief consolidation-irrespective of their veracity. Interrupting this process requires 'front-loading' of inoculation interventions by targeting critical thresholds of network users before consolidation occurs. We further demonstrate the value of harnessing tipping point dynamics for herd immunity effects, and note that inoculation processes do not necessarily lead to increased rates of 'false-positive' rejections of truthful communications.

<title>Entrepreneurial gain, cultural similarity and transnational entrepreneurship</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/glob.12020</url>
<snippet>The aim of this article is to analyse the factors affecting the motivations of immigrant entrepreneurs to generate an entrepreneurial gain (positive impact on home and host countries). We consider that positive reasons for emigrating can increase transnational entrepreneurship and mutual benefits for both societies. To test this hypothesis we present a model using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). This model explains the relations between motivations, cultural similarities, institutions and transnational linkage potentials. We designed an ad hoc search of Argentinean entrepreneurs established in Spain, both as EU citizens and without legal EU status, using online social networks. We applied an online questionnaire to 214 such entrepreneurs. We conclude that institutional rules (formal and informal) greatly influence the location decisions of firms and immigrant entrepreneurs' motivations for starting transnational business because they provide the frame for the development of profitable opportunities.

<title>Explaining Attitude-Consistent Exposure on Social Network Sites: The Role of Ideology, Political Involvement, and Network Characteristics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393211056224</url>
<snippet>There are rising concerns that social network sites (SNS) facilitate the creation of echo chambers, in which attitude-consistent information becomes the norm while attitude-challenging information is avoided. This study aims to investigate theoretically derived predictors of attitude-consistent and attitude-challenging exposure on SNS. We theorize that three key sets of predictors may influence attitude-consistent and attitude-challenging exposure: ideology, cognitive, and behavioral indicators of political involvement, and network characteristics. In a two-wave panel study, we predict the frequency of attitude-consistent and attitude-challenging exposure as well as relative attitude-consistent exposure, measured as attitude-consistent exposure as a share of overall opinion exposure. The results demonstrate that extreme ideological positions, higher political knowledge, and low-effort political participation predicted an increase in (relative) attitude-consistent exposure. Cross-social class exposure predicted a decrease in (relative) attitude-consistent exposure. The findings challenge existing arguments that SNS may per se facilitate attitude-consistent exposure.

<title>Micro-Macro Mediation Analysis in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00811750231220950</url>
<snippet>Mediation analysis is increasingly used in the social sciences. Extension to social network data, however, has proved difficult because statistical network models are formulated at a lower level of analysis (the dyad) than many outcomes of interest. This study introduces a general approach for micro-macro mediation analysis in social networks. The author defines the average mediated micro effect (AMME) as the indirect effect of a network selection process on an individual, group, or organizational outcome through its effect on an intervening network variable. The author shows that the AMME can be nonparametrically identified using a wide range of common statistical network and regression modeling strategies under the assumption of conditional independence among multiple mediators. Nonparametric and parametric algorithms are introduced to generically estimate the AMME in a multitude of research designs. The author illustrates the utility of the method with an applied example using cross-sectional National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health data to examine the friendship selection mechanisms that indirectly shape adolescent school performance through their effect on network structure.

<title>Alternative estimation methods for identifying contagion effects in dynamic social networks: A latent-space adjusted approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.01.002</url>
<snippet>Contagion effects, also known as peer effects or social influence process, have become more and more central to social science, especially with the availability of longitudinal social network data. However, contagion effects are usually difficult to identify, as they are often entangled with other factors, such as homophily in the selection process, the individual's preference for the same social settings, etc. Methods currently available either do not solve these problems or require strong assumptions. Following Shalizi and Thomas (2011), I frame this difficulty as an omitted variable bias problem, and I propose several alternative estimation methods that have potentials to correctly identify contagion effects when there is an unobserved trait that co-determines the influence and the selection. The Monte-Carlo simulation results suggest that a latent-space adjusted estimator is especially promising. It outperforms other estimators that are traditionally used to deal with the unobserved variables, including a structural equation based estimator and an instrumental variable estimator.

<title>"It's like these CHCs don't exist, are they featured anywhere?": Social network analysis of community health committees in a rural and urban setting in Kenya</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220836</url>
<snippet>Background In Kenya, Community Health Committees (CHC) were established to enhance community participation in health services. Their role is to provide leadership, oversight in delivery of community health services, promote social accountability and mobilize resources for community health. CHCs form social networks with other actors, with whom they exchange health information for decision-making and accountability. This case study aimed to explore the structure of a rural and an urban CHC network and to analyze how health-related information flowed in these networks. Understanding the pathways of information in community settings may provide recommendations for strategies to improve the role and functioning of CHCs. Methods In 2017, we conducted 4 focus group discussions with 27 community discussants and 10 semi-structured interviews with health professionals in a rural area and an urban slum. Using social network analysis, we determined the structure of their social networks and how health related information flowed in these networks. Results Both CHCs were composed of respected persons nominated by their communities. Each social network had 12 actors that represented both community and government institutions. CHCs were not central actors in the exchange of health-related information. Health workers, community health volunteers and local Chiefs in the urban slum often passed information between the different groups of actors, while CHCs hardly did this. Therefore, CHCs had little control over the flow of health-related information. Although CHC members were respected persons who served in multiple roles within their communities, this did not enhance their centrality. It emerged that CHCs were often left out in the flow of health-related information and decision-making, which led to demotivation. Community health volunteers were more involved by other actors such as health managers and non-governmental organizations as a conduit for health-related information. Conclusion Social network analysis demonstrated how CHCs played a peripheral role in the flow of health-related information. Their perception of being left out of the information flow led to demotivation, which hampered their ability to facilitate community participation in community health services; hence challenging effective participation through CHCs.

<title>Patent citation network analysis: A perspective from descriptive statistics and ERGMs</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241797</url>
<snippet>Patent Citation Analysis has been gaining considerable traction over the past few decades. In this paper, we collect extensive information on patents and citations and provide a perspective of citation network analysis of patents from a statistical viewpoint. We identify and analyze the most cited patents, the most innovative and the highly cited companies along with the structural properties of the network by providing in-depth descriptive analysis. Furthermore, we employ Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to analyze the citation networks. ERGMs enables understanding the social perspectives of a patent citation network which has not been studied earlier. We demonstrate that social properties such as homophily (the inclination to cite patents from the same country or in the same language) and transitivity (the inclination to cite references' references) together with the technicalities of the patents (e.g., language, categories), has a significant effect on citations. We also provide an in-depth analysis of citations for sectors in patents and how it is affected by the size of the same. Overall, our paper delves into European patents with the aim of providing new insights and serves as an account for fitting ERGMs on large networks and analyzing them. ERGMs help us model network mechanisms directly, instead of acting as a proxy for unspecified dependence and relationships among the observations.

<title>Game theoretical inference of human behavior in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13148-8</url>
<snippet>Social networks emerge as a result of actors' linking decisions. We propose a game-theoretical model of socio-strategic network formation on directed weighted graphs, in which every actors' benefit is a parametric trade-off between centrality measure, brokerage opportunities, clustering coefficient, and sociological network patterns. We use two different stability definitions to infer individual behavior of homogeneous, rational agents from network structure, and to quantify the impact of cooperation. Our theoretical analysis confirms results known for specific network motifs studied previously in isolation, yet enables us to precisely quantify the trade-offs in the space of user preferences. To deal with complex networks of heterogeneous and irrational actors, we construct a statistical behavior estimation method using Nash equilibrium conditions. We provide evidence that our results are consistent with empirical, historical, and sociological observations on real-world data-sets. Furthermore, our method offers sociological and strategic interpretations of random networks models, such as preferential attachment and small-world networks.

The firm can seed the product to a subset of the population and our goal is to find which the optimal subset to target is. We provide a condition that characterizes the optimal targeting strategy for any network structure. The key parameter in this condition is the agents' decay centrality, which takes into account how close an agent is to others, in a way that distant agents are weighted less than closer ones.

<snippet>This is a review of argument and evidence on the connection between social networks and social capital. My summary points are three: (1) Research and theory will better cumulate across studies if we focus an the network mechanisms responsible for social capital effects rather than trying to integrate across metaphors of social capital loosely tied to distant empirical indicators. (2) There is an impressive diversity of empirical evidence showing that social capital is more a function of brokerage across structural holes than closure within a network, bur there are contingency factors. (3) The two leading network mechanisms can be brought together in a productive way within a more general model of social capital. Structural holes are the source of value added, but network closure can be essential to realizing the value buried in the holes.

<title>An anatomical comparison of fake-news and trusted-news sharing pattern on Twitter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-019-09305-5</url>
<snippet>Online social networks allow users to share a variety of multi-media content on the World Wide Web. The rising popularity of such social networking platforms coupled with limitations in verifying the veracity of shared content has contributed to increase in misinformation on these media. Misinformation content such as fake-news and hoaxes, though often considered innocuous, may have high social cost such as influencing elections decision, and thus should be investigated carefully. Many researchers have studied various aspects of fake-news including automated ways to recognize it. However, a large-scale study comparing the sharing patterns of fake-news and trusted-news is missing. In this research, we take Ukraine, a country where fake news is common, as a case study. Using datasets generated by three different Tweets collection strategies, we present an anatomical comparison of fake-news and trusted-news sharing pattern on Twitter. Such a comparison enables to identify the characteristics of tweets sharing fake-news, and allows to find the users who are more inclined to share misinformation. Besides, we also study possible bot activities in the dataset. The top conclusions derived from this study are (a) Users sharing fake-news stories are more likely to include hashtags, and the hashtags used in Tweets sharing fake-news stories are similar to hashtags used in Tweets sharing trusted news. (b) Users sharing fake-news are also more likely to include mentions, but mentions used in tweets sharing fake-news and trusted-news are often different.

<snippet>In this paper we revisit the concept of brokerage in social networks. We elaborate on the concept of brokerage as a process, identifying three distinct classes of brokerage behavior. Based on this process model, we develop a framework for measuring brokerage opportunities in dynamic relational data. Using data on emergent inter-organizational collaborations, we employ the dynamic brokerage framework to examine the relationship between organizational attributes and coordination in the evolving network.

<title>Benchmarking seeding strategies for spreading processes in social networks: an interplay between influencers, topologies and sizes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-60239-4</url>
<snippet>The explosion of network science has permitted an understanding of how the structure of social networks affects the dynamics of social contagion. In community-based interventions with spill-over effects, identifying influential spreaders may be harnessed to increase the spreading efficiency of social contagion, in terms of time needed to spread all the largest connected component of the network. Several strategies have been proved to be efficient using only data and simulation-based models in specific network topologies without a consensus of an overall result. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to benchmark the spreading efficiency of seeding strategies related to network structural properties and sizes. We simulate spreading processes on empirical and simulated social networks within a wide range of densities, clustering coefficients, and sizes. We also propose three new decentralized seeding strategies that are structurally different from well-known strategies: community hubs, ambassadors, and random hubs. We observe that the efficiency ranking of strategies varies with the network structure. In general, for sparse networks with community structure, decentralized influencers are suitable for increasing the spreading efficiency. By contrast, when the networks are denser, centralized influencers outperform. These results provide a framework for selecting efficient strategies according to different contexts in which social networks emerge.

<title>Analyzing the factors that influence the seeking and sharing of information on the smart city digital platform: Empirical evidence from Indonesia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.101876</url>
<snippet>Smart city initiatives are considered as the solutions for urban problems. One dimension of a smart city, i.e., smart people/society, suggests that a smart city requires high-quality social interactions and social relationships that help cities connect with their residents and the outside world. For this purpose, smart cities in Indonesia have developed digital platforms (internet websites and mobile applications) to disseminate the cities' programs and information and facilitate sharing of information among its residents. This study aimed to investigate the factors that affect the seeking and sharing of information on the smart city digital platforms. We used a quantitative approach by conducting surveys in 8 smart cities in Indonesia, with 1161 respondents. The survey data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that social factors (sense of belonging and seeking reputations) have dominant roles in determining residents' intention to seek information on smart city platforms. In turn, the intention to seek information is the key factor that affects the residents' intention to share information on the smart city platforms and on their online social network. This paper provides insights on the factors that need more attention from smart city administrators to improve resident engagement and enhance the dimension of smart people.

<snippet>In this paper, a new rumor spreading model in social networks has been investigated. We propose a new version primarily based on the cholera model in order to take into account the expert pages specialized in the dissemination of rumors from an existing IRCSS model. In the second part, we recommend an optimal control strategy to fight against the spread of the rumor, and the study aims at characterizing the three optimal controls which minimize the number of spreader users, fake pages, and corresponding costs; theoretically, we have proved the existence of optimal controls, and we have given a characterization of controls in terms of states and adjoint functions based on a discrete version of Pontryagin's maximum principle. To illustrate the theoretical results obtained, we propose numerical simulations for several scenarios applying the forward-backward sweep method (FBSM) to solve our optimality system in an iterative process.

<title>Youth and social media: the affordances and challenges of online graffiti practice</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01634437211069969</url>
<snippet>The impact of social media use on youth subcultures, such as graffiti writers, has been rapid and dramatic, bringing with it a number of significant transformations that present both opportunities and challenges. This paper explores the impact of the Internet and social media on a community of graffiti practitioners. I argue that the rise and uptake of online social networking platforms such as Instagram and You Tube have offered a range of affordances to the practice of graffiti writing. These affordances include: greater accessibility to graffiti culture; learning opportunities; and opportunities for wider distribution and curation of graffiti pieces. Simultaneously, social media challenges the significance of 'community', that is, the physical social interaction afforded by participation in real world graffiti crews. The findings suggest that while there are tangible benefits from the use of the Internet and uptake of social media by the graffiti writing community, it is the physical communal bonds experienced within a graffiti crew that are vital to the wellbeing and continuity of the culture. This paper contributes to our understanding of how social media affects youth more broadly and specifically how social media platforms are transforming the experience of youth subcultural practice.

<title>Group Polarization Based on Agent Emotional Characteristics and Credibility</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/9983541</url>
<snippet>The frequent occurrence of group polarization in many internet mass incidents produces adverse impacts on the social stability and poses a significant challenge for social management. We construct an opinion evolution model with agent emotional characteristics and credibility based on the Deffuant model to study the evolutionary mechanism of group polarization, which connects the agent's firmness with the agent's opinion, taking a full account of the agent heterogeneity. We analyze the impacts of initial opinion distribution, network structure, and opinion leader on the group opinion evolution. The results show that group polarization is easier to form when the initial opinions are in a normal distribution, and group polarization will also form under the impact of initial minority agents with extreme opinions. Different network structures will pose different effects on the group opinion evolution, and group polarization is easier to form in the small-world network and BA scale-free network. In addition, opinion leader also affects the group opinion evolution, and it will hinder the generation of group polarization.

<title>Evaluation of strategies to mitigate contagion spread using social network characteristics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2013.01.002</url>
<snippet>Computer simulation is an effective tool for assessing mitigation strategies, with recent trends concentrating on agent-based techniques. These methods require high computational efforts in order to simulate enough scenarios for statistical significance. The population individuals and their contacts determined by agent-based simulations form a social network. For some network structures it is possible to gain high accuracy estimates of contagion spread based on the connection structure of the network, an idea that is utilized in this work. A representative social network constructed from the 2006 census of the Greater Toronto Area (Ontario, Canada) of 5 million individuals in 1.8 million households is used to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We examine the effects of six mitigation strategies with respect to their ability to contain disease spread as indicated by pre- and post-vaccination reproduction numbers, mean local clustering coefficients and degree distributions. One outcome of the analysis provides evidence supporting the design of mitigation strategies that aim to fragment the population into similarly sized components. While our analysis is framed in the context of pandemic disease spread, the approach is applicable to any contagion such as computer viruses, rumours, social trends, and so on.

<title>Homophily and the Speed of Social Mobilization: The Effect of Acquired and Ascribed Traits</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095140</url>
<snippet>Large-scale mobilization of individuals across social networks is becoming increasingly prevalent in society. However, little is known about what affects the speed of social mobilization. Here we use a framed field experiment to identify and measure properties of individuals and their relationships that predict mobilization speed. We ran a global social mobilization contest and recorded personal traits of the participants and those they recruited. We studied the effects of ascribed traits (gender, age) and acquired traits (geography, and information source) on the speed of mobilization. We found that homophily, a preference for interacting with other individuals with similar traits, had a mixed role in social mobilization. Homophily was present for acquired traits, in which mobilization speed was faster when the recuiter and recruit had the same trait compared to different traits. In contrast, we did not find support for homophily for the ascribed traits. Instead, those traits had other, non-homophily effects: Females mobilized other females faster than males mobilized other males. Younger recruiters mobilized others faster, and older recruits mobilized slower. Recruits also mobilized faster when they first heard about the contest directly from the contest organization, and decreased in speed when hearing from less personal source types (e. g. family vs. media). These findings show that social mobilization includes dynamics that are unlike other, more passive forms of social activity propagation. These findings suggest relevant factors for engineering social mobilization tasks for increased speed.

<title>Clustered marginalization of minorities during social transitions induced by co-evolution of behaviour and network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep30790</url>
<snippet>Large-scale transitions in societies are associated with both individual behavioural change and restructuring of the social network. These two factors have often been considered independently, yet recent advances in social network research challenge this view. Here we show that common features of societal marginalization and clustering emerge naturally during transitions in a co-evolutionary adaptive network model. This is achieved by explicitly considering the interplay between individual interaction and a dynamic network structure in behavioural selection. We exemplify this mechanism by simulating how smoking behaviour and the network structure get reconfigured by changing social norms. Our results are consistent with empirical findings: The prevalence of smoking was reduced, remaining smokers were preferentially connected among each other and formed increasingly marginalized clusters. We propose that self-amplifying feedbacks between individual behaviour and dynamic restructuring of the network are main drivers of the transition. This generative mechanism for co-evolution of individual behaviour and social network structure may apply to a wide range of examples beyond smoking.

<title>An Agent-Based Model of Electricity Consumer: Smart Metering Policy Implications in Europe</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3150</url>
<snippet>EU Regulation 2009/72/EC concerning commonrules for internal market in electricity calls upon 80&#37; of EU electricity consumers to be equipped with smart metering systems by 2020, provided that a positive economic assessment of all long-term costs and benefits to the market and the individual consumer is guaranteed. Understanding the impact that smart metering systems may have on the electricity stakeholders (consumers, distribution system operators, energy suppliers and the society at large) is important for faster and effective deployment of such systems and of the innovative services they offer. For this purpose, in this paper an agent-based model is developed, where the electricity consumer behaviour due to different smart metering policies is simulated. Consumers are modelled as household agents having dynamic preferences on types of electricity contracts offered by the supplier. Development of preferences depends on personal values, memory and attitudes, as well as the degree of interaction in a social network structure. We are interested in exploring possible diffusion rates of smart metering enabled services under different policy interventions and the impact of this technological diffusion on individual and societal performance indicators. In four simulation experiments and three intervention policies we observe the diffusion of energy services and individual and societal performance indicators (electricity savings, CO2 emissions savings, social welfare, consumers' comfort change), as well as consumers' satisfaction. From these results and based on expert validation, we conclude that providing the consumer with more options does not necessarily lead to higher consumer's satisfaction, or better societal performance. A good policy should be centred on effective ways to tackle consumers concerns.

<title>Social Network Influence on Online Behavioral Choices: Exploring Group Formation on Social Network Sites</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764214527092</url>
<snippet>Social media communication is characterized by reduced anonymity and off-to-online social interactions. These characteristics require scholars to revisit social influence mechanisms online. The current study builds on social influence literature to explore social network and gender effects on online behavior. Findings from a quasi-experiment suggest that both network-related variables and gender are significantly associated with online behavior. Perceived social environment, measured by personal network exposure rate, is more significant than objective reality, measured by frequency of received social messages, in determining behavior. We discuss the implications of social contagion effects on web-based strategic communication-including advertising, political campaigns, and social mobilization. Data limitations and the difficulty of measuring social network influence via social media are also discussed.

<title>Responsiveness of Mining Community Acceptance Model to Key Parameter Changes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3458</url>
<snippet>The mining industry has difficulties predicting changes in the level of community acceptance of its projects over time. These changes are due to changes in the society and individual perceptions around these mines as a result of the mines' environmental and social impacts. Agent-based modeling can be used to facilitate better understanding of how community acceptance changes with changing mine environmental impacts. This work investigates the sensitivity of an agent-based model (ABM) for predicting changes in community acceptance of a mining project due to information diffusion to key input parameters. Specifically, this study investigates the responsiveness of the ABM to average degree (total number of friends) of the social network, close neighbour ratio (a measure of homophily in the social network) and number of early adopters ("innovators"). A two-level full factorial experiment was used to investigate the sensitivity of the model to these parameters. The primary (main), secondary and tertiary effects of each parameter were estimated to assess the model's sensitivity. The results show that the model is more responsive to close neighbour ratio and number of early adopters than average degree. Consequently, uncertainty surrounding the inferences drawn from simulation experiments using the agent-based model will be minimized by obtaining more reliable estimates of close neighbour ratio and number of early adopters. While it is possible to reliably estimate the level of early adopters from the literature, the degree of homophily (close neighbour ratio) has to be estimated from surveys that can be expensive and unreliable. Further, work is required to find economic ways to document relevant degrees of homophily in social networks in mining communities.

<title>The structural architecture of international industry networks in the global economy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255450</url>
<snippet>Globalisation continuously produces novel economic relationships mediated by flows of goods, services, capital, and information between countries. The activity of multinational corporations (MNCs) has become a primary driver of globalisation, shaping these relationships through vast networks of firms and their subsidiaries. Extensive empirical research has suggested that globalisation is not a singular process, and that variation in the intensity of international economic interactions can be captured by 'multiple globalisations', however how this differs across industry sectors has remained unclear. This paper analyses how sectoral variation in the 'structural architecture' of international economic relations can be understood using a combination of social network analysis (SNA) measures based on firm-subsidiary ownership linkages. Applying an approach that combines network-level measures (Density, Clustering, Degree, Assortativity) in ways yet to be explored in the spatial networks literature, a typology of four idealised international network structures is presented to allow for comparison between sectors. All sectoral networks were found to be disassortative, indicating that international networks based on intraorganisational ties are characterised by a core-periphery structure, with professional services sectors such as Banks and Insurance being the most hierarchically differentiated. Retail sector networks, including Food &amp; Staples Retailing, are the least clustered while the two most clustered networks-Materials and Capital Goods-have also the highest average degree, evidence of their extensive globalisations. Our findings suggest that the multiple globalisations characterising international economic interactions can be better understood through the 'structural architecture' of sectoral variation, which result from the advantages conferred by cross-border activity within each.

<title>Sequential sampling enhanced composite likelihood approach to estimation of social intercorrelations in large-scale networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11129-018-9199-z</url>
<snippet>The increasing access to large social network data has generated substantial interest in the marketing community. However, due to its large scale, traditional analysis methods often become inadequate. In this paper, we propose a sequential sampling enhanced composite likelihood approach for efficient estimation of social intercorrelations in large-scale networks using the spatial model. Given a known population network, the proposed approach sequentially takes small samples from the network, and adaptively improves model parameter estimates through learnings obtained from previous samples. In comparison to population-based maximum likelihood estimation that is computationally prohibitive when the network size is large, the proposed approach makes it computationally feasible to analyze large networks and provide efficient estimation of social intercorrelations among members in large networks. In comparison to sample-based estimation that relies on information purely from the sample and produces underestimation bias in social intercorrelation estimates, the proposed approach effectively uses information from the population without compromising computation efficiency. Through simulation studies based on simulated networks and real networks, we demonstrate significant advantages of the proposed approach over benchmark estimation methods and discuss managerial implications. We also discuss extension of the proposed approach in the context of an unknown population network structure, as well as in an alternative form of the spatial model.

<title>Influence of network dynamics on the spread of sexually transmitted diseases</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2011.0445</url>
<snippet>Network epidemiology often assumes that the relationships defining the social network of a population are static. The dynamics of relationships is only taken indirectly into account by assuming that the relevant information to study epidemic spread is encoded in the network obtained, by considering numbers of partners accumulated over periods of time roughly proportional to the infectious period of the disease. On the other hand, models explicitly including social dynamics are often too schematic to provide a reasonable representation of a real population, or so detailed that no general conclusions can be drawn from them. Here, we present a model of social dynamics that is general enough so its parameters can be obtained by fitting data from surveys about sexual behaviour, but that can still be studied analytically, using mean-field techniques. This allows us to obtain some general results about epidemic spreading. We show that using accumulated network data to estimate the static epidemic threshold lead to a significant underestimation of that threshold. We also show that, for a dynamic network, the relative epidemic threshold is an increasing function of the infectious period of the disease, implying that the static value is a lower bound to the real threshold. A practical example is given of how to apply the model to the study of a real population.

<title>Link creation and information spreading over social and communication ties in an interest-based online social network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds12</url>
<snippet>Complex dynamics of social media emerge from the interaction between the patterns of social connectivity of users and the information exchanged along such social ties. Unveiling the underlying mechanisms that drive the evolution of online social systems requires a deep understanding of the interplay between these two aspects. Based on the case of the aNobii social network, an online service for book readers, we investigate the dynamics of link creation and the social influence phenomenon that may trigger information diffusion in the social graph. By confirming that social partner selection is strongly driven by structural, geographical, and topical proximity, we develop a machine-learning social link recommender for individual users trained on a set of features selected as best predictive out of several and we test it on the still widely unexplored domain of a network of interest. We also analyze the influence process from the two distinct perspectives of users and items. We show that link creation plays an immediate effect on the alignment of user profiles and that the established social ties are a good substrate for social influence. We quantitatively measure influence by tracking the patterns of diffusion of specific pieces of information and comparing them with appropriate null models. We discover an appreciable signal of social influence even though item consumption is a very slow process in this context. All the detected patterns of social attachment and influence are observed to be stronger when considering the social subgraph on which communication effectively occurs. Based on our study of the dynamics of the aNobii social network, we investigate the possibility to predict the evolution of such a complex social system.

<title>Inferring Social Network Structure from Bacterial Sequence Data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0022685</url>
<snippet>Using DNA sequence data from pathogens to infer transmission networks has traditionally been done in the context of epidemics and outbreaks. Sequence data could analogously be applied to cases of ubiquitous commensal bacteria; however, instead of inferring chains of transmission to track the spread of a pathogen, sequence data for bacteria circulating in an endemic equilibrium could be used to infer information about host contact networks. Here, we show-using simulated data-that multilocus DNA sequence data, based on multilocus sequence typing schemes (MLST), from isolates of commensal bacteria can be used to infer both local and global properties of the contact networks of the populations being sampled. Specifically, for MLST data simulated from small-world networks, the small world parameter controlling the degree of structure in the contact network can robustly be estimated. Moreover, we show that pairwise distances in the network-degrees of separation-correlate with genetic distances between isolates, so that how far apart two individuals in the network are can be inferred from MLST analysis of their commensal bacteria. This result has important consequences, and we show an example from epidemiology: how this result could be used to test for infectious origins of diseases of unknown etiology.

<title>Latent network models to account for noisy, multiply reported social network data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jrsssa/qnac004</url>
<snippet>Social network data are often constructed by incorporating reports from multiple individuals. However, it is not obvious how to reconcile discordant responses from individuals. There may be particular risks with multiply reported data if people's responses reflect normative expectations-such as an expectation of balanced, reciprocal relationships. Here, we propose a probabilistic model that incorporates ties reported by multiple individuals to estimate the unobserved network structure. In addition to estimating a parameter for each reporter that is related to their tendency of over- or under-reporting relationships, the model explicitly incorporates a term for 'mutuality', the tendency to report ties in both directions involving the same alter. Our model's algorithmic implementation is based on variational inference, which makes it efficient and scalable to large systems. We apply our model to data from a Nicaraguan community collected with a roster-based design and 75 Indian villages collected with a name-generator design. We observe strong evidence of 'mutuality' in both datasets, and find that this value varies by relationship type. Consequently, our model estimates networks with reciprocity values that are substantially different than those resulting from standard deterministic aggregation approaches, demonstrating the need to consider such issues when gathering, constructing, and analysing survey-based network data.

<title>Anomaly detection in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.05.002</url>
<snippet>Anomalies in online social networks can signify irregular, and often illegal behaviour. Detection of such anomalies has been used to identify malicious individuals, including spammers, sexual predators, and online fraudsters. In this paper we survey existing computational techniques for detecting anomalies in online social networks. We characterise anomalies as being either static or dynamic, and as being labelled or unlabelled, and survey methods for detecting these different types of anomalies. We suggest that the detection of anomalies in online social networks is composed of two sub-processes; the selection and calculation of network features, and the classification of observations from this feature space. In addition, this paper provides an overview of the types of problems that anomaly detection can address and identifies key areas for future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Evolution of non-kin cooperation: social assortment by cooperative phenotype in guppies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.181493</url>
<snippet>Cooperation among non-kin constitutes a conundrum for evolutionary biology. Theory suggests that non-kin cooperation can evolve if individuals differ consistently in their cooperative phenotypes and assort socially by these, such that cooperative individuals interact predominantly with one another. However, our knowledge of the role of cooperative phenotypes in the social structuring of real-world animal populations is minimal. In this study, we investigated cooperative phenotypes and their link to social structure in wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). We first investigated whether wild guppies are repeatable in their individual levels of cooperativeness (i.e. have cooperative phenotypes) and found evidence for this in seven out of eight populations, a result which was mostly driven by females. We then examined the social network structure of one of these populations where the expected fitness impact of cooperative contexts is relatively high, and found assortment by cooperativeness, but not by genetic relatedness. By contrast, and in accordance with our expectations, we did not find assortment by cooperativeness in a population where the expected fitness impact of cooperative contexts is lower. Our results provide empirical support for current theory and suggest that assortment by cooperativeness is important for the evolution and persistence of non-kin cooperation in real-world populations.

<title>Exploring dynamic networks: hypotheses and conjectures</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-8733(00)00025-3</url>
<snippet>Previously, theories of network exchange and their applications focused only on static configurations. The purpose of this paper is to show that exchange networks with dynamic structures can be analyzed using Network Exchange Theory (NET) even though that theory was developed with only static networks in mind. The Exchange Seek Likelihood (ESL) and Optimal-Seek methods of NET are used. Hypotheses, which focus on network dynamics from the perspective of the network as a whole and from the perspective of individual actors, are both considered. The only previous paper on exchange networks with dynamic structures is that of Leik [Leik, Robert K. 1992. New directions for NET: stategic manipulation of network linkages. Social Networks. 14: 309 - 324.]. Since the issues he considered continue to be significant, we use his paper to guide our analysis, offering new hypotheses and conjectures for the issues he considered. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

<snippet>Incentive-based models for network formation link micro actions to changes in network structure. Sociologists have extended these models on a number of fronts, but there remains a tendency to treat actors as homogenous agents and to disregard social theory. Drawing upon literature on the strategic use of networks for knowledge gains, we specify models exploring the co-evolution of networks and knowledge gains. Our findings suggest that pursuing transitive ties is the most successful strategy, as more reciprocity and cycling result from this pursuit, thus encouraging learning across the network. We also discuss the role of network size, global network structure, and parameter strength in actors' attainment of knowledge resources.

<title>Consensus and polarization in competing complex contagion processes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2019.0196</url>
<snippet>The rate of adoption of new information depends on reinforcement from multiple sources in a way that often cannot be described by simple contagion processes. In such cases, contagion is said to be complex. Complex contagion happens in the diffusion of human behaviours, innovations and knowledge. Based on that evidence, we propose a model that considers multiple, potentially asymmetric and competing contagion processes and analyse its respective population-wide dynamics, bringing together ideas from complex contagion, opinion dynamics, evolutionary game theory and language competition by shifting the focus from individuals to the properties of the diffusing processes. We show that our model spans a dynamical space in which the population exhibits patterns of consensus, dominance, and, importantly, different types of polarization, a more diverse dynamical environment that contrasts with single simple contagion processes. We show how these patterns emerge and how different population structures modify them through a natural development of spatial correlations: structured interactions increase the range of the dominance regime by reducing that of dynamic polarization, tight modular structures can generate structural polarization, depending on the interplay between fundamental properties of the processes and the modularity of the interaction network.

<title>Fractal structure of human and primate social networks optimizes information flow</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2023.0028</url>
<snippet>Primate and human social groups exhibit a fractal structure that has a very limited range of preferred layer sizes, with groups of 5, 15, 50 and (in humans) 150 and 500 predominating. In non-human primates, this same fractal distribution is also observed in the distribution of species mean group sizes and in the internal network structure of their groups. Here we demonstrate that this preferential numbering arises because of the critical nature of dynamic self-organization within complex social networks. We calculate the size dependence of the scaling properties of complex social network models and argue that this aggregate behaviour exhibits a form of collective intelligence. Direct calculation establishes that the complexity of social networks as measured by their scaling behaviour is non-monotonic, peaking globally around 150 with a secondary peak at 500 and tertiary peaks at 5, 15 and 50. This provides a theory-based rationale for the fractal layering of primate and human social groups.

<title>Reinforced structural holes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2015.04.008</url>
<snippet>Holes in social structure are variably reinforced by the social organization around the hole. The more reinforced the hole, the greater the difficulty in bridging it, but the more likely a successful bridge will carry information novel, and so potentially valuable, to people on the other side. To study how reinforcement varies with access to structural holes, and the achievement associated with access, I propose a measure of access to reinforced structural holes (RSH), and present results predicting achievement in an integrated banker organization and a balkanized supply-chain organization. In both study populations, the people who have access to structural holes also have access to reinforced structural holes, and all measures of access have a statistically significant association with achievement. However, there is no consistent prediction advantage from incorporating reinforcement in measures of access to structural holes. The reinforced-holes measure predicts compensation better or as well as network constraint and betweenness, but is weaker or no better than a count of nonredundant contacts. I do not infer from the results a rank-order of alternative measures so much as substitutability. I expect achievement to be associated with access to structural holes, but I expect the association to vary across alternative measures depending on how achievement is achieved in a specific population.

<title>Impact of social network structure on content propagation: A study using YouTube data</title>

<snippet>We study how the size and structure of the local network around a node affects the aggregate diffusion of products seeded by it. We examine this in the context of YouTube, the popular video-sharing site. We address the endogeneity problems common to this setting by using a rich dataset and a careful estimation methodology. We empirically demonstrate that the size and structure of an author's local network is a significant driver of the popularity of videos seeded by her, even after controlling for observed and unobserved video characteristics, unobserved author characteristics, and endogenous network formation. Our findings are distinct from those in the peer effects literature, which examines neighborhood effects on individual behavior, since we document the causal relationship between a node's local network position and the global diffusion of products seeded by it. Our results provide guidelines for identifying seeds that provide the best return on investment, thereby aiding managers conducting buzz marketing campaigns on social media forums. Further, our study sheds light on the other substantive factors that affect video consumption on YouTube.

<title>Official vs. underground Protestant churches in China: Challenges for reconciliation and social influence</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3512231</url>
<snippet>Protestant Christianity in China is divided into two segments, an official Protestant church and unofficial, "underground" church. As China's doors are opening to increased capitalism and modernization, the Protestant church in China may have the potential to offer a much-needed stabilizing societal influence. This article examines the strengths and weaknesses of both the official and unofficial Protestant churches from an organizational perspective. Four organizational theories - social construct theory, social network theory, religious marketplace theory, and religious cultural influence theory - are employed in evaluating each church group potential for influencing a changing Chinese society and the likelihood that the two churches will unite in that effort. Each church group has developed distinctive qualities that make social influence possible but in limited venues and with limited groups of people. Their unique but conflicting characteristics make it unlikely that the two would become a united Protestant church.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12101656</url>
<snippet>Social networking sites (SNSs) are now ubiquitous communities for constant online interpersonal interactions that trigger symmetric or asymmetric effects on our everyday life. Recent studies advocate in favor of the significant role that SNSs have in promoting well-being and, more importantly, in disseminating reliable information during a global crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the growing importance of SNSs to the global framework, the main purpose of this study is to empirically assess the link between the use of symmetric social networks such as Facebook, or asymmetric social networks, like Instagram, and the level of satisfaction, employing the methodology of structural equation modeling. The results of the research validate the hypothesis that SNS activities increase the level of satisfaction, and therefore, that there is a direct link between the number of posts and comments and the level of satisfaction. Furthermore, based on the reversible and significant link between the level of satisfaction and the importance attributed to SNSs, the main conclusion of the study is that the higher the importance of the SNS, the greater the level of dissatisfaction experienced by users. Also, public activities on social networks positively affect social network satisfaction, while private activities have a direct negative relationship with the importance of social networks.

<title>A Stakeholder Network for Managing Multiple Forest Stressors and Roadside Forests</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2023.2267500</url>
<snippet>Roadside forests are susceptible to damage from storm events given their exposure and related vulnerability to impacts of multiple stressors. Challenges to management are further complicated in exurban landscapes, where roadside forests are interspersed among fragmented land ownership entities with diverse management objectives. Our objective was to evaluate forest management community information sharing about biophysical stressors affecting roadside vegetation for multiple forestland tract types in Connecticut. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews (n = 39). Results from social network analysis illustrated network structure and interrelationship patterns among community members. Overall network cohesion was low. Core network positions were dominated by few stakeholders. Communication occurred among subgroups comprised of individuals representing several different stakeholder occupation groups. Low cohesion may be inherent of the fragmented exurban landscape with relations focused on shared objectives. Community longevity may depend upon maintaining core-position connections and a less-centralized network composed of individuals from various occupations.

<title>Social Network Research contribution to evaluating process in a feasibility study of a peer-led and school-based sexual health intervention</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90852-w</url>
<snippet>There is growing interest in social network-based programmes to improve health, but rigorous methods using Social Network research to evaluate the process of these interventions is less well developed. Using data from the "STis And Sexual Health" (STASH) feasibility trial of a school-based, peer-led intervention on sexual health prevention, we illustrate how network data analysis results can address key components of process evaluations for complex interventions-implementation, mechanisms of impacts, and context. STASH trained students as Peer Supporters (PS) to diffuse sexual health messages though face-to-face interactions and online Facebook (FB) groups. We applied a Multilevel Exponential Random Graph modelling approach to analyse the interdependence between offline friendship relationships and online FB ties and how these different relationships align. Our results suggest that the creation of online FB communities mirrored offline adolescent groups, demonstrating fidelity of intervention delivery. Data on informal friendship networks related to student's individual characteristics (i.e., demographics, sexual health knowledge and adherence to norms, which were included for STASH), contributed to an understanding of the social relational 'building' mechanisms that sustain tie-formation. This knowledge could assist the selection of opinion leaders, improving identification of influential peers situated in optimal network positions. This work provides a novel contribution to understanding how to integrate network research with the process evaluation of a network intervention.

<title>An entropy-based method to control COVID-19 rumors in online social networks using opinion leaders</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.102048</url>
<snippet>-In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, people spread various COVID-19-related rumors and hoaxes that negatively influence human civilization through online social networks (OSN). The proposed research addresses the unique and innovative approach to controlling COVID-19 rumors through the power of opinion leaders (OLs) in OSN. The entire process is partitioned into two phases; the first phase describes the novel Reputation-based Opinion Leader Identification (ROLI) algorithm, including a unique voting method to identify the top-T OLs in the OSN. The second phase describes the technique to measure the aggregated polarity score of each posted tweet/post and compute each user's reputation. The empirical reputation is utilized to calculate the user's trust, the post's entropy, and its veracity. If the experimental entropy of the post is lower than the empirical threshold value, the post is likely to be categorized as a rumor. The proposed approach operated on Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit social networks for validation. The ROLI algorithm provides 91&#37; accuracy, 93&#37; precision, 95&#37; recall, and 94&#37; F1-score over other Social Network Analysis (SNA) measures to find OLs in OSN. Moreover, the proposed approach's rumor controlling effectiveness and efficiency is also estimated based on three standard metrics; affected degree, represser degree, and diffuser degree, and obtained 26&#37;, 22&#37;, and 23&#37; improvement, respectively. The concluding outcomes illustrate that the influence of OLs is exceptionally significant in controlling COVID-19 rumors.

<title>Towards quantifying the communication aspect of resilience in disaster-prone communities</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-59192-3</url>
<snippet>In this study, we investigate the communication networks of urban, suburban, and rural communities from three US Midwest counties through a stochastic model that simulates the diffusion of information over time in disaster and in normal situations. To understand information diffusion in communities, we investigate the interplay of information that individuals get from online social networks, local news, government sources, mainstream media, and print media. We utilize survey data collected from target communities and create graphs of each community to quantify node-to-node and source-to-node interactions, as well as trust patterns. Monte Carlo simulation results show the average time it takes for information to propagate to 90&#37; of the population for each community. We conclude that rural, suburban, and urban communities have different inherent properties promoting the varied flow of information. Also, information sources affect information spread differently, causing degradation of information speed if any source becomes unavailable. Finally, we provide insights on the optimal investments to improve disaster communication based on community features and contexts.

<title>How Do Online Social Networks Grow?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100023</url>
<snippet>Online social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Gowalla allow people to communicate and interact across borders. In past years online social networks have become increasingly important for studying the behavior of individuals, group formation, and the emergence of online societies. Here we focus on the characterization of the average growth of online social networks and try to understand which are possible processes behind seemingly long-range temporal correlated collective behavior. In agreement with recent findings, but in contrast to Gibrat's law of proportionate growth, we find scaling in the average growth rate and its standard deviation. In contrast, Renren and Twitter deviate, however, in certain important aspects significantly from those found in many social and economic systems. Whereas independent methods suggest no significance for temporally long-range correlated behavior for Renren and Twitter, a scaling analysis of the standard deviation does suggest long-range temporal correlated growth in Gowalla. However, we demonstrate that seemingly long-range temporal correlations in the growth of online social networks, such as in Gowalla, can be explained by a decomposition into temporally and spatially independent growth processes with a large variety of entry rates. Our analysis thus suggests that temporally or spatially correlated behavior does not play a major role in the growth of online social networks.

<title>Homophily, networks, and critical mass: Solving the start-up problem in large group collective action</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1043463112473734</url>
<snippet>Formal theories of collective action face the problem that in large groups a single actor makes such a small impact on the collective good that cooperation is irrational. Critical mass theorists argue that this 'large group problem' can be solved by an initial critical mass of contributors, whose efforts can produce a 'bandwagon' effect, making cooperation rational for the remaining members of the population. However, critical mass theory requires an explanation of how a critical mass can form in the first place. I present a model of collective action that solves this problem by showing how aspects of social structure - including network topology, homophily, and local coalition formation - can allow rational actors to endogenously form a critical mass. The findings indicate that as the mobilization effort becomes more 'complex', clustered networks and homophily become increasingly important for critical mass collective action.

<title>Empirically measuring online social influence</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-024-00492-z</url>
<snippet>Social influence pervades our everyday lives and lays the foundation for complex social phenomena, such as the spread of misinformation and the polarization of communities. A disconnect appears between psychology approaches, generally performed and tested in controlled lab experiments, and quantitative methods, which are usually data-driven and rely on network and event analysis. The former are slow, expensive to deploy, and typically do not generalize well to topical issues; the latter often oversimplify the complexities of social influence and ignore psychosocial literature. This work bridges this gap by introducing a human-in-the-loop active learning method that empirically quantifies social influence by crowdsourcing pairwise influence comparisons. We develop simulation and fitting tools, allowing us to estimate the required budget based on the design features and the worker's decision accuracy. We perform a series of pilot studies to quantify the impact of design features on worker accuracy. We deploy our method to estimate the influence ranking of 500 X/Twitter users. We validate our measure by showing that the obtained empirical influence is tightly linked with agency and communion, the Big Two of social cognition, with agency being the most important dimension for influence formation.

<title>Market integration reduces kin density in women's ego-networks in rural Poland</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-14158-2</url>
<snippet>It is widely assumed that as populations become more market integrated the 'inner circles' of people's social networks become less densely connected and family-oriented. This 'loosening' of kin networks may fundamentally alter the social dynamics of reproduction, facilitating demographic transitions to low fertility. Few data exist to test this hypothesis. Previous research in urbanized populations has not explicitly measured kin density in ego-networks, nor assessed how market integration influences network structure at different levels of aggregation. Here I analyze the ego-networks of similar to 2000 women in 22 rural Polish communities transitioning from subsistence farming to market-dependence. I compare how ego-network size, density and kin density co-vary with household and community-level market integration. Market integration is associated with less kin-dense networks, but not necessarily less dense ones, and is unrelated to network size. Declining kin density during economic transitions may be a critical mechanism for the broader cultural transmission of low fertility values. Market integration may loosen the dense kinship networks maintaining high fertility among agriculturalists, but data are lacking. Here, Colleran shows that in 22 rural Polish communities, women's ego networks are less kin-oriented, but not less dense, as market integration increases, potentially enabling low fertility values to spread.

<title>Social networks reveal cultural behaviour in tool-using using dolphins</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms1983</url>
<snippet>Animal tool use is of inherent interest given its relationship to intelligence, innovation and cultural behaviour. Here we investigate whether Shark Bay bottlenose dolphins that use marine sponges as hunting tools (spongers) are culturally distinct from other dolphins in the population based on the criteria that sponging is both socially learned and distinguishes between groups. We use social network analysis to determine social preferences among 36 spongers and 69 non-spongers sampled over a 22-year period while controlling for location, sex and matrilineal relatedness. Homophily (the tendency to associate with similar others) based on tool-using status was evident in every analysis, although maternal kinship, sex and location also contributed to social preference. Female spongers were more cliquish and preferentially associated with other spongers over non-spongers. Like humans who preferentially associate with others who share their subculture, tool-using dolphins prefer others like themselves, strongly suggesting that sponge tool-use is a cultural behaviour.

<title>Structure and formation of top networks in international trade, 2001-2010</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2015.07.006</url>
<snippet>We propose the construction of the international trade network based on top trade relations (i.e., country i is linked to country j if j is i's top trade partner). The constructed network captures most important relations in international trade. The overall network displays a tree-like hierarchical structure. It is organized around global central countries (especially the US, China, and Germany) under which there are more levels of local centers. We develop a model that uses country behavior in local triadic environment to account for the formation of such network structure. The census of triads confirms the applicability of this model.

<title>Inferring population-level contact heterogeneity from common epidemic data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2012.0578</url>
<snippet>Models of infectious disease spread that incorporate contact heterogeneity through contact networks are an important tool for epidemiologists studying disease dynamics and assessing intervention strategies. One of the challenges of contact network epidemiology has been the difficulty of collecting individual and population-level data needed to develop an accurate representation of the underlying host population's contact structure. In this study, we evaluate the utility of common epidemiological measures (R-0, epidemic peak size, duration and final size) for inferring the degree of heterogeneity in a population's unobserved contact structure through a Bayesian approach. We test the method using ground truth data and find that some of these epidemiological metrics are effective at classifying contact heterogeneity. The classification is also consistent across pathogen transmission probabilities, and so can be applied even when this characteristic is unknown. In particular, the reproductive number, R-0, turns out to be a poor classifier of the degree heterogeneity, while, unexpectedly, final epidemic size is a powerful predictor of network structure across the range of heterogeneity. We also evaluate our framework on empirical epidemiological data from past and recent outbreaks to demonstrate its application in practice and to gather insights about the relevance of particular contact structures for both specific systems and general classes of infectious disease. We thus introduce a simple approach that can shed light on the unobserved connectivity of a host population given epidemic data. Our study has the potential to inform future data-collection efforts and study design by driving our understanding of germane epidemic measures, and highlights a general inferential approach to learning about host contact structure in contemporary or historic populations of humans and animals.

<title>Psychological Ownership and Ambivalent Employee Behaviors: A Moderated Mediation Model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440231162535</url>
<snippet>Prior studies regard psychological ownership as a positive thing, but this study suggested two faces of psychological ownership. Specifically, we focused on the psychological process wherein two different routes via disparate mediators led to two seemingly contradictory outcomes: organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and workplace aggressive behavior (WAB). In addition, we also examined the moderating role of a structural factor (i.e., network position) in the mediation process. Drawing on the social exchange theory, we proposed that psychological ownership would produce both OCB and WAB through organization-based self-esteem and psychological entitlement respectively, and an individual's network position would moderate the effects of this process. Data from 189 nurses from a general hospital in Korea revealed that psychological ownership was positively related to two ambivalent outcomes, OCB and WAB. Further, a central position in a friendship network among nurses strengthened the positive relationship between psychological ownership and OCB. Overall, this study showed that psychological ownership was like a double-edged sword. We discussed the theoretical and practical implications of this finding.

<snippet>The Global Compact on Migration and International Organizations pay increasing focus to fair migrant labor recruitment. By looking at the temporary migration of Guatemalans to Canada, this paper demonstrates that migrants play a crucial role in managing labor migration. Based on interviews with Guatemalan migrants, recruiters, and Canadian employers, I analyze the dual role of migrants, as both producers and subjects of recruitment practices. I build upon the concept of the migration industry to show how this phenomenon creates a grey zone of migration brokerage at the crossroads of business and social networks, problematizing the global discourse on fair recruitment.

<title>The Evolution of Homophily</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep00845</url>
<snippet>Biologists have devoted much attention to assortative mating or homogamy, the tendency for sexual species tomate with similar others. In contrast, there has been little theoretical work on the broader phenomenon of homophily, the tendency for individuals to interact with similar others. Yet this behaviour is also widely observed in nature. Here, we model how natural selection can give rise to homophily when individuals engage in social interaction in a population with multiple observable phenotypes. Payoffs to interactions depend on whether or not individuals have the same or different phenotypes, and each individual has a preference that determines how likely they are to interact with others of their own phenotype (homophily) or of opposite phenotypes (heterophily). The results show that homophily tends to evolve under a wide variety of conditions, helping to explain its ubiquity in nature.

<title>Quantifying the Benefits of Link-Tracing Designs for Partnership Network Studies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1525822X11433997</url>
<snippet>Difficult-to-reach populations are frequently sampled through various link tracing-based designs, which rely on interpersonal networks to identify members of the population. This article examines the substantive returns to one such multiple-link tracing design in the Colorado Springs "project 90" human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk networks study. Cross-links were respondents who were targeted for enrollment because of being named as partners by at least two other respondents in the sample. The authors compare cross-links to other respondents on sociodemographic characteristics and network properties using bivariate and multivariate adjusted statistics. The authors evaluate their contributions to observed network structure by creating a set of counterfactual networks deleting the information they provided. Results suggest that the link-tracing techniques led to identifying populations that would have otherwise been missed and that their absence would have underestimated potential HIV risk by distorting epidemiologically relevant measures within the network.

<title>A Man's world? Comparing the structural positions of men and women in an organized criminal network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10611-020-09910-5</url>
<snippet>The crime gender gap is the difference between the levels of participation of men and women in crime, with men responsible for more crime than women. Recent evidence suggests that the crime gender gap is closing, both in crime in general and in organized crime. However, organized crime differs from other forms of criminal activity in that it entails an organizational structure of cooperation among offenders. Assessing whether the gender gap in organized crime is narrowing is not only about the overall levels of involvement of women, but about their roles and positions within the organized criminal structure, because the involvement of women does not mean that they are in influential positions, or that they have power or access to resources important for the commission of organized crime. This paper uses a social network approach to systematically compare the structural positions of men and women in an organized criminal network. We use a dataset collected by Canadian Law Enforcement consisting of 1390 individuals known or suspected to be involved in organized crime, 185 of whom are women. Our analysis provides evidence for an ongoing gender gap in organized crime, with women occupying structural positions that are generally associated with a lack of power. Overall, women are less present in the network, tend to collaborate with other women rather than with men, and are more often in the disadvantageous position of being connected by male intermediaries. Implications for theory and law enforcement practice are discussed.

<title>Homophily and Contagion Are Generically Confounded in Observational Social Network Studies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0049124111404820</url>
<snippet>The authors consider processes on social networks that can potentially involve three factors: homophily, or the formation of social ties due to matching individual traits; social contagion, also known as social influence; and the causal effect of an individual's covariates on his or her behavior or other measurable responses. The authors show that generically, all of these are confounded with each other. Distinguishing them from one another requires strong assumptions on the parametrization of the social process or on the adequacy of the covariates used (or both). In particular the authors demonstrate, with simple examples, that asymmetries in regression coefficients cannot identify causal effects and that very simple models of imitation (a form of social contagion) can produce substantial correlations between an individual's enduring traits and his or her choices, even when there is no intrinsic affinity between them. The authors also suggest some possible constructive responses to these results.

<title>`Wives Are the Route to Social Life': An Analysis of Family Life and Networking amongst Highly Skilled Migrants in London</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0038038512475109</url>
<snippet>There is developing interest in the role of social networks in migratory experiences of highly skilled migrants. While there is some research on the networking of single economic actors, there is less focus on the social ties associated with family life and parenting among highly skilled migrants. The limited research that has been undertaken, mainly in the USA, points to the role of trailing wives' in building local social relationships. This article draws on a study of French highly skilled families in London, and explores the role of women in negotiating access to local social ties. Following Eve, we use social network theory to explore the composition, function and dynamism of these social relationships and develop a sociological explanation' of networking strategies. We contribute to understanding the human face' of highly skilled migrants, by examining the opportunities and the unanticipated obstacles they encounter in building new social ties.

<title>Gift-Giving and Network Structure in Rural China: Utilizing Long-Term Spontaneous Gift Records</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0102104</url>
<snippet>The tradition of keeping written records of gift received during household ceremonies in many countries offers researchers an underutilized means of data collection for social network analysis. This paper first summarizes unique features of the gift record data that circumvent five prevailing sampling and measurement issues in the literature, and we discuss their advantages over existing studies at both the individual level and the dyadic link level using previous data sources. We then document our research project in rural China that implements a multiple wave census-type household survey and a long-term gift record collection. The pattern of gift-giving in major household social events and its recent escalation is analyzed. There are significantly positive correlations between gift network centrality and various forms of informal insurance. Finally, economic inequality and competitive marriage market are among the main demographic and socioeconomic determinants of the observed gift network structure.

<title>Does proximity matter? Distance dependence of adolescent friendships</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2011.01.002</url>
<snippet>Geographic proximity is a determinant factor of friendship. Friendship datasets that include detailed geographic information are scarce, and when this information is available, the dependence of friendship on distance is often modelled by pre-specified parametric functions or derived from theory without further empirical assessment. This paper aims to give a detailed representation of the association between distance and the likelihood of friendship existence and friendship dynamics, and how this is modified by a few basic social and individual factors. The data employed is a three-wave network of 336 adolescents living in a small Swedish town, for whom information has been collected on their household locations. The analysis is a three-step process that combines (1) nonparametric logistic regressions to unravel the overall functional form of the dependence of friendship on distance, without assuming it has a particular strength or shape; (2) parametric logistic regressions to construct suitable transformations of distance that can be employed in (3) stochastic models for longitudinal network data, to assess how distance, individual covariates, and network structure shape adolescent friendship dynamics. It was found that the log-odds of friendship existence and friendship dynamics decrease smoothly with the logarithm of distance. For adolescents in different schools the dependence is linear, and stronger than for adolescents in the same school. Living nearby accounts, in this dataset, for an aspect of friendship dynamics that is not explicitly modelled by network structure or by individual covariates. In particular, the estimated distance effect is not correlated with reciprocity or transitivity effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>When is brokerage negatively associated with economic benefits? Ethnic diversity, competition, and common-pool resources</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2015.11.004</url>
<snippet>There is a growing body of literature positively linking dimensions of social capital to economic benefits. Yet recent research also points to a potential "dark side" of social capital, where over-embeddedness in networks and the pressures associated with brokerage are hypothesized to constrain actors, having a negative effect on economic outcomes. This dichotomy suggests that context is important, yet the overwhelming majority of existing empirical evidence stems from socially homogenous populations in corporate and organizational settings, limiting a broader understanding of when and how context matters. We advance this discourse to a socially fragmented, ethnically diverse common-pool resource system where information is highly valuable and competition is fierce. Merging several unique datasets from Hawaii's pelagic tuna fishery, we find that network prominence, i.e., being well connected locally, has a significant, positive effect on economic productivity. In contrast, we find that brokerage, defined here as ties that bridge either structurally distinct or ethnically distinct groups, has a significant, negative effect. Taken together, our results provide empirical support to widespread claims of the value of information access in common-pool resource systems, yet suggest that in ethnically diverse, competitive environments, brokers may be penalized for sharing information across social divides. Our results thus contribute to an emerging theory on the fragile nature of brokerage that recognizes its potential perils and the importance of context. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>What drives participatory policy processes: Grassroot activities, scientific knowledge or donor money? - A comparative policy network approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.03.001</url>
<snippet>A policy network approach has been developed to assess participatory policy processes in Ghana, Senegal, and Uganda. Theoretically, political influence measures correspond to two different influence mechanisms: vote buying and informational lobbying. For each mechanism, separate measures were defined and empirically derived from corresponding policy networks. Exponential random graph models were used to assess the network generating process, which allows for analysis of the robustness of the derived influence measures and the determinants of network structure. The results imply that participatory policy processes are dominated by donor and research organizations, while farm interests and civil society organizations have only a negligible influence. The design of stakeholder systems appears to be difficult since the observed network structures are mainly determined by relational factors that result from organizations' social networking activities or other organizational attributes, such as reputation power, which cannot be easily controlled. Institutional factors such as membership in committees have only a minor impact.

<title>Group differences in reciprocity, multiplexity and exchange: measures and application</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-011-9465-6</url>
<snippet>Local forces structure social networks. One major and widely researched local force is reciprocity, often assumed to work homogeneously across actors-i.e., all actors are equally subject to the same level of force towards reciprocity. Other local forces, like multiplexity and exchange, are also often assumed to apply equally to different actors. But social theory provides us with ample arguments why such forces might be stronger in some subsets of actors than others, or why such forces might affect intergroup ties more than intragroup ties. In this paper we introduce standard measures to capture these group specific forces towards reciprocity, multiplexity, and exchange. All the measures control for differential tendencies of actors to initiate ties of various types. We also introduce a procedure by which differences in the strength of these forces between groups and subgroups can be statistically evaluated.

<title>Assessing the relevance of node features for network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0811511106</url>
<snippet>Networks describe a variety of interacting complex systems in social science, biology, and information technology. Usually the nodes of real networks are identified not only by their connections but also by some other characteristics. Examples of characteristics of nodes can be age, gender, or nationality of a person in a social network, the abundance of proteins in the cell taking part in protein-interaction networks, or the geographical position of airports that are connected by directed flights. Integrating the information on the connections of each node with the information about its characteristics is crucial to discriminating between the essential and negligible characteristics of nodes for the structure of the network. In this paper we propose a general indicator T, based on entropy measures, to quantify the dependence of a network's structure on a given set of features. We apply this method to social networks of friendships in U. S. schools, to the protein-interaction network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to the U. S. airport network, showing that the proposed measure provides information that complements other known measures.

<title>The micro-foundations of elite politics: conversation networks and elite conflict during China's reform era</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11186-023-09530-7</url>
<snippet>In this article, we explore the micro-foundations of elite politics by focusing on changes in network structures that emerge from informal conversations. Empirically, we offer a novel "situational conflict" explanation to account for the puzzle of why reformist leaders were periodically ousted during China's reform era (1977-1992), emphasizing the unexpected power collision that catalyzed the violent crackdown on the Tiananmen movement in 1989. To do so, we employ network analysis and narrative to utilize an original dataset of elite conversations and primary sources that have only recently been made available. We find that ideological cleavage and manipulative brokerage produced each conflict to varying degrees but were contingent on the relational structure arising from elite conversational interactions. Furthermore, the actual unfolding of those conflicts often resulted from key actors' discrepant understandings of the changing relationships via ongoing interactions at vital moments, such as during the Tiananmen movement. Integrating micro-sociological theories and network analysis, our work has methodological and theoretical implications for unpacking the black box of elite politics and its role in macro-historical change.

<title>OPINION DIFFUSION ON MULTILAYER SOCIAL NETWORKS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219525917500151</url>
<snippet>In this paper, to reveal the influence of multilayer network structure on opinion diffusion in social networks, we study an opinion dynamics model based on DeGroot model on multilayer networks. We find that if the influence matrix integrating the information of connectedness for each layer and correlation between layers is strongly connected and aperiodic, all agents' opinions will reach a consensus. However, if there are stubborn agents in the networks, regular agents' opinions will finally be confined to the convex combinations of the stubborn agents'. Specifically, if all stubborn agents hold the same opinion, even if the agents only exist on a certain layer, their opinions will diffuse to the entire multilayer networks. This paper not only characterizes the influence of multilayer network topology and agent attribute on opinion diffusion in a holistic way, but also demonstrates the importance of coupling agents which play an indispensable role in some social and economic situations.

<title>Extent prediction of the information and influence propagation in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-020-09309-6</url>
<snippet>We present a new mathematical model that predicts the number of users informed and influenced by messages that are propagated in an online social network. Our model is based on a new way of quantifying the tie-strength, which in turn considers the affinity and relevance between nodes. We could verify that the messages to inform and influence, as well as their importance, produce different propagation behaviors in an online social network. We carried out laboratory tests with our model and with the baseline models Linear Threshold and Independent Cascade, which are currently used in many scientific works. The results were evaluated by comparing them with empirical data. The tests show conclusively that the predictions of our model are notably more accurate and precise than the predictions of the baseline models. Our model can contribute to the development of models that maximize the propagation of messages; to predict the spread of viruses in computer networks, mobile telephony and online social networks.

<title>WHEN INTUITION FAILS: THE COMPLEX EFFECTS OF ASSIMILATIVE AND REPULSIVE INFLUENCE ON OPINION POLARIZATION</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219525922500114</url>
<snippet>There is a public and scholarly debate about whether personalized services of social-media platforms contribute to the rise of bipolarization of political opinions. On the one hand, it is argued that personalized services of online social networks generate filter bubbles limiting contact between users who disagree. This reduces opportunities for assimilative social influence between users from different camps and prevents opinion convergence. On the other hand, empirical research also indicated that exposing users to content from the opposite political spectrum can activate the counter-part of assimilative influence, repulsive influence. Fostering contact that leads to opinion assimilation and limiting contacts likely to induce repulsive interactions, it has been concluded, may therefore prevent bipolarization. With an agent-based model, we demonstrate here that these conclusions fail to capture the complexity that assimilative and repulsive influence generate in social networks. Sometimes, more assimilative influence can actually lead to more and not less opinion bipolarization. Likewise, increasing the exposure of users to like-minded individuals sometimes intensifies opinion polarization. While emerging only in specific parts of the parameter space, these counter-intuitive dynamics are robust, as our simulation experiments demonstrate. We discuss implications for the debate about filter bubbles and approaches to improve the design of online social networks. While we applaud the growing empirical research on the micro-processes of assimilative and repulsive influence in online settings, we warn that drawing conclusions about resulting macro-outcomes like opinion bipolarization requires a rigorous analysis capturing the complexity of online communication systems. Intuition alone is error-prone in this context. Accordingly, models capturing the complexity of social influence in networks should play a more important role in the design of communication systems.

<title>Friendship Network and Dental Brushing Behavior among Middle School Students: An Agent Based Modeling Approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169236</url>
<snippet>By using a standard questionnaire, the level of dental brushing frequency was assessed among 201 adolescent female middle school students in Tehran. The initial assessment was repeated after 5 months, in order to observe the dynamics in dental health behavior level. Logistic Regression model was used to evaluate the correlation among individuals' dental health behavior in their social network. A significant correlation on dental brushing habits was detected among groups of friends. This correlation was further spread over the network within the 5 months period. Moreover, it was identified that the average brushing level was improved within the 5 months period. Given that there was a significant correlation between social network's nodes' in-degree value, and brushing level, it was suggested that the observed improvement was partially due to more popularity of individuals with better tooth brushing habit. Agent Based Modeling (ABM) was used to demonstrate the dynamics of dental brushing frequency within a sample of friendship network. Two models with static and dynamic assumptions for the network structure were proposed. The model with dynamic network structure successfully described the dynamics of dental health behavior. Based on this model, on average, every 43 weeks a student changes her brushing habit due to learning from her friends. Finally, three training scenarios were tested by these models in order to evaluate their effectiveness. When training more popular students, considerable improvement in total students' brushing frequency was demonstrated by simulation results.

<title>The statistical evaluation of social network dynamics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/0081-1750.00099</url>
<snippet>A class of statistical models is proposed for longitudinal network data. The dependent variable is the changing (or evolving) relation network, represented by two or more observations of a directed graph with a fixed set of actors. The network evolution is modeled as the consequence of the actors making new choices, or withdrawing existing choices, on the basis of functions, with fixed and random components, that the actors try to maximize. Individual and dyadic exogenous variables can be used as covariates. The change in the network is modeled as the stochastic result of network effects (reciprocity, transitivity, etc.) and these covariates. The existing network structure is a dynamic constraint for the evolution of the structure itself. The models are continuous-time Markov chain models that can be implemented as simulation models. The model parameters are estimated from observed data. For estimating and testing these models, statistical procedures are proposed that are based on the method of moments. The statistical procedures are implemented using a stochastic approximation algorithm based on computer simulations of the network evolution process.

<title>Non-parametric estimation of reciprocity and triadic effects in relational event networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.08.004</url>
<snippet>Relational event networks arise naturally from social interactions: interactions can be considered time-stamped edges between vertices of social actors. By studying the factors that influence the interaction inter-arrival times we can get insight in the drivers of interaction dynamics. Relational event models provide a succinct way to analyse a broad family of interactional patterns and their influence on network dynamics. These models can easily incorporate a wide range of mechanisms involving both endogenous and exogenous network effects. It has been typical for quantitive models to assume that endogenous network mechanisms, such as reciprocity or triadic effects, remain stable over time. However, a number of studies argued that reciprocity has a strong tendency to decay over time. This paper proposes to model the dynamic structure of reciprocal and triadic effects in relational event networks via stratified baseline hazards. This avoids having to define arbitrary temporal windows for what can be considered reciprocity or triadic closure. A two-step estimation framework is used, based on the stratified Cox proportional hazards model, followed by non-parametric estimation of the stratified cumulative hazard functions. This framework is illustrated by a simulation study and its application to two studies involving email communication and classroom interactions.

<title>Network Effects and Social Inequality</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102545</url>
<snippet>Students of social inequality have noted the presence of mechanisms militating toward cumulative advantage and increasing inequality. Social scientists have established that individuals' choices are influenced by those of their network peers in many social domains. We suggest that the ubiquity of network effects and tendencies toward cumulative advantage are related. Inequality is exacerbated when effects of individual differences are multiplied by social networks: when persons must decide whether to adopt beneficial practices; when network externalities, social learning, or normative pressures influence adoption decisions; and when networks are homophilous with respect to individual characteristics that predict such decisions. We review evidence from literatures on network effects on technology, labor markets, education, demography, and health; identify several mechanisms through which networks may generate higher levels of inequality than one would expect based on differences in initial endowments alone; consider cases in which network effects may ameliorate inequality; and describe research priorities.

<title>Multiplexity as a lens to investigate the cultural meanings of interpersonal ties</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.07.002</url>
<snippet>A typical assumption in formal studies of social networks is that interpersonal ties classified under the same label carry the same cultural connotation. As cultural meanings matter for the construction of ties, this premise can be problematic when labels attributed to relationships sustain the simultaneous coexistence of disparate meanings. I argue that the measurement and analysis of multiplexity is a useful tool for testing the validity of this assumption and exploring the cultural meanings of ties using traditional survey data. Employing loglinear models and a datamining technique called 'association rules', I analyze data from the 2004 social networks component of the General Social Survey, which gave subjects the option to classify confidants into multiple relational categories. Contrary to standard assumptions, I find that, subjects report viewing their ties multiplexly a little less than half the time. Familial labels are either perceived as intrinsically meaningful or more broadly as 'friends' and 'advisors.' Spouses are likely to be described as 'friends' only when they are also classified as 'coworkers' or 'group members.' 'Friend' and 'advisor' also display complex layering alongside other labels indicative of flexibility. I discuss implications of my findings for network structure and the cultural meanings of close personal ties.

<title>Susceptibility to social influence predicts behavior on Facebook</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229337</url>
<snippet>Susceptibility to social influence (SSI) has been reported as a key factor for social influence in online social networks (OSNs) such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. In four online studies, we show that the personality trait of SSI, namely the susceptibility to normative influence (SNI), predicts the extent to which Facebook users comply with the behavior of others on Facebook (e.g., buying, voting, or visiting what other OSN users post). In Studies 1a and 1b, we find that SSI correlates with diverse OSN behaviors, which are the typical results of being affected by social influence. In Study 1b, we find that the perceived importance of the topic of OSN behaviors (e.g., fashion or politics) moderates the effect of SNI on OSN behavior, with a higher importance resulting in a stronger effect of SNI on OSN behavior. In Studies 2 and 3, we find that SNI predicts the extent Facebook users hypothetically "like" diverse topics on Facebook. We also find partial support for the idea that there are interactions between SNI and the Big Five personality traits (i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) on OSN behavior. Specifically, the extent to which the Big Five personality traits of openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism predict OSN behavior depends on Facebook users' SNI. Our studies contribute to research on the personality-based prediction of OSN behavior and help in better understanding the dynamics of social influence in OSNs, underlining the vulnerability of susceptible OSN users.

<title>Why does everybody hate me? Balance, status, and homophily: The triumvirate of signed tie formation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.08.002</url>
<snippet>Despite being one of the foundational theories of signed (positive/negative) tie formation, the evidence for balance theory is far from conclusive. A recent promising alternative is status theory, but a theoretical and explanatory gap still remains, with a dearth of theories and evidence. We put forward and test eight separate theories of signed tie formation on two face-to-face networks of friendship and esteem of 282 students. We use dimension reduction (factor analysis) on the results tables comparing the predictions of these eight theories for 50 ERGM parameters with our estimated models. We find three main paradigms explain the majority of signed network formation: balance, status, and homophily.

<title>Fighting fake news in the COVID-19 era: policy insights from an equilibrium model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11077-020-09405-z</url>
<snippet>The COVID-19 crisis has revealed structural failures in governance and coordination on a global scale. With related policy interventions dependent on verifiable evidence, pandemics require governments to not only consider the input of experts but also ensure that science is translated for public understanding. However, misinformation and fake news, including content shared through social media, compromise the efficacy of evidence-based policy interventions and undermine the credibility of scientific expertise with potentially longer-term consequences. We introduce a formal mathematical model to understand factors influencing the behavior of social media users when encountering fake news. The model illustrates that direct efforts by social media platforms and governments, along with informal pressure from social networks, can reduce the likelihood that users who encounter fake news embrace and further circulate it. This study has implications at a practical level for crisis response in politically fractious settings and at a theoretical level for research about post-truth and the construction of fact.

<title>Assessment of network structure characteristics and factors of corporate flows in Guangdong Province</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0293870</url>
<snippet>With the rapid development of the world city network, the traditional location theory has gradually been disproven, and the advantages of the flow space over the traditional vertical organizational structure are gradually being revealed. Therefore, from corporate branch networks and corporate investment networks, 21 cities in urban agglomerations of Guangdong are taken as case studies for this paper. Furthermore, in this paper, 5 representative types of corporate contact data (catering service, financial service, life service, sports and leisure and accommodation service) are selected, the social network analysis (SNA) method is used to quantitatively analyze the network structure characteristics of urban agglomerations, and a spatial interaction model is constructed to explore the factors influencing. The results indicate that secondary networks have developed in Guangdong. The financial service network is the most complex, followed by the life services, sports and leisure and catering networks. The accommodation service network structure is the simplest. Among all kinds of networks, Guangzhou and Shenzhen have the highest status. The catering and accommodation corporations in Yangjiang in the west have a relatively major external development. Shantou in the east has many branches of various types, while most of the capital exchange in the region is concentrated in Heyuan and Qingyuan in the north. The coefficients of geographical proximity and the urban development level play a significant role in promoting the development of networks. However, administrative capacity limits the attractiveness of origin cities to a certain extent.

<title>Structural centrality in fuzzy social networks based on fuzzy hypergraph theory</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-020-09312-x</url>
<snippet>The knowledge of key network members is generally known to be critical to fuzzy social network analysis. Thus far, most studies aiming to identify critical members have taken network structural centrality measures. Since fuzzy graph cannot effectively depict the multidimensional relationships between the nodes of fuzzy social networks, a fuzzy social network model is developed complying with a mathematical theory of fuzzy hypergraph, allowing fuzzy social network to be represented more intuitively and visually. A fuzzy hypergraph model of fuzzy social network refers to a structure, vertex set acts as an object set, and the fuzzy relation in fuzzy relation structure is expressed by membership function and fuzzy relation matrix. With the fuzzy hypergraph model of fuzzy social networks, the definitions of structural centrality are given (i.e., degree centrality, relative degree centrality, closeness centrality, relative closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and relative betweenness centrality). Lastly, by analyzing examples, the process of building fuzzy social network with fuzzy hypergraph and the calculation method of centrality are illustrated.

<title>Identities in flux: Cognitive network activation in times of change</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.01.001</url>
<snippet>Using a dynamic cognitive model, we experimentally test two competing hypotheses that link identity and cognitive network activation during times of change. On one hand, affirming people's sense of power might give them confidence to think beyond the densest subsections of their social networks. Alternatively, if such power affirmations conflict with people's more stable status characteristics, this could create tension, deterring people from considering their networks' diversity. We test these competing hypotheses experimentally by priming people at varying levels of status with power (high/low) and asking them to report their social networks. We show that confirming identity-not affirming power-cognitively prepares people to broaden their social networks when the world is changing around them. The emotional signature of having a confirmed identity is feeling comfortable and in control, which mediates network activation. We suggest that stable, confirmed identities are the foundation from which people can exhibit greater network responsiveness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<title>Cultural selection shapes network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaw0609</url>
<snippet>Cultural evolution relies on the social transmission of cultural traits along a population's social network. Research indicates that network structure affects information spread and thus the capacity for cumulative culture. However, how network structure itself is driven by population-culture co-evolution remains largely unclear. We use a simple model to investigate how populations negotiate the trade-off between acquiring new skills and getting better at existing skills and how this trade-off shapes social networks. We find unexpected eco-evolutionary feedbacks from culture onto social networks and vice versa. We show that selecting for skill generalists results in sparse networks with diverse skill sets, whereas selecting for skill specialists results in dense networks and a population that specializes on the same few skills on which everyone is an expert. Our model advances our understanding of the complex feedbacks in cultural evolution and demonstrates how individual-level behavior can lead to the emergence of population-level structure.

<title>How Network Externalities Can Exacerbate Intergroup Inequality</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/659653</url>
<snippet>The authors describe a common but largely unrecognized mechanism that produces and exacerbates intergroup inequality: the diffusion of valuable practices with positive network externalities through social networks whose members differentially possess characteristics associated with adoption. The authors examine two cases: the first, to explore the mechanism's implications and, the second, to demonstrate its utility in analyzing empirical data. In the first, the diffusion of Internet use, network effects increase adoption's benefits to associates of prior adopters. An agent-based model demonstrates positive, monotonic relationships, given externalities, between homophily bias and intergroup inequality in equilibrium adoption rates. In the second, rural-urban migration in Thailand, network effects reduce risk to persons whose networks include prior migrants. Analysis of longitudinal individual-level migration data indicates that network homophily interacts with network externalities to induce divergence of migration rates among otherwise similar villages.

<title>Informal Water Tankers, Their Network Structure, and Drivers of Cooperation and Competition: A Case Study in Beirut, Lebanon</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2023.2246028</url>
<snippet>Areas with chronic water shortages rely on informal water tankers for daily water needs. Informal tankers operate outside the reach of the state, hence the quality and price of the services they provide and the pressure their activities inflict on water systems go largely unchecked. Informal tankers use their social relationships to manage water sources and operate like an informal network. Yet, little is known about the drivers that explain their relationships and their impact on the overall water system. We investigate these issues in the empirical case of Beirut (Lebanon) using 20 semi-structured interviews and social network analysis. We find that: cooperative and competitive relationships between tankers give rise to different network structures; the drivers of cooperation and competition are religion and seniority in the market; climate change affects informal water markets by increasing competition for wells and clients. We propose recommendations for practitioners and policy-makers, and future research.

<title>An Urban Network Study of Government Procurement Activities: A Case Study of Northeast China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/8819441</url>
<snippet>Urban networks have been widely examined using infrastructure connection and firm connection data. In particular, urban networks constructed based on firm connection data have been used to depict the circulation of capital, information, personnel, and products between cities. Existing studies on firm connection networks rely on either inter- or intrafirm relationships. However, there exist various important extra-firm relationships, such as those between firms and governments, research institutions, and nonprofit organizations. This study innovatively incorporates the extra-firm relationships between governments and firms into urban network construction to provide new insights into the field of urban network research. Using Northeast China as a case study, we construct government procurement activity (GPA) connection networks for both central projects and local projects at the regional and national scales. Social network analysis and regression analysis are used to analyze the network characteristics and factors associated with the network structure. The results show that three provincial capitals (Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang) hold dominant positions across all the networks. While these capitals serve as GPA suppliers in the region, they are mainly GPA consumers nationally. The factors of spatial proximity, economic development, population, and provincial boundaries were found to be significantly associated with GPA connections. Our study provides important insights into the role of cities in firm-government supply-demand networks. This research can be used to help formulate effective strategies to improve a city's competitiveness and cities' cooperation in the GPA supply-demand network.

<title>Networks, Percolation, and Consumer Demand</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3658</url>
<snippet>Understanding diffusion processes is key to market strategies as well as innovation and sustainability policies. In promoting new products and technologies, firms and governments need to understand the conditions favouring successful spread of these products. We propose a generic diffiusion model based on percolation theory. Our reference is a new product diffusion in a social network through word-of-mouth. Given that consumers differ in their reservation prices, a critical price exists that defines a phase transition froma no-diffusion to a diffusion regime. As consumer surplus is maximised just below a product's critical price, one can systematically compare the economic efficiency of network structures by investigating their critical price. Networks with lowclustering were themost efficient, because clustering leads to redundant information flows hampering effective product diffusion. We further showed that the more equal a society, the more efficient the diffusion process.

<title>The Dichotomy between Providing Services and Supporting Social Inclusion in the Network of Third Sector Social Service Organisations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.5477/cis/reis.178.83</url>
<snippet>Inter-organisational collaboration plays an important role in the provision of services by the third sector. In this article we analyse the relationships among 21 third sector organisations in Andalusia. Through social network analysis we evaluate centrality, cohesion, influence and brokerage in different relationship structures among these organizations. The results reveal the existence of two relational spheres: one consisting of third sector organisations that provide services to specific groups and the other of organisations that work on issues of social inclusion and participation. A limited number entities account for the majority of the relationship activities in the network, mediating between users, the third sector and public administration. These entities structure the relationships into clusters with high cohesion, facilitating control over resources and the convergence of objectives among organisations in the same sphere.

<title>Spatial-Temporal Dynamics of High-Resolution Animal Networks: What Can We Learn from Domestic Animals?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0129253</url>
<snippet>Animal social network is the key to understand many ecological and epidemiological processes. We used real-time location system(RTLS) to accurately track cattle position, analyze their proximity networks, and tested the hypothesis of temporal stationarity and spatial homogeneity in these networks during different daily time periods and in different areas of the pen. The network structure was analyzed using global network characteristics (network density), subgroup clustering (modularity), triadic property (transitivity), and dyadic interactions (correlation coefficient from a quadratic assignment procedure) at hourly level. We demonstrated substantial spatial-temporal heterogeneity in these networks and potential link between indirect animal-environment contact and direct animal-animal contact. But such heterogeneity diminished if data were collected at lower spatial (aggregated at entire pen level) or temporal (aggregated at daily level) resolution. The network structure (described by the characteristics such as density, modularity, transitivity, etc.) also changed substantially at different time and locations. There were certain time (feeding) and location (hay) that the proximity network structures were more consistent based on the dyadic interaction analysis. These results reveal new insights for animal network structure and spatial-temporal dynamics, provide more accurate descriptions of animal social networks, and allow more accurate modeling of multiple (both direct and indirect) disease transmission pathways.

<title>The effect of individual variation on the structure and function of interaction networks in harvester ants</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2011.0059</url>
<snippet>Social insects exhibit coordinated behaviour without central control. Local interactions among individuals determine their behaviour and regulate the activity of the colony. Harvester ants are recruited for outside work, using networks of brief antennal contacts, in the nest chamber closest to the nest exit: the entrance chamber. Here, we combine empirical observations, image analysis and computer simulations to investigate the structure and function of the interaction network in the entrance chamber. Ant interactions were distributed heterogeneously in the chamber, with an interaction hot-spot at the entrance leading further into the nest. The distribution of the total interactions per ant followed a right-skewed distribution, indicating the presence of highly connected individuals. Numbers of ant encounters observed positively correlated with the duration of observation. Individuals varied in interaction frequency, even after accounting for the duration of observation. An ant's interaction frequency was explained by its path shape and location within the entrance chamber. Computer simulations demonstrate that variation among individuals in connectivity accelerates information flow to an extent equivalent to an increase in the total number of interactions. Individual variation in connectivity, arising from variation among ants in location and spatial behaviour, creates interaction centres, which may expedite information flow.

<title>Do I Deserve to Spend? Online Social Support and Spending Pleasure</title>

<snippet>Despite evidence of people posting their consumption experiences to online social networks to fulfill the needs of social support, an understanding of how online social support affects post-consumption spending behaviors remains elusive. This research aims to examine how online social support from online social network friends and the firm influence perceptions of self-deservingness and spending pleasure. Across two studies, this research provides evidence that social support gained through online social networks influences consumers' spending pleasure through perceptions of their own deservingness. Notably, this study reveals that people obtain social support in online social networks from two sources: social networks friends and firms through receiving "Likes" and "Comments" on their post. This study also explores boundary conditions for when online social support is more effective on spending pleasure. The findings not only broaden the social support literature but also address the benefit to the service industry by understanding how social support can enhance spending pleasure.

<title>Impact of methods for reducing respondent burden on personal network structural measures</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2006.12.005</url>
<snippet>We examine methods for reducing respondent burden in evaluating alter-alter ties on a set of network structural measures. The data consist of two sets, each containing 45 alters from respondent free lists: the first contains 447 personal networks, and the second 554. Respondents evaluated the communication between 990 alter pairs. The methods were (1) dropping alters from the end of the free-list, (2) randomly dropping alters, (3) randomly dropping links, and (4) predicting ties based on transitivity. For some measures network structure is captured with samples of less than 20 alters; other measures are less consistent. Researchers should be aware of the need to sample a minimum number of alters to capture structural variation.

<title>How the online social networks are used: dialogues-based structure of MySpace</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2012.0819</url>
<snippet>Quantitative study of collective dynamics in online social networks is a new challenge based on the abundance of empirical data. Conclusions, however, may depend on factors such as user's psychology profiles and their reasons to use the online contacts. In this study, we have compiled and analysed two datasets from MySpace. The data contain networked dialogues occurring within a specified time depth, high temporal resolution and texts of messages, in which the emotion valence is assessed by using the SentiStrength classifier. Performing a comprehensive analysis, we obtain three groups of results: dynamic topology of the dialogues-based networks have a characteristic structure with Zipf's distribution of communities, low link reciprocity and disassortative correlations. Overlaps supporting 'weak-ties' hypothesis are found to follow the laws recently conjectured for online games. Long-range temporal correlations and persistent fluctuations occur in the time series of messages carrying positive (negative) emotion; patterns of user communications have dominant positive emotion (attractiveness) and strong impact of circadian cycles and interactivity times longer than 1 day. Taken together, these results give a new insight into the functioning of online social networks and unveil the importance of the amount of information and emotion that is communicated along the social links. All data used in this study are fully anonymized.

<title>The Social Origins of Networks and Diffusion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/681275</url>
<snippet>Recent research on social contagion has demonstrated significant effects of network topology on the dynamics of diffusion. However, network topologies are not given a priori. Rather, they are patterns of relations that emerge from individual and structural features of society, such as population composition, group heterogeneity, homophily, and social consolidation. Following Blau and Schwartz, the author develops a model of social network formation that explores how social and structural constraints on tie formation generate emergent social topologies and then explores the effectiveness of these social networks for the dynamics of social diffusion. Results show that, at one extreme, high levels of consolidation can create highly balkanized communities with poor integration of shared norms and practices. As suggested by Blau and Schwartz, reducing consolidation creates more crosscutting circles and significantly improves the dynamics of social diffusion across the population. However, the author finds that further reducing consolidation creates highly intersecting social networks that fail to support the widespread diffusion of norms and practices, indicating that successful social diffusion can depend on moderate to high levels of structural consolidation.

<title>Young People's Uses and Understandings of Online Social Networks in Their Everyday Lives</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1103308813477463</url>
<snippet>This article examines young people's uses and understandings of social networking sites and instant messaging tools within the context of their everyday lives. It draws upon data from the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)-funded qualitative study, 'Young people's creative understanding of their mediaworlds' (2008-10), in which young people aged 14-15 from six locations across England created 'identity boxes' which were meant to reflect their identities and the place of media in their lives. The results demonstrate that young people considered and negotiated their online practices in relation to three primary areas: 'Connecting and convenience', 'Openness and control' and 'Privacy and authenticity'. In doing so the article reveals nuanced insights into young people's online media use and communication, and contributes empirically to knowledge about young people's online practices within their everyday lives.

<title>How intermittent breaks in interaction improve collective intelligence</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802407115</url>
<snippet>People influence each other when they interact to solve problems. Such social influence introduces both benefits (higher average solution quality due to exploitation of existing answers through social learning) and costs (lower maximum solution quality due to a reduction in individual exploration for novel answers) relative to independent problem solving. In contrast to prior work, which has focused on how the presence and network structure of social influence affect performance, here we investigate the effects of time. We show that when social influence is intermittent it provides the benefits of constant social influence without the costs. Human subjects solved the canonical traveling salesperson problem in groups of three, randomized into treatments with constant social influence, intermittent social influence, or no social influence. Groups in the intermittent social-influence treatment found the optimum solution frequently (like groups without influence) but had a high mean performance (like groups with constant influence); they learned from each other, while maintaining a high level of exploration. Solutions improved most on rounds with social influence after a period of separation. We also show that storing subjects' best solutions so that they could be reloaded and possibly modified in subsequent rounds-a ubiquitous feature of personal productivity software-is similar to constant social influence: It increases mean performance but decreases exploration.

<title>Structural estimation of pairwise stable networks with nonnegative externality</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.08.001</url>
<snippet>This paper develops a framework to structurally estimate pairwise stable networks with nonnegative externality. We characterize pairwise stable equilibria as a fixed point of a certain mapping and show that the set of pairwise stable equilibria with nonnegative externality is a complete lattice. We extend the characterization to an econometric framework for structural estimation based on the moment inequality model. We apply our methodology to friendship networks of students in the United States, using data from Add-Health. We find that the preference toward racial homophily is overestimated if we do not control for the preference toward clustering. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>A framework for detecting unfolding emergencies using humans as sensors</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-1674-y</url>
<snippet>The advent of online social networks (OSNs) paired with the ubiquitous proliferation of smartphones have enabled social sensing systems. In the last few years, the aptitude of humans to spontaneously collect and timely share context information has been exploited for emergency detection and crisis management. Apart from event-specific features, these systems share technical approaches and architectural solutions to address the issues with capturing, filtering and extracting meaningful information from data posted to OSNs by networks of human sensors. This paper proposes a conceptual and architectural framework for the design of emergency detection systems based on the "human as a sensor" (HaaS) paradigm. An ontology for the HaaS paradigm in the context of emergency detection is defined. Then, a modular architecture, independent of a specific emergency type, is designed. The proposed architecture is demonstrated by an implemented application for detecting earthquakes via Twitter. Validation and experimental results based on messages posted during earthquakes occurred in Italy are reported.

<title>Collective Action and the Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: The Case of the Panama Papers Protest in Iceland</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcab051</url>
<snippet>Social theory implies that a rise in the expectation that many will participate in collective action can make participation in the action widely rational, giving rise to a 'self-fulfilling prophecy'. I address this classic, yet understudied, proposition by surveying participation in a demonstration that the 'Panama Papers Leak' triggered in Iceland in 2016. The demonstration was preceded by a sudden rise of large-turnout expectations, and attracted one-fifth of an urban population, allowing me to obtain event-specific, population-representative survey measures of the focal constructs (N = 821). The findings support hypotheses about the role of large-turnout expectations in collective action. They confirm that protest support (i.e. the value placed in the goal of the collective action) both raises large-turnout expectations and moderates their effects on protest participation. In fact, large-turnout expectations were associated with participation only if individuals supported the protest. Also, the findings imply that large-protest expectations trigger interpersonal relational dynamics that further motivate participation. The study thus supports and yet qualifies the role of the self-fulfilling prophecy in collective action.

<title>Information Spreading on Weighted Multiplex Social Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/5920187</url>
<snippet>Information spreading on multiplex networks has been investigated widely. For multiplex networks, the relations of each layer possess different extents of intimacy, which can be described as weighted multiplex networks. Nevertheless, the effect of weighted multiplex network structures on information spreading has not been analyzed comprehensively. We herein propose an information spreading model on a weighted multiplex network. Then, we develop an edge-weight-based compartmental theory to describe the spreading dynamics. We discover that under any adoption threshold of two subnetworks, reducing weight distribution heterogeneity does not alter the growth pattern of the final adoption size versus information transmission probability while accelerating information spreading. For fixed weight distribution, the growth pattern changes with the heterogeneous of degree distribution. There is a critical initial seed size, below which no global information outbreak can occur. Extensive numerical simulations affirm that the theoretical predictions agree well with the numerical results.

<title>Can Geographical Factors Determine the Choices of Farmers in the Ethiopian Highlands to Trade in Livestock Markets?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0030710</url>
<snippet>Proximity and affiliation to the local market appear to be two of the most relevant factors to explain farmer's choices to select a particular trading point. Physical barriers may limit the options, especially in developing countries. A network of villages linked by traders/farmer-traders sharing livestock markets was built with field data collected in 75 villages from 8 kebelles in the Wassona Werna wereda of the Ethiopian Highlands. Two exponential random graph models were fitted with various geographical and demographic attributes of the nodes (dyadic independent model) and three internal network structures (dyadic dependent model). Several diagnostic methods were applied to assess the goodness of fit of the models. The odds of an edge where the distance to the main market Debre Behran and the difference in altitude between two connected villages are both large increases significantly so that villages far away from the main market and at different altitude are more likely to be linked in the network than randomly. The odds of forming an edge between two villages in Abamote or Gudoberet kebelles are approximately 75&#37; lower than an edge between villages in any other kebelles (p&lt;0.05). The conditional log-odds of two villages forming a tie that is not included in a triangle, a 2-star or a 3-star is extremely low, increasing the odds significantly (p&lt;0.05) each time a node is in a 2-star structure and decreasing it when a node is in a 3-star (p&lt;0.05) or in a triangle formation (p&lt;0.05)), conditional on the rest of the network. Two major constraining factors, namely distance and altitude, are not deterrent for the potential contact of susceptible small ruminant populations in the Highlands of Ethiopia.

<title>An efficient counting method for the colored triad census</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.04.003</url>
<snippet>The triad census is an important approach to understand local structure in network science, providing comprehensive assessments of the observed relational configurations between triples of actors in a network. However, researchers are often interested in combinations of relational and categorical nodal attributes. In this case, it is desirable to account for the label, or color, of the nodes in the triad census. In this paper, we describe an efficient algorithm for constructing the colored triad census, based, in part, on existing methods for the classic triad census. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm using empirical and simulated data for both undirected and directed graphs. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces computational time by approximately many-fold over the naive approach. We also apply the colored triad census to the Zachary karate club network dataset. We simultaneously show the efficiency of the algorithm, and a way to conduct a statistical test on the census by forming a null distribution from 1000 realizations of a mixing matrix conditioned graph and comparing the observed colored triad counts to the expected. From this, we demonstrate the method's utility in our discussion of results about homophily, heterophily, and bridging, simultaneously gained via the colored triad census. In sum, the proposed algorithm for the colored triad census brings novel utility to social network analysis in an efficient package.

<title>Spatiotemporal network structure among "friends of friends" reveals contagious disease process</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237168</url>
<snippet>Disease transmission can be identified in a social network from the structural patterns of contact. However, it is difficult to separate contagious processes from those driven by homophily, and multiple pathways of transmission or inexact information on the timing of infection can obscure the detection of true transmission events. Here, we analyze the dynamic social network of a large, and near-complete population of 16,430 zoo birds tracked daily over 22 years to test a novel "friends-of-friends" strategy for detecting contagion in a social network. The results show that cases of avian mycobacteriosis were significantly clustered among pairs of birds that had been in direct contact. However, since these clusters might result due to correlated traits or a shared environment, we also analyzed pairs of birds that had never been in direct contact but were indirectly connected in the network via other birds. The disease was also significantly clustered among these friends of friends and a reverse-time placebo test shows that homophily could not be causing the clustering. These results provide empirical evidence that at least some avian mycobacteriosis infections are transmitted between birds, and provide new methods for detecting contagious processes in large-scale global network structures with indirect contacts, even when transmission pathways, timing of cases, or etiologic agents are unknown.

<title>The emergence of complex adaptive response networks in China: A case study of four disasters</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/risa.14121</url>
<snippet>This study aims to identify the driving forces behind interorganizational networks in China following disasters. Using the theory of complex adaptive systems, we identified the self-organization process of disaster response as the network formation process. We identified interorganizational networks that emerged in response to two natural hazards and two technical disasters by collecting data from multiple sources. The exponential random model analysis is performed to analyze the effects of structures and organizational attributes on network formation. In structuring networks for disaster response, findings demonstrate that bonding structures take precedence over bridging structures for organizations. Meanwhile, the sector and jurisdiction-based homophily effects facilitate network formation in disaster response. On the basis of research findings, five propositions describing the network formation process in China's disaster response are proposed. Such a theoretical model is essential for advancing research and practice in complex disaster network management.

<title>Crisis Communications in the Age of Social Media: A Network Analysis of Zika-Related Tweets</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439317721985</url>
<snippet>While emerging technologies such as social media have demonstrated value for crisis communications, significant question remains regarding how these tools can be most effectively leveraged to facilitate the flow of valid information under crisis conditions. In an effort to address these issues, this article examines the use of Twitter during the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak in the United States. Particular attention is paid to network structures within the Zika conversation and how different actors and communities contribute to the flow of information throughout the broader Twitter community. Public-facing organizations can benefit from a deeper understanding of the nature and structure of spontaneously occurring communities on social media as well as the types of content that they create and circulate. As such, these findings have significant implications for the development of effective social media strategies during natural disasters and public health emergencies. In particular, this analysis identifies several predominant themes communicated through Zika-related tweets as well as a number of distinct communities and influential actors. The findings suggest that respected political actors, public institutions, as well as those with valid scientific credentials can help to facilitate the flow of accurate and vital information across disparate communities.

<title>Social networks and environmental outcomes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1523245113</url>
<snippet>Social networks can profoundly affect human behavior, which is the primary force driving environmental change. However, empirical evidence linking microlevel social interactions to large-scale environmental outcomes has remained scarce. Here, we leverage comprehensive data on information-sharing networks among large-scale commercial tuna fishers to examine how social networks relate to shark bycatch, a global environmental issue. We demonstrate that the tendency for fishers to primarily share information within their ethnic group creates segregated networks that are strongly correlated with shark bycatch. However, some fishers share information across ethnic lines, and examinations of their bycatch rates show that network contacts are more strongly related to fishing behaviors than ethnicity. Our findings indicate that social networks are tied to actions that can directly impact marine ecosystems, and that biases toward within-group ties may impede the diffusion of sustainable behaviors. Importantly, our analysis suggests that enhanced communication channels across segregated fisher groups could have prevented the incidental catch of over 46,000 sharks between 2008 and 2012 in a single commercial fishery.

<title>Cultural identity change in expatriates: A social network perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0018726714561699</url>
<snippet>We explore relational patterns of expatriates' social networks and their impact on expatriates' change in cultural identity while working abroad. We go beyond mono-cultural assumptions and highlight the importance of examining cross-cultural relational dynamics on maintenance and change in expatriates' cultural identity. We argue that strong ties in dense networks are most conducive to helping expatriates stay attached to a national culture. Cultural diversity in a social network provides the impetus for cultural identity change. Cross-cultural interconnectedness within an expatriate's social network contributes to the development of multiculturalism in one's cultural identity. We also discuss the effect of cultural identity change on expatriation and repatriation adjustment, and provide some practical implications for individuals as well as organizations. Overall, we offer a cross-cultural social network perspective in theorizing about the expatriation experience.

<title>NETWORKS OF ELITE STRUCTURE AND DECISION-MAKING</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0049124193022001002</url>
<snippet>Recent research on community power structures and national political elites increasingly incorporates social network concepts, principles, and methodologies. Analysts using this perspective seek to uncover the various mechanisms underlying the cleavages and coalitions among state managers, political parties, corporations, interest groups, social movements, mass publics, class segments, and other social formations. By combining reputational, positional, and decision-making measures, researchers delineate the networks of communication ties and resource exchanges, which shape collective actions that attempt to influence the outcomes of political controversies. This article critically reviews recent power structure research that applies network techniques to the analysis of elite structures and decision making. Specifically, the following topics are examined. the specification of political network content, the delineation of political elite system boundaries, the identification of key or core actors, the representation of network structures, elite actors' individual and collective participation in policy events, the determination of policy event outcomes, and future directions for elite research using network perspectives.

<title>The switching mechanisms of social network densification</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82432-9</url>
<snippet>Densification and sparsification of social networks are attributed to two fundamental mechanisms: a change in the population in the system, and/or a change in the chances that people in the system are connected. In theory, each of these mechanisms generates a distinctive type of densification scaling, but in reality both types are generally mixed. Here, we develop a Bayesian statistical method to identify the extent to which each of these mechanisms is at play at a given point in time, taking the mixed densification scaling as input. We apply the method to networks of face-to-face interactions of individuals and reveal that the main mechanism that causes densification and sparsification occasionally switches, the frequency of which depending on the social context. The proposed method uncovers an inherent regime-switching property of network dynamics, which will provide a new insight into the mechanics behind evolving social interactions.

<title>What drives the adoption of climate change mitigation policy? A dynamic network approach to policy diffusion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11077-018-9332-6</url>
<snippet>The requirement of bottom-up action from all the countries to deal with climate change makes it necessary to analyze the factors influencing policy adoption. This article contributes to the policy literature by shedding light on the conditions, which incentivize countries to adopt more climate mitigation policies. The theoretical argument builds on the integrated approaches to study policy diffusion, which include both internal and external determinants as explanations for the adoption of policies. While previous applications typically operationalize the latter by regional proximity, this study highlights the added value of network dependencies capturing political and cooperative interactions across countries. The article finds that the adoption of climate policies is a matter of social influence. Countries are more likely to adopt policies if they cooperate with countries that have adopted more climate policies and are in a similar structural position to countries that are active in climate protection. This article not only is an important theoretical contribution to the policy literature but also enriches our methodological and empirical understanding of climate policy diffusion.

<snippet>Although there is a large literature on social capital, empirical estimates of the effect of social capital may be biased because of social homophily, the tendency of similar people to become friends with each other. Despite the methodological difficulties, a recent literature has emerged across several different disciplines that tries to estimate the causal effect of social capital. This paper reviews this recent empirical literature on social capital, paying close attention to the statistical and theoretical assumptions involved. Overall, there is evidence that genuine progress has been made in estimating the effect of social capital. The reviewed articles should provide useful examples for future research.

<title>Research on opinion polarization by big data analytics capabilities in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.101902</url>
<snippet>Opinion polarization in online social networks causes a lot of concerns on its social, economic, and political impacts, and is becoming an important topic for academic research. Based on the system theory, a theoretical framework on analyzing opinion polarization combining big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) is proposed. A web crawler is used to collect data from the Sina Weibo platform on the topic of "Tangping". Concerning the characteristics of the big data environment, social network analysis (SNA), machine learning, text clustering and content analysis are used to mine opinion polarization of "Tangping" on Weibo. Results show that social network users holding the same opinion indicate the phenomenon of aggregation. Although no influential users support the opinion of "Tangping" on Weibo, a high percentage of people advocate the idea. The supporting group has the most clusters while the opposing group has the highest density of keywords. The research contributes to the existing literature on applying BDAC to analyze online polarization from the perspective of the system from user behavior and interaction to topic clustering and keywords identification. The conceptual system framework shows superiority in the integration of information coordination of microsystem and exosystem. Guidance strategies are put forward to supplement the formation theory of opinion polarization and provide suggestions to reasonably regulate network group polarization.

<title>Building Bridges: Exploring the Communication Trends and Perceived Sociopolitical Benefits of Adolescents Engaging in Online Social Justice Efforts</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0044118X17723656</url>
<snippet>The exploration of social networking sites (SNS) offers great potential for understanding novel forms of youth civic engagement within the 21st century. SNS can foster a young person's social capital by connecting them to others with different backgrounds, thereby exposing them to alternative perspectives and lived experiences within a growingly polarized political environment. This study provides an innovative framework for examining the communication trends and perceived sociopolitical benefits for adolescents engaging diverse groups in a youth-led social-justice-oriented SNS. The author linked three school-based youth participatory action research projects involving 54 high school students through an SNS. Employing a mixed-method approach (i.e., social network analysis, key student interviews), results indicate an increase in communication between students in different schools and an increase in levels of civic participation. In addition, interviewees reported perceived gains in communication, perspective taking, and sociopolitical awareness. Implications for practitioners, as well as future research, are discussed.

<title>The Emergence and Stability of Groups in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.10.008</url>
<snippet>An important puzzle in social network research is to explain how macro-level structures emerge from micro-level network processes. Explaining the emergence and stability of structural groups in social networks is particularly difficult for two reasons. First, because groups are characterized both by high connectedness within (group cohesion) and lack of connectedness between them (group boundaries). Second, because a large number of theoretical micro-level network processes contribute to their emergence. We argue that traditional social network theories that are concerned with the evolution of positive relations (forces of attraction) are not sufficient to explain the emergence of groups because they lack mechanisms explaining the emergence of group boundaries. Models that additionally account for the evolution of negative ties (forces of repulsion) may be better suited to explain the emergence and stability of groups. We build a theoretical model and illustrate its usefulness by fitting stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs) to empirical data of co-evolving networks of friendship and dislike among 479 secondary-school students. The SAOMs include a number of newly developed effects expressing the co-evolution between positive and negative ties. We then simulate networks from the estimated models to explore the micro-macro link. We find that a model that considers forces of attraction and repulsion simultaneously is better at explaining groups in social networks. In the long run, however, the empirically informed simulations generate networks that are too stylized to be realistic, raising further questions about model degeneracy and time heterogeneity of group processes.

<title>An Interaction-Based and Graph-Based Hybrid Approach to Evaluate Trust in Online Social Networks (OSNs)</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13369-021-06332-w</url>
<snippet>With the digital revolution and the Web 2.0 era, web-based social networks such as Facebook and others have become popular mediums for users to do various activities. While social networks are becoming increasingly popular, concerns about trust and trust-related issues are also growing among users. There are many applications where trust plays a vital role in users' decision-making, requiring trust evaluation. There are several trust evaluation approaches for online social networks in the literature. However, the existing approaches focus only on certain aspects and believe that direct trust between participants is known. Thus, there is a need for a comprehensive trust evaluation approach that infers indirect trust and strives to measure direct trust. This paper proposes an interaction-based and graph-based hybrid approach that attempts to measure direct trust and infer indirect trust among users. Our direct trust measure method utilizes the most important features and similarities between users to measure direct trust. The proposed indirect trust inference method uses the graph theory concept to infer indirect trust. We implement the friend-request identification and the Sybil attack detection applications using the proposed direct trust measure method. Both the applications are evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets. The empirical results show that the friend-request identification application achieves a high accuracy of 96.17&#37;, and the Sybil attack detection application obtains a high detection rate of 93.20&#37;. The false rates of both applications are very low. The proposed indirect trust inference method is efficient, and it outperforms the existing approach.

<title>Networks and institutions in sustainable forest use: Evidence from South-East Tanzania</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.03.002</url>
<snippet>Despite growing interest in the impacts of both forest certification and networks in effective natural resource management, there is little literature that brings these two lines of inquiry together. Combining longitudinal remote sensing and village-level forest governance network data, we estimate Cox proportional hazard models predicting the risk of forest loss within 100-square meter forest plots in areas that eventually came under Forest Stewardship Council certification. Our models indicate Forest Stewardship Council certification substantially reduces deforestation, despite that the system is not explicitly designed to do so. While villages with ties to civil society organizations also tend to experience reduced deforestation, those with ties to private sector organizations experience more forest loss. Further, we find that forest loss declines as the share of closed triangles in villages' governance networks increases. Our results indicate network structure may complement Forest Stewardship Council certification's impact on forest cover and account for some reduction in deforestation previously attributed to certification itself.

<title>The Effect of Gossip on Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cplx.20334</url>
<snippet>In this article, we develop a simple model for the effect of gossip spread on social network structure. We define gossip as information passed between two individuals A and B about a third individual C which affects the strengths of all three relationships: it strengthens A-B and weakens both B-C and A-C. We find, in both an analytic derivation and model simulations, that if gossip does not spread beyond simple triads, it destroys them but if gossip propagates through large dense clusters, it strengthens them. Additionally, our simulations show that the effect of gossip on network metrics (clustering coefficient, average-path-length, and sum-of-strengths) varies with network structure and average-node-degree.

<title>Homophily of music listening in online social networks of China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.07.001</url>
<snippet>Homophily, ranging from demographics to sentiments, breeds connections in social networks, either offline or online. However, with the prosperous growth of music streaming services, whether homophily exists in online music listening remains unclear. In this study, two online social networks of the same group of active users who listened to complete songs over 1000 times and posted over 100 tweets are established, separately, in Netease Music and Weibo. Through presented multiple similarity measures, it is evidently demonstrated that homophily does exist in music listening for both online social networks. The unexpected listening similarity in Weibo also implies that knowledge from generic social networks can be confidently transferred to domain-oriented networks for context enrichment and algorithm enhancement. Comprehensive factors that might function in the formation of homophily are further probed, and many interesting patterns are profoundly revealed. It is found that female friends are more homogeneous in music listening and that positive and energetic songs significantly pull users close. Our methodology and findings shed light on realistic applications in online music services.

<title>DYNAMICS OF STRUCTURE - AN INDIVIDUAL ORIENTED APPROACH</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-8733(94)90014-0</url>
<snippet>The dynamics of network structure are considered, here as a consequence of individual choices with regard to relationships. We introduce the individual- or object-oriented modelling approach to model social networks. Object-oriented model building is based on acting so-called 'objects', communicating with and reacting to each other. Individuals are modelled as objects, each object with the possibility of having specific characteristics and behavioral rules. In contrast to many existing studies in the field of dynamic social networks, heterogeneity and dependence of dyads can easily be dealt with using this method. To clarify the new approach, we present a first simple model of the arising of friendship networks. For this simplicity, the model presented here is based solely on individuals' different needs for social contact, but can easily be extended. We present results about the effect of the distribution of individual needs on the network emergent structure.

<title>Assessing structural correlates to social capital in Facebook ego networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.01.002</url>
<snippet>Research in computer-mediated communication has consistently asserted that Facebook use is positively correlated with social capital. This research has drawn primarily on Williams' (2006) bridging and bonding scales as well as behavioral attributes such as civic engagement. Yet, as social capital is inherently a structural construct, it is surprising that so little work has been done relating social capital to social structure as captured by social network site (SNS) Friendship networks. Facebook is particularly well-suited to support the examination of structure at the ego level since the networks articulated on Facebook tend to be large, dense, and indicative of many offline foci (e.g., coworkers, friends from high school). Assuming that each one of these foci only partially overlap, we initially present two hypotheses related to Facebook social networks and social capital: more foci are associated with perceptions of greater bridging social capital and more closure is associated with greater bonding social capital. Using a study of 235 employees at a Midwestern American university, we test these hypotheses alongside self-reported measures of activity on the site. Our results only partially confirm these hypotheses. In particular, using a widely used measure of closure (transitivity) we observe a strong and persistent negative relationship to bonding social capital. Although this finding is initially counter-intuitive it is easily explained by considering the topology of Facebook personal networks: networks with primarily closed triads tend to be networks with tightly bound foci (such as everyone from high school knowing each other) and few connections between foci. Networks with primarily open triads signify many crosscutting friendships across foci. Therefore, bonding social capital appears to be less tied to local clustering than to global cohesion.

<title>The Core Might Change Anyhow We Define It: The Instability of Key Actors in Longitudinal Social Network Data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2024/3956877</url>
<snippet>Central actors or opinion leaders are in the right structural position to spread relevant information or convince others about adopting an innovation or behaviour change. Who is a central actor or opinion leader might be conceptualised in various ways. Widely accepted centrality measures do not take into account that those in central positions in the social network may change over time. A longitudinal comparison of the set and importance of opinion leaders is problematic with these measures and therefore needs a novel approach. In this study, we investigate ways to compare the stability of the set of central actors over time. Using longitudinal survey data from primary schools (where the members of the social networks do not change much over time) on advice-seeking and friendship networks, we find a relatively poor stability of who is in the central positions anyhow we define centrality. We propose the application of combined indices in order to achieve more efficient targeting results. Our results suggest that because opinion leaders may change over time, researchers should be careful about relying on simple centrality indices from cross-sectional data to gain and interpret information (for example, in the design of prevention programs, network-based interventions or infection control) and must rely on more diverse structural information instead.

<title>Spreading of fake news, competence and learning: kinetic modelling and numerical approximation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2021.0159</url>
<snippet>The rise of social networks as the primary means of communication in almost every country in the world has simultaneously triggered an increase in the amount of fake news circulating online. The urgent need for models that can describe the growing infodemic of fake news has been highlighted by the current pandemic. The resulting slowdown in vaccination campaigns due to misinformation and generally the inability of individuals to discern the reliability of information is posing enormous risks to the governments of many countries. In this research using the tools of kinetic theory, we describe the interaction between fake news spreading and competence of individuals through multi-population models in which fake news spreads analogously to an infectious disease with different impact depending on the level of competence of individuals. The level of competence, in particular, is subject to evolutionary dynamics due to both social interactions between agents and external learning dynamics. The results show how the model is able to correctly describe the dynamics of diffusion of fake news and the important role of competence in their containment.This article is part of the theme issue 'Kinetic exchange models of societies and economies'.

<title>Empirical Models of Social Learning in a Large, Evolving Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0160307</url>
<snippet>This paper advances theories of social learning through an empirical examination of how social networks change over time. Social networks are important for learning because they constrain individuals' access to information about the behaviors and cognitions of other people. Using data on a large social network of mobile device users over a one-month time period, we test three hypotheses: 1) attraction homophily causes individuals to form ties on the basis of attribute similarity, 2) aversion homophily causes individuals to delete existing ties on the basis of attribute dissimilarity, and 3) social influence causes individuals to adopt the attributes of others they share direct ties with. Statistical models offer varied degrees of support for all three hypotheses and show that these mechanisms are more complex than assumed in prior work. Although homophily is normally thought of as a process of attraction, people also avoid relationships with others who are different. These mechanisms have distinct effects on network structure. While social influence does help explain behavior, people tend to follow global trends more than they follow their friends.

<title>Reconsidering evidence of moral contagion in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01133-5</url>
<snippet>The ubiquity of social media use and the digital data traces it produces has triggered a potential methodological shift in the psychological sciences away from traditional, laboratory-based experimentation. The hope is that, by using computational social science methods to analyse large-scale observational data from social media, human behaviour can be studied with greater statistical power and ecological validity. However, current standards of null hypothesis significance testing and correlational statistics seem ill-suited to markedly noisy, high-dimensional social media datasets. We explore this point by probing the moral contagion phenomenon, whereby the use of moral-emotional language increases the probability of message spread. Through out-of-sample prediction, model comparisons and specification curve analyses, we find that the moral contagion model performs no better than an implausible XYZ contagion model. This highlights the risks of using purely correlational evidence from large observational datasets and sounds a cautionary note for psychology's merge with big data. Burton et al. probe the question of moral contagion through out-of-sample prediction, model comparisons and specification curve analyses, demonstrating the limitations of conclusions based on large-scale, observational social media datasets alone.

<title>Symmetric core-cohesive blockmodel in preschool children's interaction networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226801</url>
<snippet>Researchers have extensively studied the social mechanisms that drive the formation of networks observed among preschool children. However, less attention has been given to global network structures in terms of blockmodels. A blockmodel is a network where the nodes are groups of equivalent units (according to links to others) from a studied network. It is already shown that mutuality, popularity, assortativity, and different types of transitivity mechanisms can lead the global network structure to the proposed asymmetric core-cohesive blockmodel. Yet, they did not provide any evidence that such a global network structure actually appears in any empirical data. In this paper, the symmetric version of the core-cohesive blockmodel type is proposed. This blockmodel type consists of three or more groups of units. The units from each group are internally well linked to each other while those from different groups are not linked to each other. This is true for all groups, except one in which the units have mutual links to all other units in the network. In this study, it is shown that the proposed blockmodel type appears in empirical interactional networks collected among preschool children. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the most often studied social network mechanisms can lead the global network structure to the proposed symmetric blockmodel type. The units' attributes are not considered in this study.

<title>Citizen Science and Natural Resource Management: A Social Network Analysis of Two Community-Based Water Monitoring Programs</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2023.2183445</url>
<snippet>In natural resource management contexts, citizen science programs often involve a diversity of actors collaborating in broad social networks. However, the characteristics and functioning of these networks has received limited attention. In this article, we demonstrate the benefits of applying social network research to citizen science practice. Through a mixed methods approach, we compare data sharing and collaboration networks of two community-based water monitoring programs in Australia. The quantitative component revealed that despite similarities in actor diversity and activities, both programs have created divergent network structures (centralized vs decentralized) corresponding to their scale of influence in environmental decision-making (regional vs local impacts). The qualitative component showed how individuals navigated their relationships and managed key tensions inherent to network functioning. This study provides new insights on the role of social networks in citizen science and concludes by recommending program leaders adopt a "networking mindset" to maximize their sphere of influence.

<title>Unbiased metrics of friends' influence in multi-level networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-015-0057-x</url>
<snippet>The spreading of information is of crucial importance for the modern information society. While we still receive information from mass media and other non-personalized sources, online social networks and influence of friends have become important personalized sources of information. This calls for metrics to measure the influence of users on the behavior of their friends. We demonstrate that the currently existing metrics of friends' influence are biased by the presence of highly popular items in the data, and as a result can lead to an illusion of friends influence where there is none. We correct for this bias and develop three metrics that allow to distinguish the influence of friends from the effects of item popularity, and apply the metrics on real datasets. We use a simple network model based on the influence of friends and preferential attachment to illustrate the performance of our metrics at different levels of friends' influence.

<title>Rapid assessment of disaster damage using social media activity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1500779</url>
<snippet>Could social media data aid in disaster response and damage assessment? Countries face both an increasing frequency and an increasing intensity of natural disasters resulting from climate change. During such events, citizens turn to social media platforms for disaster-related communication and information. Social media improves situational awareness, facilitates dissemination of emergency information, enables early warning systems, and helps coordinate relief efforts. In addition, the spatiotemporal distribution of disaster-related messages helps with the real-time monitoring and assessment of the disaster itself. We present a multiscale analysis of Twitter activity before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy. We examine the online response of 50 metropolitan areas of the United States and find a strong relationship between proximity to Sandy's path and hurricane-related social media activity. We show that real and perceived threats, together with physical disaster effects, are directly observable through the intensity and composition of Twitter's message stream. We demonstrate that per-capita Twitter activity strongly correlates with the per-capita economic damage inflicted by the hurricane. We verify our findings for a wide range of disasters and suggest that massive online social networks can be used for rapid assessment of damage caused by a large-scale disaster.

<title>Considering baseline homophily when generating spatial social networks for agent-based modelling</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-012-9145-7</url>
<snippet>Social networks have become an important part of agent-based models, and their structure may have remarkable impact on simulation results. We propose a simple and efficient but empirically based approach for spatial agent-based models which explicitly takes into account restrictions and opportunities imposed by effects of baseline homophily, i.e. the influence of local socio-demography on the composition of one's social network. Furthermore, the algorithm considers the probability of links that depends on geographical distance between potential partners. The resulting network reflects social settings and furthermore allows the modeller to influence network properties by adjusting agent type specific parameters. Especially the parameter for distance dependence and the probability of distant links allow for control of clustering and agent type distribution of personal networks.

<title>Cognitive microfoundations and social interaction dynamics. The implications of complexity for institutional theory</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11186-024-09574-3</url>
<snippet>This paper investigates the intersection of cognitive sciences and social network theory and its counterpart, the complexity sciences, aiming to shed light on the compatibility and potential integration of these frameworks into institutional theory. Institutional scholars have for long selectively adopted notions linked with the cognitive sciences and complexity sciences, such as the notion of path dependence, without exploring the broader implications of systematically integrating such perspectives into institutionalism. This paper aims to advance such a comprehensive theoretical integration, by investigating the effective combination of these approaches and their significant implications. It shows how the complexity sciences contribute to dissolving the barriers between the cognitive and social realms and illustrates how this impacts notions of human agency and reflexivity. Theoretical integration also involves acknowledging considerable diversity in individual human agency, which in turn prompts a reconsideration of how notions of institutional stability, change, diffusion and adaptation are understood. Furthermore, the paper addresses the epistemological challenge presented by the complexity sciences, before it highlights the general relevance of institutional theory in analyzing complex social phenomena. Finally, the paper explores implications for research methodology, proposing that a fusion of institutional theory and the complexity sciences provides a metatheoretical framework for assessing the contextual suitability of different theoretical and methodological approaches.

<title>Measuring user engagement with low credibility media sources in a controversial online debate</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00342-w</url>
<snippet>We quantify social media user engagement with low-credibility online news media sources using a simple and intuitive methodology, that we showcase with an empirical case study of the Twitter debate on immigration in Italy. By assigning the Twitter users an Untrustworthiness (U) score based on how frequently they engage with unreliable media outlets and cross-checking it with a qualitative political annotation of the communities, we show that such information consumption is not equally distributed across the Twitter users. Indeed, we identify clusters characterised by a very high presence of accounts that frequently share content from less reliable news sources. The users with high U are more keen to interact with bot-like accounts that tend to inject more unreliable content into the network and to retweet that content. Thus, our methodology applied to this real-world network provides evidence, in an easy and straightforward way, that there is strong interplay between accounts that display higher bot-like activity and users more focused on news from unreliable sources and that this influences the diffusion of this information across the network.

<title>Temporal efficiency evaluation and small-worldness characterization in temporal networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep34291</url>
<snippet>Numerous real-world systems can be modeled as networks. To date, most network studies have been conducted assuming stationary network characteristics. Many systems, however, undergo topological changes over time. Temporal networks, which incorporate time into conventional network models, are therefore more accurate representations of such dynamic systems. Here, we introduce a novel generalized analytical framework for temporal networks, which enables 1) robust evaluation of the efficiency of temporal information exchange using two new network metrics and 2) quantitative inspection of the temporal small-worldness. Specifically, we define new robust temporal network efficiency measures by incorporating the time dependency of temporal distance. We propose a temporal regular network model, and based on this plus the redefined temporal efficiency metrics and widely used temporal random network models, we introduce a quantitative approach for identifying temporal small-world architectures (featuring high temporal network efficiency both globally and locally). In addition, within this framework, we can uncover network-specific dynamic structures. Applications to brain networks, international trade networks, and social networks reveal prominent temporal small-world properties with distinct dynamic network structures. We believe that the framework can provide further insight into dynamic changes in the network topology of various real-world systems and significantly promote research on temporal networks.

<title>Birds of moderately different feathers: Bandwagon dynamics and the threshold heterogeneity of network neighbors</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222500601013536</url>
<snippet>This paper investigates bandwagon dynamics in social networks, using an extension of Granovetter's (1978) threshold model. The focus is on the pattern of social ties connecting actors with different participation thresholds. A benchmark model, in which actors' thresholds are similar to their neighbors' thresholds, is built from the principle of homophily. Computational experiments show that participation levels increase when network structure departs from pure homophily, such that actors have new neighbors with discrepant thresholds. Further increasing the heterogeneity of network neighbors causes the bandwagon effects to wane, however, suggesting that bandwagon dynamics are maximized when there is a balance of heterogeneity and homogeneity in social networks. This principle is consistent with insights from several empirical studies and consistent with the conclusions of other formal models.

<title>Does it take &lt;i&gt;three&lt;/i&gt; to dance the Tango? Organizational design, triadic structures and boundary spanning across subunits</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.04.002</url>
<snippet>In this paper, we investigate the processes of boundary spanning across subunits within organizational networks. We hypothesize that patterns of advice across organizational subunits are explained by different triadic mechanisms depending on the organizational design of the intra-organizational network. In organizational networks characterized by limited hierarchical differentiation among members and horizontal coordination, we found triadic cyclic closure to be positively associated to boundary spanning across subunits; but when the network reflects an organizational structure with formal hierarchical differentiation among members, then we found triadic transitive closure to be associated to boundary spanning across subunits. We test these predictions in two empirical studies consisting of two organizational networks that differ from each other in organizational design. We adopt a Bayesian approach for exponential random graph models specifically designed for the statistical analysis of interpersonal relationships within and across subgroups or subunits. We suggest that the effects of informal, triadic network configurations on boundary spanning are contingent on formal organizational design.

<title>Social networks among auction bidders: The role of key bidders and structural properties on auction prices</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2013.11.002</url>
<snippet>Auctions have been studied extensively as an economic marketplace. The economist's focus is on modeling final sales prices, but the processes that give rise to those outcomes are rarely studied in great detail. This research is intended to provide that complementary perspective. We show how the interactions between bidders in an auction unfold in a dynamic pattern of bids and counter-bids, and thereby over the duration of an auction, create a network structure. The auction network contributes significantly to models of price dynamics and the network predicts final sales prices better than economic (non-network) indicators alone. In addition, network analyses are useful in identifying the key bidders whose actions seem to exert disproportionate influence on other bidders and the final sales prices. Furthermore, the key bidders may be identified very early in an auction process, which has practical implications for the auction house managers and for other bidders. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-019-00116-5</url>
<snippet>Community resilience is influenced by the structure of social networks in a community. In urban areas, social networks tend to be fragmented and diverse, and hence building community resilience is a challenge. Our objective is to shed light on how social network structures affect community resilience in two urban gardening groups in South Africa. The results of this qualitative study show that the two non-hierarchical groups place a strong emphasis on key personalities as leaders. The common motivation and shared values of the group help individuals overcome social heterogeneity and form trust. A decentralized network structure with different kinds of leaders helps group members divide power and responsibility; it also promotes a sense of ownership and capacity building in its members. Moreover, a no-money policy supports independence from access to financial resources, makes the group self-sufficient, and prevents conflict. Our results suggest that for a certain size of group, working in local clusters can create a decentralized network and a redundant leadership structure.

<title>Should I use my 'weak' social capital or 'strong' &lt;i&gt;guanxi&lt;/i&gt;? Reviewing and critiquing two theories in the context of Western-Chinese migration</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1440783320925152</url>
<snippet>Social network dynamics are complex in the context of Chinese overseas migration because of the unique dynamics of guanxi, which are distinctly different from 'Western' social capital. The few migration studies comparing guanxi and social capital suggest that the former largely consists 'strong ties', while the latter is comprised of 'weak ties'. However, most apply only a cursory comparison of one network facet. We review core literature in the two fields to contrast what each says about network norms, structures and practices. We find that: (i) guanxi is characterised by dynamics of 'face' and renqing; (ii) guanxi has core and peripheral aspects that grant it bonding and bridging qualities; (iii) weak ties in social capital networks are more beneficial for acquiring non-redundant resources, and for joining civic/voluntary associations; (iv) while strong, face-based guanxi ties better mobilise valuable resources, these ties are rarely transformed into social capital.

<title>Risk issue adoption in an online social movement field</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1620823</url>
<snippet>This article extends the field conceptualisation of social change and innovation adoption, which hinges upon the strategic capacities of actors, to the online environment. We focus on a key aspect of social movement organisations (SMOs), competition for members, resources and attention over an environmental risk issue. The incorporation of network theory enables us to map how the structural position of actors in the field is associated with their actions- for example, their response to an exogenous shock such as a new threat to the environment. We analyse how actors in the online environmental movement respond to the emergence of nanoscience and technology (NST) as a risk issue, and test the field theory hypothesis that dominated actors are more likely to adopt this issue in the early stages of emergence. Our findings challenge field theory orthodoxy and suggest that whilst challengers innovate, dominants co-opt by adopting the issue in a second stage. Finally, we examine why the notion that NST entails significant environmental and health risks was not propelled into wider public consciousness.

<title>Epidemic modeling for misinformation spread in digital networks through a social intelligence approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-69657-0</url>
<snippet>Online digital networks, including social networks, have significantly impacted individuals' personal and professional lives. Aside from exchanging news and topics of interest, digital networks play an essential role in the diffusion of information, which frequently significantly impacts worldwide societies. In this paper, we present a new mathematical epidemic model for digital networks that considers the sentiment of solitary misinformation in the networks and characteristics of human intelligence that play an important role in judging and spreading misinformation inside the networks. Our mathematical analysis has proved the existence and validity of the system in a real-time environment. Considering the real-world data, our simulation predicts how the misinformation could spread among different global communities and when an intervention mechanism should have to be carried out by the policyholders. Our simulation using the model proves that effective intervention mechanisms by isolating the fake news can effectively control the spread of misinformation among larger populations. The model can analyze the emotional and social intelligence of groups frequently subjected to disinformation and disseminating fake news.

<title>Social selection and peer influence in an online social network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1109739109</url>
<snippet>Disentangling the effects of selection and influence is one of social science's greatest unsolved puzzles: Do people befriend others who are similar to them, or do they become more similar to their friends over time? Recent advances in stochastic actor-based modeling, combined with self-reported data on a popular online social network site, allow us to address this question with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore been possible. Using data on the Facebook activity of a cohort of college students over 4 years, we find that students who share certain tastes in music and in movies, but not in books, are significantly likely to befriend one another. Meanwhile, we find little evidence for the diffusion of tastes among Facebook friends-except for tastes in classical/jazz music. These findings shed light on the mechanisms responsible for observed network homogeneity; provide a statistically rigorous assessment of the coevolution of cultural tastes and social relationships; and suggest important qualifications to our understanding of both homophily and contagion as generic social processes.

<title>How social learning amplifies moral outrage expression in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abe5641</url>
<snippet>Moral outrage shapes fundamental aspects of social life and is now widespread in online social networks. Here, we show how social learning processes amplify online moral outrage expressions over time. In two preregistered observational studies on Twitter (7331 users and 12.7 million total tweets) and two preregistered behavioral experiments (N = 240), we find that positive social feedback for outrage expressions increases the likelihood of future outrage expressions, consistent with principles of reinforcement learning. In addition, users conform their outrage expressions to the expressive norms of their social networks, suggesting norm learning also guides online outrage expressions. Norm learning overshadows reinforcement learning when normative information is readily observable: in ideologically extreme networks, where outrage expression is more common, users are less sensitive to social feedback when deciding whether to express outrage. Our findings highlight how platform design interacts with human learning mechanisms to affect moral discourse in digital public spaces.

<title>The nature of ICT in technology convergence: A knowledge-based network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254424</url>
<snippet>This study aims to understand the nature of information and communication technology in technology convergence. We form a knowledge network by applying social network theories to Korean patent data collected from the European Patent Organization. A knowledge network consists of nodes representing technology sectors identified by their International Patent Classification codes and edges that link International Patent Classification codes when they appear concurrently in a patent. We test the proposed hypotheses using four indices (degree centrality, E-I index, entropy index, and clustering coefficient). The results show that information and communication technology is easily attached but tends to converge with similar technology and has the greatest influence on technology convergence over other technologies. This study is expected to help practitioners and policymakers understand the structure and interaction mechanisms of technology from a systematic perspective and improve national-level technology policies.

<title>Cultural Holes: Beyond Relationality in Social Networks and Culture</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102615</url>
<snippet>A burgeoning literature spanning sociologies of culture and social network methods has for the past several decades sought to explicate the relationships between culture and connectivity. A number of promising recent moves toward integration are worthy of review, comparison, critique, and synthesis. Network thinking provides powerful techniques for specifying cultural concepts ranging from narrative networks to classification systems, tastes, and cultural repertoires. At the same time, we see theoretical advances by sociologists of culture as providing a corrective to network analysis as it is often portrayed, as a mere collection of methods. Cultural thinking complements and sets a new agenda for moving beyond predominant forms of structural analysis that ignore action, agency, and intersubjective meaning. The notion of "cultural holes" that we use to organize our review points both to the cultural contingency of network structure and to the increasingly permeable boundary between studies of culture and research on social networks.

<title>People are scarier than ghosts? Workplace haters and knowledge sharing</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.13278</url>
<snippet>Objective.In the workplace, colleague relationship deeply affects employees' work attitude and behavior, but it is rarely taken seriously. Based on the cognitive-affective personality system theory and social network theory, this study examined the influence of three common workplace haters (negative gossiper, two-faced person, and loafer) on employee well-being and knowledge sharing and explores the moderating effect of organizational social capital. Method.The study used longitudinal design, three-wave, and 409 valid supervisor-employee pairs (233 direct supervisors and 409 employees) from 10 companies in Taiwan to test these hypothetical relationships. Results. The findings of this study showed that: (1) workplace haters negatively affects employee well-being; (2) employee well-being positively affects knowledge sharing; (3) employee well-being mediates the relationship between workplace haters and knowledge sharing; and (4) organizational social capital moderates the relationship between workplace haters and employee well-being. Conclusion. The study has important contributions to the literature on workplace haters, coworker interaction, and social capital. Implications for behavioral researchers and human resource managers are discussed.

<title>The network structure of knowledge sharing among physicians</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-011-9494-1</url>
<snippet>This paper applies social network analysis in order to model knowledge sharing among hospital physicians. Drawing on the literature on the diffusion of innovation and cooperation in clinical settings, it aims to furnish better understanding of knowledge sharing in two directions: describing how knowledge flows and identifying individual and contextual factors which facilitate its spontaneous spreading. Used to address these issues is a link- tracing sample of about 800 Italian hospital physicians, potentially involved in prescribing a new drug. The paper represents knowledge sharing about the innovation as a network. It therefore specifies Exponential Random Graphs (ERG) or p* models to reconstruct the network structure of knowledge sharing and to test the effect of exogenous factors on the tendency to take action in the network. The results show that knowledge flows informally, exploiting mutual information-seeking relationships, and, consistently with previous studies, locally, with physicians tending to cluster in small groups of proximate and similar peers. Moreover empirical evidence is provided that the propensity to share information with colleagues is greatly affected by individual-specific characteristics, mainly by the experience in the field and the attitude toward the innovation, and by exposure to commercial communication.

<title>Social networks and cooperation in hunter-gatherers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature10736</url>
<snippet>Social networks show striking structural regularities(1,2), and both theory and evidence suggest that networks may have facilitated the development of large-scale cooperation in humans(3-7). Here, we characterize the social networks of the Hadza, a population of hunter-gatherers in Tanzania(8). We show that Hadza networks have important properties also seen in modernized social networks, including a skewed degree distribution, degree assortativity, transitivity, reciprocity, geographic decay and homophily. We demonstrate that Hadza camps exhibit high between-group and low within-group variation in public goods game donations. Network ties are also more likely between people who give the same amount, and the similarity in cooperative behaviour extends up to two degrees of separation. Social distance appears to be as important as genetic relatedness and physical proximity in explaining assortativity in cooperation. Our results suggest that certain elements of social network structure may have been present at an early point in human history. Also, early humans may have formed ties with both kin and non-kin, based in part on their tendency to cooperate. Social networks may thus have contributed to the emergence of cooperation.

<title>Spatial heterogeneity can lead to substantial local variations in COVID-19 timing and severity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011656117</url>
<snippet>Standard epidemiological models for COVID-19 employ variants of compartment (SIR or susceptible-infectious-recovered) models at local scales, implicitly assuming spatially uniform local mixing. Here, we examine the effect of employing more geographically detailed diffusion models based on known spatial features of interpersonal networks, most particularly the presence of a long-tailed but monotone decline in the probability of interaction with distance, on disease diffusion. Based on simulations of unrestricted COVID-19 diffusion in 19 US cities, we conclude that heterogeneity in population distribution can have large impacts on local pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate behavior at larger scales mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts observed include severe local outbreaks with long lag time relative to the aggregate infection curve, and the presence of numerous areas whose disease trajectories correlate poorly with those of neighboring areas. A simple catchment model for hospital demand illustrates potential implications for health care utilization, with substantial disparities in the timing and extremity of impacts even without distancing interventions. Likewise, analysis of social exposure to others who are morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic can appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk assessment and compliance with mitigation measures. These results demonstrate the potential for spatial network structure to generate highly nonuniform diffusion behavior even at the scale of cities, and suggest the importance of incorporating such structure when designing models to inform health care planning, predict community outcomes, or identify potential disparities.

<title>Polarized information ecosystems can reorganize social networks via information cascades</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2102147118</url>
<snippet>The precise mechanisms by which the information ecosystem polarizes society remain elusive. Focusing on political sorting in networks, we develop a computational model that examines how social network structure changes when individuals participate in information cascades, evaluate their behavior, and potentially rewire their connections to others as a result. Individuals follow proattitudinal information sources but are more likely to first hear and react to news shared by their social ties and only later evaluate these reactions by direct reference to the coverage of their preferred source. Reactions to news spread through the network via a complex contagion. Following a cascade, individuals who determine that their participation was driven by a subjectively "unimportant" story adjust their social ties to avoid being misled in the future. In our model, this dynamic leads social networks to politically sort when news outlets differentially report on the same topic, even when individuals do not know others' political identities. Observational follow network data collected on Twitter support this prediction: We find that individuals in more polarized information ecosystems lose cross-ideology social ties at a rate that is higher than predicted by chance. Importantly, our model reveals that these emergent polarized networks are less efficient at diffusing information: Individuals avoid what they believe to be "unimportant" news at the expense of missing out on subjectively "important" news far more frequently. This suggests that "echo chambers"-to the extent that they exist-may not echo so much as silence.

<title>Cooperation evaluation with the use of network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2018.07.005</url>
<snippet>The aim of the paper is to propose a way of assessing tourist partnerships using Social Network Analysis (SNA). The partnership structure chosen for this assessment was the `Wisla Tourist Organization' (WTO) - a Destination Marketing Organization operating in the south of Poland. Collaboration assessment was based on discovering if, and to what extent new types of relationships between WTO members exist - and how big a part of the network structure they cover. It was assumed that the higher the extent of partnership relations in the WTO based on direct relations between WTO's members including: business cooperation, communication, knowledge, trust, mutual understanding, dialogue, benefits from cooperation, and perceived fulfilled expectations, the higher the level of collaboration evaluation.

<title>(When) Is job-finding via personal contacts a meaningful concept for social network analysis? A comment to Chua (2011)</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2012.05.002</url>
<snippet>Chua (2011) argues that in a meritocratic context, institutions restrict the usefulness of social networks in exerting influence on job seekers' earnings. Regressing job-finding via personal contacts on earnings, he finds negative effects of influence via personal contacts, especially for the well-educated and individuals working in the state sector. In this comment, I argue that these results are ambiguous because (1) the analysis does not sufficiently distinguish between job 'search' methods and job 'finding' methods, (2) job-finding method indicates information flow rather than a personal contact's influence, and (3) it remains unclear whether Chua's analysis reflects the effect of network usage in job search per se or the effect of self-selection into network usage by individuals with low earning potential.

<title>Social learning and partisan bias in the interpretation of climate trends</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1722664115</url>
<snippet>Vital scientific communications are frequently misinterpreted by the lay public as a result of motivated reasoning, where people misconstrue data to fit their political and psychological biases. In the case of climate change, some people have been found to systematically misinterpret climate data in ways that conflict with the intended message of climate scientists. While prior studies have attempted to reduce motivated reasoning through bipartisan communication networks, these networks have also been found to exacerbate bias. Popular theories hold that bipartisan networks amplify bias by exposing people to opposing beliefs. These theories are in tension with collective intelligence research, which shows that exchanging beliefs in social networks can facilitate social learning, thereby improving individual and group judgments. However, prior experiments in collective intelligence have relied almost exclusively on neutral questions that do not engage motivated reasoning. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we conducted an online experiment to test how bipartisan social networks can influence subjects' interpretation of climate communications from NASA. Here, we show that exposure to opposing beliefs in structured bipartisan social networks substantially improved the accuracy of judgments among both conservatives and liberals, eliminating belief polarization. However, we also find that social learning can be reduced, and belief polarization maintained, as a result of partisan priming. We find that increasing the salience of partisanship during communication, both through exposure to the logos of political parties and through exposure to the political identities of network peers, can significantly reduce social learning.

<title>A new stochastic diffusion model for influence maximization in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33010-8</url>
<snippet>Most current studies on information diffusion in online social networks focus on the deterministic aspects of social networks. However, the behavioral parameters of online social networks are uncertain, unpredictable, and time-varying. Thus, deterministic graphs for modeling information diffusion in online social networks are too restrictive to solve most real network problems, such as influence maximization. Recently, stochastic graphs have been proposed as a graph model for social network applications where the weights associated with links in the stochastic graph are random variables. In this paper, we first propose a diffusion model based on a stochastic graph, in which influence probabilities associated with its links are unknown random variables. Then we develop an approach using the set of learning automata residing in the proposed diffusion model to estimate the influence probabilities by sampling from the links of the stochastic graph. Numerical simulations conducted on real and artificial stochastic networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic diffusion model for influence maximization.

<title>Network creation with homophilic agents</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00355-024-01562-x</url>
<snippet>Network Creation Games are an important framework for understanding the formation of real-world networks. These games usually assume a set of indistinguishable agents strategically buying edges at a uniform price, which leads to the formation of a network among them. However, in real life, agents are heterogeneous and their relationships often display a bias towards similar agents, say of the same ethnic group. This homophilic behavior on the agent level can then lead to the emergent global phenomenon of social segregation. We study Network Creation Games with multiple types of homophilic agents and non-uniform edge cost, introducing two models focusing on the perception of same-type and different-type neighbors, respectively. Despite their different initial conditions, both our theoretical and experimental analysis show that both the composition and segregation strength of the resulting stable networks are very similar, indicating a robust structure of social networks under homophily.

<title>The role of geography in the complex diffusion of innovations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-72137-w</url>
<snippet>The urban-rural divide is increasing in modern societies calling for geographical extensions of social influence modelling. Improved understanding of innovation diffusion across locations and through social connections can provide us with new insights into the spread of information, technological progress and economic development. In this work, we analyze the spatial adoption dynamics of iWiW, an Online Social Network (OSN) in Hungary and uncover empirical features about the spatial adoption in social networks. During its entire life cycle from 2002 to 2012, iWiW reached up to 300 million friendship ties of 3 million users. We find that the number of adopters as a function of town population follows a scaling law that reveals a strongly concentrated early adoption in large towns and a less concentrated late adoption. We also discover a strengthening distance decay of spread over the life-cycle indicating high fraction of distant diffusion in early stages but the dominance of local diffusion in late stages. The spreading process is modelled within the Bass diffusion framework that enables us to compare the differential equation version with an agent-based version of the model run on the empirical network. Although both model versions can capture the macro trend of adoption, they have limited capacity to describe the observed trends of urban scaling and distance decay. We find, however that incorporating adoption thresholds, defined by the fraction of social connections that adopt a technology before the individual adopts, improves the network model fit to the urban scaling of early adopters. Controlling for the threshold distribution enables us to eliminate the bias induced by local network structure on predicting local adoption peaks. Finally, we show that geographical features such as distance from the innovation origin and town size influence prediction of adoption peak at local scales in all model specifications.

<title>Adoption and adaptation: A computational case study of the spread of Granovetter's weak ties hypothesis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.01.001</url>
<snippet>How do new scientific ideas diffuse? Computational studies reveal how network structures facilitate or obstruct diffusion; qualitative studies demonstrate that diffusion entails the continuous translation and transformation of ideas. This article bridges these computational and qualitative approaches to study diffusion as a complex process of continuous adaptation. As a case study, we analyze the spread of Granovetter's Strength of Weak Ties hypothesis, published in American Journal of Sociology in 1973. Through network analysis, topic modeling and a close reading of a diffusion network created using Web of Science data, we study how different communities in this network interpret and develop Granovetter's hypothesis in distinct ways. We further trace how these communities originate, merge and split, and examine how central scholars emerge as community leaders or brokers in the diffusion process.

<title>Getting along to get ahead: The role of social context in tournament promotion and reward systems</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257389</url>
<snippet>Tournament theory posits that some organizations are modeled after sports tournaments whereby individuals are incentivized to compete and win against other members of the organization. A persistent criticism of tournament theory is that rank-order success of employees is entirely dependent on non-interacting or at least non-cooperating entities. To address what part, if any, cooperation plays in competitive tournaments, this study examines the role of social networks in tournament-style promotion and reward systems. Specifically, we seek to identify the importance of social relationships, such as group dissimilarity, initial tie formation, and tie strength in predicting tournament success. Bringing two largely independent research streams together (one focused on cooperation and one framed around competition), we examine how individuals' performance interacts with their social relationships-their social networks-to influence their chances of winning a tournament. Using the Survivor television series, we analyze the behaviors of 535 interacting contestants across 30 tournaments. In general, the findings help to illustrate how performance and social networks predict tournament advancement. Interestingly, we find that group dissimilarity based on gender, race, and age, largely does not play a role in advancement in the tournaments. Further, the strength of ties fails to mediate between variables such as group dissimilarity and initial tie formation. We conclude by discussing future directions for theoretical and practical exploration of tournament-style promotion systems. Recommendations include continuing to explore and test the role of social dynamics in compensation and promotion systems.

<title>Development, Reliability, and Validity of the Influences of Digital Technologies on Human Behavior in Public Space Scale Tested by Spatial Design Experts</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440241284589</url>
<snippet>The widespread use of digital technologies and online social networks causes a shift that has a pronounced impact on public space, public life, and public space design. However, research into this transformation is quite constrained. This study aims to illuminate how digital technologies influence individuals and their behavior in public spaces. A comprehensive conceptual scale was developed in the study to assess the impact of digital technology use on human behavior in public spaces. A structural equation model (SEM) was proposed after testing the scale's construct validity. According to the findings, the factors influencing the scale were social isolation (F1), media influence (F2), placelessness and/or homogeneity (F3), techno-stress-related social anxiety (F4), and digital addiction (F5). The SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) results demonstrated strong relationships among these factors, with digital addiction significantly predicting social isolation (beta = .90; p &lt; .01) and placelessness (beta = .74; p &lt; .01). The media influence factor had the most substantial effect on techno-stress-related social anxiety. This study contributes significantly to the literature by understanding the influences of digital technologies on public life and adapting public space design to this new reality. The findings also guide prospective studies into the effects of digital technologies in public spaces, offering valuable insights for urban planning, social psychology, architecture, and social sciences research.

<title>Financial and digital financial literacy through social media use towards financial inclusion among batik small enterprises in Indonesia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34902</url>
<snippet>Batik, an Indonesian textile art form, holds immense economic and cultural importance. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) specialising in batik play a crucial role in Indonesia's economic growth and cultural preservation, contributing significantly to the gross domestic product (GDP) and preserving the nation's heritage. Nevertheless, these enterprises face several challenges, such as slow growth and limited access to credit. The batik industry also lags in financial literacy and the adoption of digital marketing strategies, hindering its development. This quantitative study aims to investigate the relationship between financial literacy, digital financial literacy, and financial inclusion in batik SMEs and also examined the moderating effect of online social networks. A survey was conducted involving 535 managers, owners, and financial officers of small batik enterprises. Subsequently, the SmartPLS statistical analysis method was employed for data analysis. The results demonstrate that financial literacy and digital financial literacy play a significant role in accessing financial inclusion for batik small enterprises. Moreover, the utilisation of social media was found to moderate these relationships, amplifying the impact of financial and digital literacy on financial inclusion. The findings contribute to the existing knowledge, provide insights for enhancing batik small enterprises, and propose a digital financial model to promote financial inclusion.

<title>Topological measures for identifying and predicting the spread of complex contagions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24704-6</url>
<snippet>The standard measure of distance in social networks - average shortest path length - assumes a model of "simple" contagion, in which people only need exposure to influence from one peer to adopt the contagion. However, many social phenomena are "complex" contagions, for which people need exposure to multiple peers before they adopt. Here, we show that the classical measure of path length fails to define network connectedness and node centrality for complex contagions. Centrality measures and seeding strategies based on the classical definition of path length frequently misidentify the network features that are most effective for spreading complex contagions. To address these issues, we derive measures of complex path length and complex centrality, which significantly improve the capacity to identify the network structures and central individuals best suited for spreading complex contagions. We validate our theory using empirical data on the spread of a microfinance program in 43 rural Indian villages. Understanding of complex contagions is crucial for explaining diffusion processes in networks. Guilbeault and Centola introduce topological mechanisms and measures to elucidate spreading dynamics and identify the most influential nodes in social, epidemic and economic networks.

<title>Animal welfare: a social networks perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3184/003685016X14495640902331</url>
<snippet>Social network theory provides a useful tool to study complex social relationships in animals. The possibility to look beyond dyadic interactions by considering whole networks of social relationships allows researchers the opportunity to study social groups in more natural ways. As such, network-based analyses provide an informative way to investigate the factors influencing the social environment of group-living animals, and so has direct application to animal welfare. For example, animal groups in captivity are frequently disrupted by separations, reintroductions and/or mixing with unfamiliar individuals and this can lead to social stress and associated aggression. Social network analysis of animal groups can help identify the underlying causes of these socially-derived animal welfare concerns. In this review we discuss how this approach can be applied, and how it could be used to identify potential interventions and solutions in the area of animal welfare.

<title>A minimalistic model of bias, polarization and misinformation in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62085-w</url>
<snippet>Online social networks provide users with unprecedented opportunities to engage with diverse opinions. At the same time, they enable confirmation bias on large scales by empowering individuals to self-select narratives they want to be exposed to. A precise understanding of such tradeoffs is still largely missing. We introduce a social learning model where most participants in a network update their beliefs unbiasedly based on new information, while a minority of participants reject information that is incongruent with their preexisting beliefs. This simple mechanism generates permanent opinion polarization and cascade dynamics, and accounts for the aforementioned tradeoff between confirmation bias and social connectivity through analytic results. We investigate the model's predictions empirically using US county-level data on the impact of Internet access on the formation of beliefs about global warming. We conclude by discussing policy implications of our model, highlighting the downsides of debunking and suggesting alternative strategies to contrast misinformation.

<snippet>In this paper we investigate shifts in Twitter network topology resulting from the type of information being shared. We identified communities matching areas of agricultural expertise and measured the core-periphery centralization of network formations resulting from users sharing generic versus specialized information. We found that centralization increases when specialized information is shared and that the network adopts decentralized formations as conversations become more generic. The results are consistent with classical diffusion models positing that specialized information comes with greater centralization, but they also show that users favor decentralized formations, which can foster community cohesion, when spreading specialized information is secondary.

<title>Multi-criteria decision support for planning and evaluation of performance of viral marketing campaigns in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209372</url>
<snippet>The current marketing landscape, apart from conventional approaches, consists of campaigns designed especially for launching information diffusion processes within online networks. Associated research is focused on information propagation models, campaign initialization strategies and factors affecting campaign dynamics. In terms of algorithms and performance evaluation, the final coverage represented by the fraction of activated nodes within a target network is usually used. It is not necessarily consistent with the real marketing campaigns using various characteristics and parameters related to coverage, costs, behavioral patterns and time factors for overall evaluation. This paper presents assumptions for a decision support system for multi-criteria campaign planning and evaluation with inputs from agent-based simulations. The results, which are delivered from a simulation model based on synthetic networks in a form of decision scenarios, are verified within a real network. Last, but not least, the study proposes a multi-objective campaign evaluation framework with several campaign evaluation metrics integrated. The results showed that the recommendations generated with the use of synthetic networks applied to real networks delivered results according to the decision makers' expectation in terms of the used evaluation criteria. Apart from practical applications, the proposed multi-objective approach creates new evaluation possibilities for theoretical studies focused on information spreading processes within complex networks.

<title>Getting to Know You: Welfare Fraud Investigation and the Appropriation of Social Ties</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122418818198</url>
<snippet>State-level public assistance agencies completed nearly a million SNAP fraud investigations in fiscal year 2016. These investigations hinge on compiling incriminating information about clients. Drawing on interviews with welfare fraud workers in five U.S. states, this article shows how fraud investigators creatively exploit clients' social networks to extract such information, and thus use clients' social ties against them. Investigators gain some information through elective cooperation, when people voluntarily implicate others. Fraud workers say these denunciations typically arise from negative-valence ties (bad blood). Other times, investigators co-opt neutral or positive-valence ties (good will) for enforcement purposes. This co-optation includes eliciting information from unwitting acquaintances and exploiting clients' own online social networking activity. These findings demonstrate social ties' appropriability, through which they serve as resources for relational outsiders' interests. Repurposing welfare clients' social ties for fraud enforcement presents a two-fold threat to subsistence and social mobility prospects: it imposes punishments-including program disqualifications-while simultaneously damaging social support networks. These enforcement practices reveal appropriability as an unrecognized property of social ties, particularly for socioeconomically marginalized people, and constitute a noteworthy element of contemporary poverty governance.

In this study, we use social network theory and analysis (SNA), an emerging approach for understanding social dynamics in restoration projects, to examine the social connections, perceptions of project success, and attitudes of stakeholders involved in a river restoration project. We find that positive and negative social network ties have asymmetrical effects on stakeholders' attitudes and satisfaction with project outcomes. Trust ties positively influence perceptions of public engagement, while avoidance ties negatively influence satisfaction. Trust in leaders positively influences satisfaction and both public engagement and perceived conflict influence the development of that trust. We contribute to the growing body of research using SNA in natural resource contexts through quantitative tests of social networks' effects on stakeholder satisfaction with project outcomes.

<title>Social inheritance can explain the structure of animal social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12084</url>
<snippet>The social network structure of animal populations has major implications for survival, reproductive success, sexual selection and pathogen transmission of individuals. But as of yet, no general theory of social network structure exists that can explain the diversity of social networks observed in nature, and serve as a null model for detecting species and population specific factors. Here we propose a simple and generally applicable model of social network structure. We consider the emergence of network structure as a result of social inheritance, in which newborns are likely to bond with maternal contacts, and via forming bonds randomly. We compare model output with data from several species, showing that it can generate networks with properties such as those observed in real social systems. Our model demonstrates that important observed properties of social networks, including heritability of network position or assortative associations, can be understood as consequences of social inheritance.

<title>Network quantile autoregression</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2019.04.034</url>
<snippet>The complex tail dependency structure in a dynamic network with a large-number of nodes is an important object to study. We propose a network quantile autoregression model (NQAR), which characterizes the dynamic quantile behavior. Our NQAR model consists of a system of equations, of which we relate a response to its connected nodes and node Specific characteristics in a quantile autoregression process. we show the estimation of the NQAR model and the asymptotic properties with assumptions on the network structure. For this propose we develop a network Bahadur representation that gives us direct insight into the parameter asymptotics. Moreover innovative tail-event driven impulse functions are defined. Finally, We demonstrate the usage of our model by investigating the financial contagions in the Chinese stock Market accounting for shared ownership of Companies. We find higher network dependency when the market is exposed to a higher volatility level. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

<title>Using GPS Technology to Quantify Human Mobility, Dynamic Contacts and Infectious Disease Dynamics in a Resource-Poor Urban Environment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058802</url>
<snippet>Empiric quantification of human mobility patterns is paramount for better urban planning, understanding social network structure and responding to infectious disease threats, especially in light of rapid growth in urbanization and globalization. This need is of particular relevance for developing countries, since they host the majority of the global urban population and are disproportionally affected by the burden of disease. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) data-loggers to track the fine-scale (within city) mobility patterns of 582 residents from two neighborhoods from the city of Iquitos, Peru. We used similar to 2.3 million GPS data-points to quantify age-specific mobility parameters and dynamic co-location networks among all tracked individuals. Geographic space significantly affected human mobility, giving rise to highly local mobility kernels. Most (similar to 80&#37;) movements occurred within 1 km of an individual's home. Potential hourly contacts among individuals were highly irregular and temporally unstructured. Only up to 38&#37; of the tracked participants showed a regular and predictable mobility routine, a sharp contrast to the situation in the developed world. As a case study, we quantified the impact of spatially and temporally unstructured routines on the dynamics of transmission of an influenza-like pathogen within an Iquitos neighborhood. Temporally unstructured daily routines (e.g., not dominated by a single location, such as a workplace, where an individual repeatedly spent significant amount of time) increased an epidemic's final size and effective reproduction number by 20&#37; in comparison to scenarios modeling temporally structured contacts. Our findings provide a mechanistic description of the basic rules that shape human mobility within a resource-poor urban center, and contribute to the understanding of the role of fine-scale patterns of individual movement and co-location in infectious disease dynamics. More generally, this study emphasizes the need for careful consideration of human social interactions when designing infectious disease mitigation strategies, particularly within resource-poor urban environments.

<title>Collaboration and growth in a large research cooperative: A network analytic approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2023.102375</url>
<snippet>Research networks encourage team science and facilitate collaboration within and across research teams. While many analyses have examined the output of these collaborative networks (e.g., authorship networks, publications, grant applications), less attention has been paid to the formative phases of these initiatives. This article presents analyses of a whole-network survey of investigators participating in a new research initiative, and examines the development of collaborative ties over the network's first year. In particular, we examine the influence of research center affiliation, seniority, and prior network experience on the number and structure of collaborative ties, including participants' bridging and broker roles. Such analyses can inform the overall management of the project in purposefully promoting new collaboration opportunities, and may ultimately predict the number of collaborative products generated by the network members.

<title>Impact of Homophily on Diffusion Dynamics Over Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439313512464</url>
<snippet>The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of homophily on diffusion over social networks. An agent-based simulation model is developed to serve as the experimental ground for this analysis. Diffusion dynamics of a nonsticky innovation is investigated by varying homophily levels in the social network depicted in the model as the primary control variable. First of all, the results show that homophily is self-reinforcing. Second, starting from a nonhomophilous network, early increases in the level of homophily have a positive effect on the extent of diffusion, whereas further increases have a negative impact. Finally, several local minima and maxima are observed in the relation between the homophily level and the extent of diffusion. Our analysis focuses on node properties such as connectedness and average degrees in order to explain the observed regular relationship between homophily and diffusion. We argue that (i) homophily increases the connectedness of different status groups separately and (ii) increasing levels of homophily decreases the marginal importance of a single homophilous tie by increasing the sources of valuable information. Future research involves investigating the coevolution of social behavior and networks by allowing the adopted innovation to lead to value homophily, exploration of different diffusion initiation types, and different adoption heuristics.

<title>Can Cultural Worldviews Influence Network Composition?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Most sociological research assumes that social network composition shapes individual beliefs. Network theory and research has not adequately considered that internalized cultural worldviews might affect network composition. Drawing on a synthetic, dual-process theory of culture and two waves of nationally-representative panel data, this article shows that worldviews are strong predictors of changes in network composition among U.S. youth. These effects arc robust to the influence of other structural factors, including prior network composition and behavioral homophily. By contrast, there is little evidence that networks play a strong proximate role in shaping worldviews. This suggests that internalized cultural dispositions play an important role in shaping the interpersonal environment and that the dynamic link between culture and social structure needs to be reconsidered.

<title>White matter connectivity in brain networks supporting social and affective processing predicts real-world social network characteristics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03655-8</url>
<snippet>Human behavior is embedded in social networks. Certain characteristics of the positions that people occupy within these networks appear to be stable within individuals. Such traits likely stem in part from individual differences in how people tend to think and behave, which may be driven by individual differences in the neuroanatomy supporting socio-affective processing. To investigate this possibility, we reconstructed the full social networks of three graduate student cohorts (N = 275; N = 279; N = 285), a subset of whom (N = 112) underwent diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Although no single tract in isolation appears to be necessary or sufficient to predict social network characteristics, distributed patterns of white matter microstructural integrity in brain networks supporting social and affective processing predict eigenvector centrality (how well-connected someone is to well-connected others) and brokerage (how much one connects otherwise unconnected others). Thus, where individuals sit in their real-world social networks is reflected in their structural brain networks. More broadly, these results suggest that the application of data-driven methods to neuroimaging data can be a promising approach to investigate how brains shape and are shaped by individuals' positions in their real-world social networks. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging reveals that students' standing in their real-world social networks is reflected in patterns of brain network connectivity.

<title>Modeling influence on posting engagement in online social networks: Beyond neighborhood effects</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.05.005</url>
<snippet>In many online social networks (OSN), Member A can observe the online participation of Member B and thus may be exposed to a shift in the online participation of B. Such exposure is often modeled by a neighbor-to-neighbor spreading process that can lead to local influence. In other words, exposure to participation shifts of Neighbor B can exert local influence on A's posting engagement. Since many posts nowadays are public rather than private, exposure to participation shifts of non-neighbors outside A's neighborhood can exert global influence on A's posting engagement. We model influence spread in an OSN by differentiating between exposure to participation shifts of local and global influence sources. The results of applying the proposed model to different temporal dynamic OSNs show evidence of both local and global influence on posting engagement of members. This consideration of global influence in OSNs, beyond neighborhood effects, extends past research that focused mainly on local influence and provides new insights about influence sources in general and viral marketing in particular.

<title>Measuring segregation in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.04.001</url>
<snippet>Network homophily is a pattern in which ties are more likely to exist between nodes similar to each other. It is frequently observed for various types of social relations. At the same time, segregation is often encountered in urban areas as a tendency of families to occupy neighborhoods inhabited by other families similar to them. In this paper we conceptualize both phenomena as in the language of networks of interlinked positions occupied by a population of actors characterized by some node-level attribute. We review existing indexes and approaches to measuring the extent of homophily/segregation in social networks. We pursue an approach of, first, specifying a set of properties that a generic segregation measure might possess, and which, in our view, are relevant in substantial contexts. Second, we check which measures satisfy which properties. The use of measures is illustrated with four empirical examples. Given the particular application and the need for some descriptive measure of segregation, the results presented in this paper can help in selecting an optimal measure for the task at hand. We conclude that the most crucial aspects for the choice of a particular segregation measure include (1) whether the network ties or actors' attributes are assumed to be subject to change, and (2) how one should treat the presence of network isolates.

<title>Estimation and correction of bias in network simulations based on respondent-driven sampling data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63269-0</url>
<snippet>Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is widely used for collecting data on hard-to-reach populations, including information about the structure of the networks connecting the individuals. Characterizing network features can be important for designing and evaluating health programs, particularly those that involve infectious disease transmission. While the validity of population proportions estimated from RDS-based datasets has been well studied, little is known about potential biases in inference about network structure from RDS. We developed a mathematical and statistical platform to simulate network structures with exponential random graph models, and to mimic the data generation mechanisms produced by RDS. We used this framework to characterize biases in three important network statistics - density/mean degree, homophily, and transitivity. Generalized linear models were used to predict the network statistics of the original network from the network statistics of the sample network and observable sample design features. We found that RDS may introduce significant biases in the estimation of density/mean degree and transitivity, and may exaggerate homophily when preferential recruitment occurs. Adjustments to network-generating statistics derived from the prediction models could substantially improve validity of simulated networks in terms of density, and could reduce bias in replicating mean degree, homophily, and transitivity from the original network.

<title>Modeling the Adoption of Innovations in the Presence of Geographic and Media Influences</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029528</url>
<snippet>While there is a large body of work examining the effects of social network structure on innovation adoption, models to date have lacked considerations of real geography or mass media. In this article, we show these features are crucial to making more accurate predictions of a social contagion and technology adoption at a city-to-city scale. Using data from the adoption of the popular micro-blogging platform, Twitter, we present a model of adoption on a network that places friendships in real geographic space and exposes individuals to mass media influence. We show that homophily both among individuals with similar propensities to adopt a technology and geographic location is critical to reproducing features of real spatiotemporal adoption. Furthermore, we estimate that mass media was responsible for increasing Twitter's user base two to four fold. To reflect this strength, we extend traditional contagion models to include an endogenous mass media agent that responds to those adopting an innovation as well as influencing agents to adopt themselves.

<title>The Sociology of Creativity: Elements, Structures, and Audiences</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-121919-054833</url>
<snippet>This review integrates diverse characterizations of creativity from a sociological perspective with the goal of reinvigorating discussion of the sociology of creativity. We start by exploring relevant works of classical social theory to uncover key assumptions and principles, which are used as a theoretical basis for our proposed definition of creativity: an intentional configuration of cultural and material elements that is unexpected for a given audience. Our argument is enriched by locating creativity vis-a-vis related concepts-such as originality, knowledge, innovation, atypicality, and consecration-and across neighboring disciplines. Underlying the discussion are antecedents (structure, institutions, and context) and consequences (audiences, perception, and evaluation), which are treated separately. We end our review by speculating on ways in which sociologists can take the discussion of creativity forward.

<title>Reconstructing missing complex networks against adversarial interventions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09774-x</url>
<snippet>Interactions within complex network components define their operational modes, collective behaviors and global functionality. Understanding the role of these interactions is limited by either sensing methodologies or intentional adversarial efforts that sabotage the network structure. To overcome the partial observability and infer with good fidelity the unobserved network structures (latent subnetworks that are not random samples of the full network), we propose a general causal inference framework for reconstructing network structures under unknown adversarial interventions. We explore its applicability in both biological and social systems to recover the latent structures of human protein complex interactions and brain connectomes, as well as to infer the camouflaged social network structure in a simulated removal process. The demonstrated effectiveness establishes its good potential for capturing hidden information in much broader research domains.

<title>When Do Haters Act? Peer Evaluation, Negative Relationships, and Brokerage</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.15195/v11.a16</url>
<snippet>In many organizational settings, individuals make evaluations in the context of affect -based negative relationships, in which an evaluator personally dislikes the evaluated individual. However, these dislikes are often held in check by norms of professionalism that preclude the use of personal preferences in objective evaluations. In this article, we draw from social network theory to suggest that only individuals that are network brokers-those who have the cognitive freedom to flout organizational norms-act to down -evaluate the peers they dislike. We evaluate our theory using two complementary studies: one field site study and an experiment. Our results, consistent across two different methodologies, suggest that overlooking an evaluator's negative relationships as well as the network positions that constrain or enable an individual's actions may lead to distortions in ubiquitous organizational peer evaluations processes and outcomes.

<title>OPINION-AWARE INFLUENCE MAXIMIZATION: HOW TO MAXIMIZE A FAVORITE OPINION IN A SOCIAL NETWORK?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219525918500224</url>
<snippet>Influence maximization is a well-known problem in the social network analysis literature which is to find a small subset of seed nodes to maximize the diffusion or spread of information. The main application of this problem in the real-world is in viral marketing. However, the classic influence maximization is disabled to model the real-world viral marketing problem, since the effect of the marketing message content and nodes' opinions have not been considered. In this paper, a modified version of influence maximization which is named as "opinion-aware influence maximization" (OAIM) problem is proposed to make the model more realistic. In this problem, the main objective is to maximize the spread of a desired opinion, by optimizing the message content, rather than the number of infected nodes, which leads to selection of the best set of seed nodes. A nonlinear bi-objective mathematical programming model is developed to model the considered problem. Some transformation techniques are applied to convert the proposed model to a linear single-objective mathematical programming model. The exact solution of the model in small datasets can be obtained by CPLEX algorithm. For the medium and large-scale datasets, a new genetic algorithm is proposed to cope with the size of the problem. Experimental results on some of the well-known datasets show the efficiency and applicability of the proposed OAIM model. In addition, the proposed genetic algorithm overcomes state-of-the-art algorithms.

<title>Reach and speed of judgment propagation in the laboratory</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1611998114</url>
<snippet>In recent years, a large body of research has demonstrated that judgments and behaviors can propagate from person to person. Phenomena as diverse as political mobilization, health practices, altruism, and emotional states exhibit similar dynamics of social contagion. The precise mechanisms of judgment propagation are not well understood, however, because it is difficult to control for confounding factors such as homophily or dynamic network structures. We introduce an experimental design that renders possible the stringent study of judgment propagation. In this design, experimental chains of individuals can revise their initial judgment in a visual perception task after observing a predecessor's judgment. The positioning of a very good performer at the top of a chain created a performance gap, which triggered waves of judgment propagation down the chain. We evaluated the dynamics of judgment propagation experimentally. Despite strong social influence within pairs of individuals, the reach of judgment propagation across a chain rarely exceeded a social distance of three to four degrees of separation. Furthermore, computer simulations showed that the speed of judgment propagation decayed exponentially with the social distance from the source. We show that information distortion and the overweighting of other people's errors are two individual-level mechanisms hindering judgment propagation at the scale of the chain. Our results contribute to the understanding of social-contagion processes, and our experimental method offers numerous new opportunities to study judgment propagation in the laboratory.

<title>Local Majority-with-inertia Rule Can Explain Global Consensus Dynamics in A Network Coordination Game</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.01.013</url>
<snippet>We study how groups reach consensus by varying communication network structure and individual incentives. In 342 networks of seven individuals, single opinionated "leaders" can drive decision outcomes, but do not accelerate consensus formation, whereas conflicting opinions slow consensus. While networks with more links reach consensus faster, this advantage disappears under conflict. Unopinionated individuals make choices consistent with a local majority rule combined with "inertia" favouring their previous choice, while opinionated individuals favour their preferred option but yield under high peer or time pressure. Simulations show these individual rules can account for group patterns, and allow rapid consensus while preventing deadlocks.

<title>DIFFERENTIAL PARTICIPATION IN PROFESSIONAL ACTIVISM: THE CASE OF THE GUANTANAMO HABEAS LAWYERS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Scholars of social movements tend to regard professionals as a homogeneous group whose activism plays a secondary role in mobilization processes. In this article, I focus on activism driven by professionals themselves and therein examine how heterogeneous professionals participate in their activism. Drawing on the case of the Guantanamo habeas lawyers, I utilize a two-step methodology to investigate the factors that contribute to the differential participation of legal professionals. The first stage of analysis shows that while lawyers with higher status played a critical role in initiating professional activism under a hostile environment, the Rasul v. Bush ruling opened up a legal opportunity for lawyers with lower status to participate in activism. In the second stage, social network analyses of the lawyers' collaborative structure reveal that movement-affiliated lawyers played a bridging role that coordinated initiators and latecomers. The results have important implications for understanding professionals' participation in contentious politics.

<title>Parsing Social Network Survey Data from Hidden Populations Using Stochastic Context-Free Grammars</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006777</url>
<snippet>Background: Human populations are structured by social networks, in which individuals tend to form relationships based on shared attributes. Certain attributes that are ambiguous, stigmatized or illegal can create a OhiddenO population, so-called because its members are difficult to identify. Many hidden populations are also at an elevated risk of exposure to infectious diseases. Consequently, public health agencies are presently adopting modern survey techniques that traverse social networks in hidden populations by soliciting individuals to recruit their peers, e. g., respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The concomitant accumulation of network-based epidemiological data, however, is rapidly outpacing the development of computational methods for analysis. Moreover, current analytical models rely on unrealistic assumptions, e. g., that the traversal of social networks can be modeled by a Markov chain rather than a branching process. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we develop a new methodology based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), which are well-suited to modeling tree-like structure of the RDS recruitment process. We apply this methodology to an RDS case study of injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana, Mexico, a hidden population at high risk of blood-borne and sexually-transmitted infections (i.e., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syphilis). Survey data were encoded as text strings that were parsed using our custom implementation of the inside-outside algorithm in a publicly-available software package (HyPhy), which uses either expectation maximization or direct optimization methods and permits constraints on model parameters for hypothesis testing. We identified significant latent variability in the recruitment process that violates assumptions of Markov chain-based methods for RDS analysis: firstly, IDUs tended to emulate the recruitment behavior of their own recruiter; and secondly, the recruitment of like peers (homophily) was dependent on the number of recruits. Conclusions: SCFGs provide a rich probabilistic language that can articulate complex latent structure in survey data derived from the traversal of social networks. Such structure that has no representation in Markov chain-based models can interfere with the estimation of the composition of hidden populations if left unaccounted for, raising critical implications for the prevention and control of infectious disease epidemics.

<title>Low status rejection: How status hierarchies influence negative tie formation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.08.005</url>
<snippet>Scholarship investigating how social status patterns negative ties has yielded contradictory findings. Three likely sources for these differences are: different measures of social status, measures of negative ties (perceived versus dyadic), and structural factors. This study uses multiple measures of social status, sociometrically-measured negative ties, and multiple analytic approaches - MRQAP to control for structure and within-individual to control for heterogeneity - to help resolve this debate. We find: negative ties travel down status hierarchies and target low status individuals, and a negative tie between two people becomes more likely as their status difference increases. These results suggest a low-status rejection mechanism.

<snippet>The task of extracting and analyzing character networks from works of fiction, such as novels and movies, has been the object of a number of recent publications. However, only a very few of them focus on graphic novels, and even fewer on European graphic novels. In this paper, we focus on Thorgal, a bande dessinee, i.e. a comic of the French-Belgian tradition. We manually annotate all the volumes of this series, in order to constitute a corpus allowing us to extract its character network. We perform a descriptive analysis of the network structure and compare it to real-world and fictional social networks. We also study the effect of character filtering over the network structure. Finally, we leverage complex network analysis tools to answer two research questions from the literature, related to the similarity between Thorgal and the Saga of Icelanders; and to the position of women in the series. Our data and source code are both publicly available online.

<title>Avoidance in negative ties: Inhibiting closure, reciprocity, and homophily</title>

<snippet>Theorising of negative ties has focused on simplex negative tie networks or multiplex signed tie networks. We examine the fundamental differences between positive and negative tie networks measured on the same set of actors. We test six mechanisms of tie formation on face-to-face positive (affect/esteem) and negative (dislike/disesteem) networks of 282 university students. While popularity, activity, and entrainment are present in both networks, closure, reciprocity, and homophily are largely absent from negative tie networks. We argue this arises because avoidance is inherent to negative sentiments. Avoidance reduces information transfer through negative ties and short-circuits cumulative causation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

<title>Knowledge diffusion of dynamical network in terms of interaction frequency</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-11057-8</url>
<snippet>In this paper, we present a knowledge diffusion (SKD) model for dynamic networks by taking into account the interaction frequency which always used to measure the social closeness. A set of agents, which are initially interconnected to form a random network, either exchange knowledge with their neighbors or move toward a new location through an edge-rewiring procedure. The activity of knowledge exchange between agents is determined by a knowledge transfer rule that the target node would preferentially select one neighbor node to transfer knowledge with probability p according to their interaction frequency instead of the knowledge distance, otherwise, the target node would build a new link with its second-order neighbor preferentially or select one node in the system randomly with probability 1 - p. The simulation results show that, comparing with the Null model defined by the random selection mechanism and the traditional knowledge diffusion (TKD) model driven by knowledge distance, the knowledge would spread more fast based on SKD driven by interaction frequency. In particular, the network structure of SKD would evolve as an assortative one, which is a fundamental feature of social networks. This work would be helpful for deeply understanding the coevolution of the knowledge diffusion and network structure.

<title>Infant mortality, social networks, and subsequent fertility</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000312240607100206</url>
<snippet>The research presented here addresses a longstanding but previously unsupported theoretical proposition related to social learning in the demographic literature. This is that individuals should respond to lower (higher) infant mortality of socially proximate others with decreased (increased) fertility On a more general level this problem directly concerns the translation of the effects of macro-demographic forces such as mortality into micro-level individual behavior through social interaction. Using unique data that combine identification of individuals belonging to women social networks with direct measurement of these network members' mortality experience, this research demonstrates such a linkage. Information concerning the level and variation in infant mortality available to women from a small Nepalese mountain population in their social networks is seen to influence the tempo of their fertility. It is suggested that the methodology employed has important implications for quantitative analyses of reciprocal processes of social construction and micro-macro linkages more generally.

<snippet>In social systems ranging from ant colonies to human society, behavioural specialization-consistent individual differences in behaviour-is commonplace: individuals can specialize in the tasks they perform (division of labour (DOL)), the political behaviour they exhibit (political polarization) or the non-task behaviours they exhibit (personalities). Across these contexts, behavioural specialization often co-occurs with modular and assortative social networks, such that individuals tend to associate with others that have the same behavioural specialization. This raises the question of whether a common mechanism could drive co-emergent behavioural specialization and social network structure across contexts. To investigate this question, here we extend a model of self-organized DOL to account for social influence and interaction bias among individuals-social dynamics that have been shown to drive political polarization. We find that these same social dynamics can also drive emergent DOL by forming a feedback loop that reinforces behavioural differences between individuals, a feedback loop that is impacted by group size. Moreover, this feedback loop also results in modular and assortative social network structure, whereby individuals associate strongly with those performing the same task. Our findings suggest that DOL and political polarization-two social phenomena not typically considered together-may actually share a common social mechanism. This mechanism may result in social organization in many contexts beyond task performance and political behaviour.

<title>Examining the spatial networks of an urban agglomeration through the lens of multi-dimensional element flow: Evidence from western China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e20949</url>
<snippet>The Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration (CCUA), as the only national-level city cluster in southwestern China, serves as a strategic support for the Yangtze River Economic Belt and an important demonstration area for promoting new urbanization in the country. The study of the networked characteristics of the CCUA contributes to a systematic understanding of its spatial connectivity patterns, optimization of spatial structure and layout, and promotion of high-quality regional development. In this study, we constructed models for traffic flow, information flow, migration flow, and composite flow to calculate the strength of connections between cities and the total flow of various elements in the CCUA. ArcGIS spatial visualization tools were used to depict the spatial connectivity patterns of the element flows within the CCUA. Additionally, social network analysis methods, including network density, centrality, and cohesive subgroups analysis, were employed to reveal the spatial network structure characteristics of the CCUA. The findings are as follows: (1) The overall structure of the cities within the CCUA is relatively loose, with significant differences in connectivity strength. It exhibits a west-strong and east-weak pattern, with Chengdu-Chongqing, Chengdu-Deyang, Chengdu-Mianyang, and Chengdu-Meishan occupying the top tier, while Zigong and Ya'an have relatively weak connections with other cities. Chengdu and Chongqing have prominent positions in the CCUA, with Chengdu having a more prominent core position compared to Chongqing, resulting in an overall hierarchical distribution of "1 + 1+7 + 7". (2) The network density of the element flows in the CCUA is relatively low, indicating a generally weak element connectivity. The centrality of cities other than Chengdu and Chongqing is at a moderate to lower level, suggesting a weak overall resource connectivity capacity in the CCUA. (3) Most cities tend to form cohesive subgroups based on geographic proximity, while the cohesive subgroup in Chongqing is still in its early stages of development due to administrative boundaries. The research results quantitatively depict the spatial network structure characteristics of the CCUA, providing theoretical references for its development.

<title>Knowledge and innovation relationships in the shrimp industry in Thailand and Mexico</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0900555106</url>
<snippet>Experts, government officials, and industry leaders concerned about the sustainability of shrimp aquaculture believe they know what farmers need to know and should be doing. They have framed sustainability as a technical problem that, at the farm level, is to be solved by better shrimp and management of ponds and businesses. Codes of conduct, standards, and regulations are expected to bring deviant practices into line. Shrimp farmers are often cornered in a challenging game of knowledge in which their livelihoods are at stake. In the commodity chain there are multiple relations with both suppliers and buyers, not all of which are trustworthy. The social networks shrimp farmers belong to are crucial for sifting out misinformation and multiplying insights from personal experience in learning by doing. Successful farmers become part of a learning culture through seminars, workshops, and clubs in which knowledge and practices are continually re-evaluated. The combination of vertical and horizontal relationships creates a set of alternative arenas that together are critical to bridging knowledge and action gaps for shrimp farmers. Government and industry initiatives for improving links between knowledge and practice for sustainability have largely succeeded when incentives are aligned: shrimp grow better in healthy environments, and using fewer resources means higher profits.

<title>Structural holes and bridging in two-mode networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.04.001</url>
<snippet>Social networks are often structured in such a way that there are gaps, or "structural holes," between regions. Some actors are in the position to bridge or span these gaps, giving rise to individual advantages relating to brokerage, gatekeeping, access to non-redundant contacts, and control over network flows. The most widely used measures of a given actor's bridging potential gauge the extent to which that actor is directly connected to others who are otherwise not well connected to each other. Unfortunately, the measures that have been developed to identify structural holes cannot be adapted directly to two-mode networks, like individual-to-organization networks. In two-mode networks, direct contacts cannot be directly connected to each other by definition, making the calculation of redundancy, effective size, and constraint impossible with conventional one-mode methods. We therefore describe a new framework for the measurement of bridging in two-mode networks that hinges on the mathematical concept of the intersection of sets. An actor in a given node class ("ego") has bridging potential to the extent that s/he is connected to actors in the opposite node class that have unique profiles of connections to actors in ego's own node class. We review the relevant literature pertaining to structural holes in two-mode networks, and we compare our primary bridging measure (effective size) to measures of bridging that result when using one-mode projections of two-mode data. We demonstrate the results of applying our approach to empirical data on the organizational affiliations of elites in a large U.S. city. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Drivers of hate speech in political conversations on Twitter: the case of the 2022 Italian general election</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-024-00501-1</url>
<snippet>We study the prevalence and characteristics of toxic speech on Twitter in the run-up to the 2022 Italian General election. We analyzed over 8.5 M tweets shared by 450k unique users and employed a machine learning classifier to estimate the toxicity score of their messages. We found that supporters of different political coalitions exhibit varying levels of toxic speech, sending between 6-8&#37; of toxic messages overall. Notably, Centre-Left politicians received more toxic messages on average, with the largest target of hate receiving over 15,000 toxic replies. We employed Generalized Linear Models to study factors that drive hate speech to political targets, finding that, importantly, politicians employing more abusive and harmful language are also more likely to attract more inflammatory speech. Our findings underscore the critical need for targeted interventions to address hate speech online, fostering healthier dialogue and safeguarding democratic discourse.

<title>Quantifying echo chamber effects in information spreading over political communication networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-019-0213-9</url>
<snippet>Echo chambers in online social networks, in which users prefer to interact only with ideologically-aligned peers, are believed to facilitate misinformation spreading and contribute to radicalize political discourse. In this paper, we gauge the effects of echo chambers in information spreading phenomena over political communication networks. Mining 12 million Twitter messages, we reconstruct a network in which users interchange opinions related to the impeachment of the former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. We define a continuous political leaning parameter, independent of the network's structure, that allows to quantify the presence of echo chambers in the strongly connected component of the network. These are reflected in two well-separated communities of similar sizes with opposite views of the impeachment process. By means of simple spreading models, we show that the capability of users in propagating the content they produce, measured by the associated spreading capacity, strongly depends on their attitude. Users expressing pro-impeachment leanings are capable to transmit information, on average, to a larger audience than users expressing anti-impeachment leanings. Furthermore, the users' spreading capacity is correlated to the diversity, in terms of political position, of the audience reached. Our method can be exploited to identify the presence of echo chambers and their effects across different contexts and shed light upon the mechanisms allowing to break echo chambers.

<title>Investigating the Relative Influence of Genes and Memes in Healthcare</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>The process by which genes and memes influence behaviour is poorly understood. Genes generally may have a strong influence as predispositions directing individuals towards certain behaviours; whereas memes may have a less direct influence as information inputs to cognitive processes determining behaviour. In certain areas of medical science, knowledge has progressed towards approximate quantification of genetic influences, while social psychology can provide models of mimetic influence as the spread of attitudes. This paper describes a computational model integration of genetic and mimetic influences in a healthcare domain. It models mimetic influences of advertising and health awareness messages in populations with genetic predispositions towards obesity; environmental variables influence both gene expression and mimetic force. Sensitivity analysis using the model with different population network structures is used to investigate the relative force of meme spread and influence.

<title>Network dynamics of social influence in the wisdom of crowds</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1615978114</url>
<snippet>A longstanding problem in the social, biological, and computational sciences is to determine how groups of distributed individuals can form intelligent collective judgments. Since Galton's discovery of the "wisdom of crowds" [Galton F (1907) Nature 75: 450-451], theories of collective intelligence have suggested that the accuracy of group judgments requires individuals to be either independent, with uncorrelated beliefs, or diverse, with negatively correlated beliefs [Page S (2008) The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies]. Previous experimental studies have supported this view by arguing that social influence undermines the wisdom of crowds. These results showed that individuals' estimates became more similar when subjects observed each other's beliefs, thereby reducing diversity without a corresponding increase in group accuracy [Lorenz J, Rauhut H, Schweitzer F, Helbing D (2011) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 108:9020-9025]. By contrast, we show general network conditions under which social influence improves the accuracy of group estimates, even as individual beliefs become more similar. We present theoretical predictions and experimental results showing that, in decentralized communication networks, group estimates become reliably more accurate as a result of information exchange. We further show that the dynamics of group accuracy change with network structure. In centralized networks, where the influence of central individuals dominates the collective estimation process, group estimates become more likely to increase in error.

<title>Breaking the Treadmill? Climate Change Policy Networks and the Prospects for Low Carbon Futures in Australia and Finland</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2020.1802540</url>
<snippet>The Treadmill of Production Theory (TPT) argues that in advanced capitalist societies, business organizations, trade unions, and state actors form a constellation that prioritizes economic growth over environmental concerns. We combine this perspective with the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) and use methods of social network analysis, survey data on key organizations in Finland and Australia, and in-depth interviews to map the policy network structures that resist low carbon transitions, and identify potential for change in these structures. We find that a coalition of economic, labor, and governmental organizations resists a low carbon transition in both countries. However, we also find several possible avenues of incremental change through changes in the network structures and the beliefs held by actors in the networks. Theoretically, this suggests that the TPT is correct in its diagnosis of the current situation, but the ACF may be a more fruitful perspective for identifying potential for change.

<title>Pathways to environmental activism in four countries: social media, environmental concern, and political efficacy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13676261.2021.2011845</url>
<snippet>In 2018-9, millions of youth participated in climate-related marches across the globe. This activism reflects youth's distinctive form of political participation: cause-oriented, expressive, and networked. However, the pathway between environmental concern and environmental activism is complicated in some contexts and for some citizens. This article uses survey data from four countries (Canada, France, the United Kingdom, the United States) gathered in autumn 2019. We focus on the environmental activism of youth and young adults (aged 18-33 years, n = 1574). We find the role of social media is consistent and strong for all environmental activities in all countries; the role of political efficacy depends on activity and country but has a positive role in environmental activism; and environmental concern is a positive and significant correlate of boycotting and signing petitions but a weak predictor of participating in environmental marches. The relationship between environmental concern and environmental marches is distinctive in the United Kingdom. Overall, we find that concern about a social cause does not automatically translate into increased activism related to that cause. Moreover, online social networks, political efficacy, and political context are critical to understanding this mobilization process.

<title>Modelling Multilevel Interdependencies for Resilience in Complex Organisation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/3946356</url>
<snippet>This paper aims to model multilevel interdependencies in complex organisational systems and proposes application for resilience analysis. Most of the existing research studied interdependencies only at the single-level and overlooked their multilevel character. In response to this gap, we propose a multilevel approach to better comprehend the complexity of interdependencies in organisational systems. More specifically, the study focuses on how interdependencies are shaped across multiple organisational levels. To understand the research problem, we use multilevel and social network theories to elaborate the concept at five organisational levels, namely, individual, intraunit, interunit, intraorganisational, and interorganisational. Further, we show the application of multilevel interdependencies into analysis of organisational resilience. To this end, we construct a multiplex model of a real world organisational system that comprises formal and informal relations of different social exchange strength. Using the agent-based simulations of the organisational system, we investigate the relations between organisational interdependencies and organisational performance in normal and disrupted conditions. With the results, we argue that managing multilevel interdependencies is crucial to reduce vulnerability of organisational systems. By introducing the multilevel conceptualisation of interdependencies and presenting their influence on organisational resilience, we hope to pave a path to managing the complexity of interdependencies and strategic resilience enhancement in organisational systems.

<title>Resilience and fragmentation in healthcare coalitions: The link between resource contributions and centrality in health-related interorganizational networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.07.004</url>
<snippet>Interorganizational coalitions or collaboratives in healthcare are essential to address the health challenges of local communities, particularly during crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic. However, few studies use large-scale data to systematically assess the network structure of these collaboratives and understand their potential to be resilient or fragment in the face of structural changes. This paper analyzes data collected in 2009-2017 about 817 organizations (nodes) in 42 healthcare collaboratives (networks) throughout Florida, the third-largest U.S. state by population, including information about interorganizational ties and organizations' resource contributions to their coalitions. Social network methods are used to characterize the resilience of these collaboratives, including identification of key players through various centrality metrics, analyses of fragmentation centrality and core/periphery structure, and Exponential Random Graph Models to examine how resource contributions facilitate interorganizational ties. Results show that the most significant resource contributions are made by key players identified through fragmentation centrality and by members of the network core. Departure or removal of these organizations would both strongly disrupt network structure and sever essential resource contributions, undermining the overall resilience of a collaborative. Furthermore, one-third of collaboratives are highly susceptible to disruption if any fragmentation-central organization is removed. More fragmented networks are also associated with poorer health-system outcomes in domains such as education, health policy, and services. ERGMs reveal that two types of resource contributions - community connections and in-kind resource sharing - are especially important to facilitate the formation of interorganizational ties in these coalitions.

<title>THE FLOW OF INFORMATION THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORKS - DIAGONAL-FREE MEASURES OF INEFFICIENCY AND THE STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS OF INEFFICIENCY</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-8733(94)90011-6</url>
<snippet>The aim of this paper is to (1) propose specific diagonal-free measures of the inefficiency of information flow through social networks and (2) present an analysis of the structural determinants of inefficiency. We employ a formal model of collective action developed by Coleman (1973, 1990); link it to the Markov model of interpersonal influence developed by among others French (1956), Harary (1959), and Friedkin (1991; Friedkin and Johnsen 1990); and extend it to measure inefficiency in information flow based on the concept of mean first passage times. It is shown that structural characteristics of social networks - such as global density, local density, diameter, number of bridges, and inequality in centrality, and certain interactions among these variables - strongly affect inefficiency. Theoretical implications of the results are discussed.

<title>The work and relatedness of ties mediated online in supporting long-term condition self-management</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9566.13042</url>
<snippet>The 'care transition' is characterised by reduced state involvement in chronic illness management in response to socio-political movements aimed at meeting the challenges presented by an increased prevalence of chronic illness. Amongst these changes has been online communities' rising importance in everyday interactions and attention is being increasingly paid towards the ways online contacts might contribute to self-management. Whilst research has illuminated the relevance of personal networks in long-term condition management, it is relevant to extend this work to consider the place of ties mediated online in this bricolage of support, including better understanding the work drawn from them and the strategies involved in eliciting it. This study examined the work and relatedness of 30 participants, who used online communities. Participants were asked about the role of on and offline ties and ego network mapping was used to frame conversations about the nature of this support. The context of engagement followed three main themes. Participants drew from online communities in response to deficits in offline support, they used online ties to leverage support or action from offline ties and they used online ties to substitute offline support, with less intimate online ties.

<snippet>GitHub has become the central online platform for much of open source, hosting most open source code repositories. With this popularity, the public digital traces of GitHub are now a valuable means to study teamwork and collaboration. In many ways, however, GitHub is a convenience sample, and may not be representative of open source development off the platform. Here we develop a novel, extensive sample of public open source project repositories outside of centralized platforms. We characterized these projects along a number of dimensions, and compare to a time-matched sample of corresponding GitHub projects. Our sample projects tend to have more collaborators, are maintained for longer periods, and tend to be more focused on academic and scientific problems.

<title>Structural effects of network sampling coverage I: Nodes missing at random</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2013.09.003</url>
<snippet>Network measures assume a census of a well-bounded population. This level of coverage is rarely achieved in practice, however, and we have only limited information on the robustness of network measures to incomplete coverage. This paper examines the effect of node-level missingness on 4 classes of network measures: centrality, centralization, topology and homophily across a diverse sample of 12 empirical networks. We use a Monte Carlo simulation process to generate data with known levels of missingness and compare the resulting network scores to their known starting values. As with past studies (Borgatti et al., 2006; Kossinets, 2006), we find that measurement bias generally increases with more missing data. The exact rate and nature of this increase, however, varies systematically across network measures. For example, betweenness and Bonacich centralization are quite sensitive to missing data while closeness and in-degree are robust. Similarly, while the tau statistic and distance are difficult to capture with missing data, transitivity shows little bias even with very high levels of missingness. The results are also clearly dependent on the features of the network. Larger, more centralized networks are generally more robust to missing data, but this is especially true for centrality and centralization measures. More cohesive networks are robust to missing data when measuring topological features but not when measuring centralization. Overall, the results suggest that missing data may have quite large or quite small effects on network measurement, depending on the type of network and the question being posed.

<title>Weibo network, information diffusion and implications for collective action in China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2013.853817</url>
<snippet>This study examines information diffusion and the follower network among a group of Sina Weibo users interested in homeowner associations. Using social network analysis techniques, this paper explores the network structure, the formation of follower relations and information diffusion. It reveals that micro-blogging is an important online platform because it can conveniently and inexpensively foster public online issue-networks beyond geographical boundaries. Specifically, Weibo has the potential to enable cross-province networking and communication, although geographical proximity is still at work; the trustworthiness of micro-blog users indirectly contributes to information diffusion by facilitating the formation of follower relations; and issue-specific follower networks facilitate information diffusion pertinent to the issue at stake. These findings suggest that micro-blogging services might have long-term effects on collective action by fostering issue-networks among civil society organizations or activists in different provinces.

<title>Abstract cognitive maps of social network structure aid adaptive inference</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2310801120</url>
<snippet>Social navigation-such as anticipating where gossip may spread, or identifying which acquaintances can help land a job-relies on knowing how people are connected within their larger social communities. Problematically, for most social networks, the space of possible relationships is too vast to observe and memorize. Indeed, people's knowledge of these social relations is well known to be biased and error- prone. Here, we reveal that these biased representations reflect a fundamental computation that abstracts over individual relationships to enable principled inferences about unseen relationships. We propose a theory of network representation that explains how people learn inferential cognitive maps of social relations from direct observation, what kinds of knowledge structures emerge as a consequence, and why it can be beneficial to encode systematic biases into social cognitive maps. Leveraging simulations, laboratory experiments, and "field data" from a real -world network, we find that people abstract observations of direct relations (e.g., friends) into inferences of multistep relations (e.g., friends - of- friends).This multistep abstraction mechanism enables people to discover and represent complex social network structure, affording adaptive inferences across a variety of contexts, includ-ing friendship, trust, and advice- giving. Moreover, this multistep abstraction mechanism unifies a variety of otherwise puzzling empirical observations about social behavior. Our proposal generalizes the theory of cognitive maps to the fundamental computational problem of social inference, presenting a powerful framework for understanding the workings of a predictive mind operating within a complex social world.SignificanceSuccessful navigation through our social communities-from identifying which "weak ties" can help land a job to deciding whether a friend -of - a- friendcan be trusted-necessitates that people build cognitive maps of how individuals are connected within a social network. Because our observations of others' relationships are noisy and incomplete, people need to fill gaps in relational knowledge by inferring the existence of unknown and unobserved relationships. Here, we demonstrate that predictive inferences emerge from a simple cognitive mechanism that abstracts observations of known friendships to multistep relations (e.g., friends - of- friends).This mechanism can parsimoniously explain how people infer a variety of social behaviors, like trust and advice- seeking.

<title>Network sampling coverage II: The effect of non-random missing data on network measurement</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2016.04.005</url>
<snippet>Missing data is an important, but often ignored, aspect of a network study. Measurement validity is affected by missing data, but the level of bias can be difficult to gauge. Here, we describe the effect of missing data on network measurement across widely different circumstances. In Part I of this study (Smith and Moody, 2013), we explored the effect of measurement bias due to randomly missing nodes. Here, we drop the assumption that data are missing at random: what happens to estimates of key network statistics when central nodes are more/less likely to be missing? We answer this question using a wide range of empirical networks and network measures. We find that bias is worse when more central nodes are missing. With respect to network measures, Bonacich centrality is highly sensitive to the loss of central nodes, while closeness centrality is not; distance and bicomponent size are more affected than triad summary measures and behavioral homophily is more robust than degree-homophily. With respect to types of networks, larger, directed networks tend to be more robust, but the relation is weak. We end the paper with a practical application, showing how researchers can use our results (translated into a publically available java application) to gauge the bias in their own data.

<title>The shaping of social and symbolic capital during the transition to farming in the Western Mediterranean: Archaeological network analyses of pottery decorations and personal ornaments</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0294111</url>
<snippet>Storing information and circulating it between individuals and groups is a critical behaviour that signals a tipping point in our evolutionary history. Such practices enabled the preservation and consolidation of knowledge over extended periods, facilitating the accumulation of cultural innovations across generations. In this study, we used Social Network Analysis methods to explore how knowledge circulated during the transition to agriculture in the Western Mediterranean region. Previous studies have shown that specific elements of the material culture reveal distinct patterns of cultural interaction among early farming communities. Here, we investigated if two archaeological proxies, personal ornaments and pottery decorations, both with an exclusively symbolic function, reveal different network structures, and if the different degree of connexions acted equally on the transmission of styles, symbols, and network changes over time. Our results relied on cultural data recorded from 77 archaeological occupations covering Italy, France, and Spain, spanning over 1,500 years (ca. 7950 similar to 6450 cal BP). By utilizing a chronological dataset comprising 114 radiocarbon dates, we revealed that pottery decorative techniques networks exhibited stronger connexions over space and time, with nodes organized in clear cluster, when compared to personal ornaments networks. The findings highlight the regionalization and fragmentation of cultural networks during the Early Neolithic, and that the transmission of cultural traits within each category of artefact operated through varying cultural and social mechanisms. Pottery expressed a dynamic regional identity, continuously shaped by geographical and chronological proximity, while bead-type associations contributed to enduring identities shared across vast geographical scales. These networks shed light on the multifaceted shaping of social and symbolic capital among the Mediterranean's early farmers, emphasizing the strength and quality of social ties that existed between communities and the level of reciprocity and cooperation required to foster these diverse social, economic, and cultural development strategies.

<title>Exploring Conservation Actor Networks in Trinidad And Tobago</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2022.2092668</url>
<snippet>Networks play an important role in conservation by facilitating and strengthening collaboration among conservation organizations. This study explores the structural characteristics of networks that could promote or inhibit conservation in Trinidad and Tobago. To achieve this, a questionnaire was sent out to all identifiable conservation actors on the island. Social network analysis software was used to analyze the data and generate network measures and maps. Results show that there are 69 conservation organizations on the island and NGOs play an important role. The overall network density and centralization are low while network cohesion across most categories of actor subgroups was positive. Ego network measures on centrality and brokerage were used to provide recommendations that could help to strengthen collaboration between organizations. As the first study of its kind using network analysis applied to conservation in this geographical context, it can help to inform future conservation research and initiatives.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-65986-2</url>
<snippet>Vaccine hesitancy is an inevitable risk for societies as it contributes to outbreaks of diseases. Prior research suggests that vaccination decisions of individuals tend to spread within social networks, resulting in a tendency to vaccination homophily. The clustering of individuals resistant to vaccination can substantially make the threshold necessary to achieve herd immunity harder to reach. In this study, we examined the extent of vaccination homophily among social contacts and its association with vaccine uptake during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary using a contact diary approach in two cross-sectional surveys. The results indicate strong clustering among both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. The most powerful predictor of vaccine uptake was the perceived vaccination rate within the egos' social contact network. Vaccination homophily and the role of the interpersonal contact network in vaccine uptake were particularly pronounced in the networks of close relationships, including family, kinship, and strong social ties of the ego. Our findings have important implications for understanding COVID-19 spread dynamics by showing that the strong clustering of unvaccinated individuals posed a great risk in preventing the spread of the disease.

<title>Homophily and prestige: An assessment of their relative strength to explain link formation in the online climate change debate</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.05.001</url>
<snippet>Previous work has shown that hyperlinks reflect actors' strategic choices; these dyadic relationships depend on the actors' exogenous attributes (e.g., homophily) and the network's endogenous features (e.g., prestige distribution among actors). We combine these factors as explanatory variables in different exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to assess the relative strength of prestige and homophily for the actors' link formation. We analyze the climate change discourse in a hyperlink network formed by US civil society actors from November 2014 and test how relevant the different factors are, including variables such as actor type, country, position, and topic. We find that both prestige and various aspects of homophily influence link formation online. With regard to the importance of the different factors, positional homophily stands out, followed by prestige and other homophily effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Practical Methods for Imputing Follower Count Dynamics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0049124120926210</url>
<snippet>Microblogging sites have become important data sources for studying network dynamics and information transmission. Both areas of study, however, require accurate counts of indegree, or follower counts; unfortunately, collection of complete time series on follower counts can be limited by application programming interface constraints, system failures, or temporal constraints. In addition, there is almost always a time difference between the point at which follower counts are queried and the time a user posts a tweet. Here, we consider the use of three classes of simple, easily implemented methods for follower imputation: polynomial functions, splines, and generalized linear models. We evaluate the performance of each method via a case study of accounts from 236 health organizations during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. For accurate interpolation and extrapolation, we find that negative binomial regression, modeled separately for each account, using time as an interval variable, accurately recovers missing values while retaining narrow prediction intervals.

<title>Beyond collective intelligence: Collective adaptation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2022.0736</url>
<snippet>We develop a conceptual framework for studying collective adaptation in complex socio-cognitive systems, driven by dynamic interactions of social integration strategies, social environments and problem structures. Going beyond searching for 'intelligent' collectives, we integrate research from different disciplines and outline modelling approaches that can be used to begin answering questions such as why collectives sometimes fail to reach seemingly obvious solutions, how they change their strategies and network structures in response to different problems and how we can anticipate and perhaps change future harmful societal trajectories. We discuss the importance of considering path dependence, lack of optimization and collective myopia to understand the sometimes counterintuitive outcomes of collective adaptation. We call for a transdisciplinary, quantitative and societally useful social science that can help us to understand our rapidly changing and ever more complex societies, avoid collective disasters and reach the full potential of our ability to organize in adaptive collectives.

<title>Identification of influencers in online social networks: measuring influence considering multidimensional factors exploration</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06472</url>
<snippet>Online Social networks exhibit heterogeneous nature with nodes playing far different roles in structure and function. To identify influencers is thus very significant, allowing us to control the outbreak of public negative opinion, to conduct advertisements for e-commercial products, to predict popular scientific publications, and so on. The identification of influencers attracts increasing attentions from both computer science and communication science, with multiple dimensional metrics ranging from structure-based to information-based and action-based. However, most work simply rely on one dimensional metrics. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze three dimensional characteristics (structure-based, information-based, and action-based factors) to develop the multi-dimensional social influence (MSI) measurement approach. With topic distillation and conditional expectation, the MSI approach can not only measure users topic-level influence, but also measure users global-level influence. Based on data collected from SinaWeibo.com, the experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms two traditional methods (LeaderRank and FBI) both on the topic-level and the global-level. The proposed framework can be effectively applied to promote word-of-mouth marketing, and to steer public opinion in certain directions, even to support decisions during a negotiation process.

<title>Neighborhood co-offending networks, structural embeddedness, and violent crime in Chicago</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2016.12.003</url>
<snippet>Neighborhood disparities in crime are a persistent feature of U.S. cities. Scholars have documented that both local structural conditions and characteristics of spatially proximate communities influence neigh-borhood crime rates. Previous studies on neighborhood inequality in crime, however, are limited by their focus on identifying average spillover effects between pairs of spatially contiguous neighborhoods, and have neglected to consider how the broader social organization of the city influences local outcomes. This study examines the role of neighborhood-level criminal networks in shaping the distribution of crime throughout cities. Employing arrest records and survey data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, we construct a neighborhood-level co-offending network for Chicago for 2001. We use this network to investigate how a focal neighborhood's homicide rate is influenced by its structural embeddedness within the larger inter -neighborhood co-offending network. Results indicate that a neighborhood's embeddedness increases the local homicide rate, even after controlling for the neighborhood's internal propensity toward crime and accounting for unobserved spatial processes.

<title>Extremists of a feather flock together? Community structures, transitivity, and patterns of homophily in the US Islamist co-offending network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0298273</url>
<snippet>Prior research suggests that members of terrorist groups prioritize forming network ties based on trust to improve their organizational and operational security. The homophily principle, which postulates that individuals tend to form relationships based on shared characteristics, can be a key mechanism through which people identify trustworthy associates. Next to homophily, the mechanism of establishing interconnected relationships through transitivity is also well-known to serve this purpose and shape community structures in social networks. We analyze the community structures of the Islamist co-offending network in the United States, which is highly violent, to assess whether homophily and transitivity determine which extremists form co-offending ties. We rely on a new database on the individual attributes and the co-offending relationships of 494 Islamist offenders radicalized in the United States between 1993 and 2020. Using community detection algorithms, we show that the US Islamist co-offending network is highly clustered, modular, and includes many small but only a few large communities. Furthermore, results from exponential random graph modeling show that transitive relationships as well as spatial proximity, ideological affiliation, and shared socio-cultural characteristics drive co-offending among US Islamist extremists. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the processes of homophily and transitivity shape violent social networks.

<title>Network-based diffusion analysis reveals context-specific dominance of dance communication in foraging honeybees</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14410-0</url>
<snippet>The honeybee (Apis mellifera) dance communication system is a marvel of collective behaviour, but the added value it brings to colony foraging efficiency is poorly understood. In temperate environments, preventing communication of foraging locations rarely decreases colony food intake, potentially because simultaneous transmission of olfactory information also plays a major role in foraging. Here, we employ social network analyses that quantify information flow across multiple temporally varying networks (each representing a different interaction type) to evaluate the relative contributions of dance communication and hive-based olfactory information transfer to honeybee recruitment events. We show that virtually all successful recruits to novel locations rely upon dance information rather than olfactory cues that could otherwise guide them to the same resource. Conversely, during reactivation to known sites, dances are relatively less important, as foragers are primarily guided by olfactory information. By disentangling the contributions of multiple information networks, the contexts in which dance communication truly matters amid a complex system full of redundancy can now be identified. Honeybees have a sophisticated system to communicate foraging locations through a "dance", but they also share food-related olfactory cues. Here, Hasenjager and colleagues use social network analysis to disentangle how foraging information is transmitted through these systems in different contexts.

<title>Selectivity in posting on social networks: the role of privacy concerns, social capital, and technical literacy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03298</url>
<snippet>People's posting behaviors in social networks was perceived as ambiguous, with concerns misaligned with people's public postings. To address this gap, we suggest a model that offers new insights into the relationship between perceptions and actual behaviors. We define a quantitative marker for agility, the frequency in which people update their audience selection when posting information in online social networks, and evaluate the factors that contribute to the variability of agility between different users. We analyzed the posting behavior of Facebook 181 participants, as well as their answers to open and close questions. We find that frequent changes in privacy settings are correlated with high social privacy and with institutional privacy concerns, whereas social concerns were found to be more prominent. Agility was negatively correlated with low public sharing. Our findings show that users use privacy settings to effectively mitigate privacy concerns and desires for creating and strengthening social connections. We discuss how agility can be used to design and to evaluate new user interfaces for managing privacy in social settings.

<title>Mapping social dynamics on Facebook: The Brexit debate</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2017.02.002</url>
<snippet>Nowadays users get informed and shape their opinion through social media. However, the disintermediated access to contents does not guarantee quality of information. Selective exposure and confirmation bias, indeed, have been shown to play a pivotal role in content consumption and information spreading. Users tend to select information adhering (and reinforcing) their worldview and to ignore dissenting information. This pattern elicits the formation of polarized groups - i.e., echo chambers where the interaction with like-minded people might even reinforce polarization. In this work we address news consumption around Brexit in UK on Facebook. In particular, we perform a massive analysis on more than I million users interacting with Brexit related posts from the main news providers between January and July 2016. We show that consumption patterns elicit the emergence of two distinct communities of news outlets. Furthermore, to better characterize inner group dynamics, we introduce a new technique which combines automatic topic extraction and sentiment analysis. We compare how the same topics are presented on posts and the related emotional response on comments finding significant differences in both echo chambers and that polarization influences the perception of topics. Our results provide important insights about the determinants of polarization and evolution of core narratives on online debating. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>The influence of gender ratios on academic careers: Combining social networks with tokenism</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207337</url>
<snippet>This paper examines how gender proportions at the workplace affect the extent to which individual networks support the career progress (i.e. time to promotion). Previous studies have argued that men and women benefit from different network structures. However, the empirical evidence about these differences has been contradictory or inconclusive at best. Combining social networks with tokenism, we show in a longitudinal academic study that gender-related differences in the way that networks affect career progress exist only in situations where women are in a token position. Our empirical results further show that women not in severely underrepresented situations benefit from the same network structure as men.

<title>Can social network analysis contribute to supply chain management? A systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e26598</url>
<snippet>Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a modeling technique and analytical approach well-suited for identifying and examining the structural features of supply networks and the patterns of connections between members within the network. This paper aims to present a systematic review and bibliometric analysis by investigating network structural properties and metrics in supply chain management (SCM) research. The approach involved combining a systematic literature review with a bibliometric analysis, forming a two-part methodology to examine 113 articles published between 2008 and 2023 in 62 journals. Our systematic thematic analysis reveals how SCM researchers have applied SNA techniques in terms of the reported node-level and networklevel structural metrics, including network configuration description metrics, centrality measures, supply network subgroups, and models of supply network structure and formation. We identify the gaps in the existing body of literature and propose potential directions for future research. By quantitatively analyzing, classifying, and visualizing bibliographic data of previous studies, this paper provides further insights into the application of network structural properties in SCM research. Furthermore, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the significance of the supply network's relational structure and configuration. Considering the disruptions to global supply chains caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russo-Ukrainian War, our findings can contribute to a better understanding of strategic supply network design.

<title>Collective aspects of privacy in the Twitter social network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0130-3</url>
<snippet>Preserving individual control over private information is one of the rising concerns in our digital society. Online social networks exist in application ecosystems that allow them to access data from other services, for example gathering contact lists through mobile phone applications. Such data access might allow social networking sites to create shadow profiles with information about non-users that has been inferred from information shared by the users of the social network. This possibility motivates the shadow profile hypothesis: the data shared by the users of an online service predicts personal information of non-users of the service. We test this hypothesis for the first time on Twitter, constructing a dataset of users that includes profile biographical text, location information, and bidirectional friendship links. We evaluate the predictability of the location of a user by using only information given by friends of the user that joined Twitter before the user did. This way, we audit the historical prediction power of Twitter data for users that had not joined Twitter yet. Our results indicate that information shared by users in Twitter can be predictive of the location of individuals outside Twitter. Furthermore, we observe that the quality of this prediction increases with the tendency of Twitter users to share their mobile phone contacts and is more accurate for individuals with more contacts inside Twitter. We further explore the predictability of biographical information of non-users, finding evidence in line with our results for locations. These findings illustrate that individuals are not in full control of their online privacy and that sharing personal data with a social networking site is a decision that is collectively mediated by the decisions of others.

<title>Cumulative Dynamics of Independent Information Spreading Behaviour: A Physical Perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-05899-5</url>
<snippet>The popularization of information spreading in online social networks facilitates daily communication among people. Although much work has been done to study the effect of interactions among people on spreading, there is less work that considers the pattern of spreading behaviour when people independently make their decisions. By comparing microblogging, an important medium for information spreading, with the disordered spin glass system, we find that there exist interesting corresponding relationships between them. And the effect of aging can be observed in both systems. Based on the analogy with the Trap Model of spin glasses, we derive a model with a unified powerfunction form for the growth of independent spreading activities. Our model takes several key factors into consideration, including memory effect, the dynamics of human interest, and the fact that older messages are more difficult to discover. We validate our model by a real-world microblogging data set. Our work indicates that, other than various features, some invariable rules should be considered during spreading prediction. This work also contributes a useful methodology for studying human dynamics.

<title>The gender of social capital</title>

<snippet>Legitimacy affects returns to social capital. I begin with the network structure of social capital, explaining the information and control benefits of structural holes. The holes in a network are entrepreneurial opportunities to add value, and persons rich in such opportunities are expected to be more successful than their peers. Accumulating empirical research supports the prediction. However, women here pose a puzzle. The entrepreneurial networks linked to early promotion for senior men do not work for women. Solving the gender puzzle is an occasion to see how network models of social capital can be used to identify people not accepted as legitimate members of a population, and to describe how such people get access to social capital by borrowing the network of a strategic partner.

<title>A NOVEL MODEL FOR RUMOR SPREADING ON SOCIAL NETWORKS WITH CONSIDERING THE INFLUENCE OF DISSENTING OPINIONS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S021952591850011X</url>
<snippet>Rumor spreading is a good sample of spreading in which human beings are the main players in the spreading process. Therefore, in order to have a more realistic model of rumor spreading on online social networks, the influence of psycho-sociological factors particularly those which affect users' reactions toward rumor/anti-rumor should be considered. To this aim, we present a new model that considers the influence of dissenting opinions on those users who have already believed in rumor/anti-rumor but have not spread the rumor/anti-rumor yet. We hypothesize that influence is a motive for the believers to spread their beliefs in rumor/anti-rumor. We derive the stochastic equations of the new model and evaluate it by using two real datasets of rumor spreading on Twitter. The evaluation results support the new hypothesis and show that the novel model which is relied on the new hypothesis is able to better represent rumor spreading.

<title>What Tweets and YouTube comments have in common? Sentiment and graph analysis on data related to US elections 2020</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270542</url>
<snippet>Most studies analyzing political traffic on Social Networks focus on a single platform, while campaigns and reactions to political events produce interactions across different social media. Ignoring such cross-platform traffic may lead to analytical errors, missing important interactions across social media that e.g. explain the cause of trending or viral discussions. This work links Twitter and YouTube social networks using cross-postings of video URLs on Twitter to discover the main tendencies and preferences of the electorate, distinguish users and communities' favouritism towards an ideology or candidate, study the sentiment towards candidates and political events, and measure political homophily. This study shows that Twitter communities correlate with YouTube comment communities: that is, Twitter users belonging to the same community in the Retweet graph tend to post YouTube video links with comments from YouTube users belonging to the same community in the YouTube Comment graph. Specifically, we identify Twitter and YouTube communities, we measure their similarity and differences and show the interactions and the correlation between the largest communities on YouTube and Twitter. To achieve that, we have gather a dataset of approximately 20M tweets and the comments of 29K YouTube videos; we present the volume, the sentiment, and the communities formed in YouTube and Twitter graphs, and publish a representative sample of the dataset, as allowed by the corresponding Twitter policy restrictions.

<title>Vaccination strategies against COVID-19 and the diffusion of anti-vaccination views</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85555-1</url>
<snippet>Misinformation is usually adjusted to fit distinct narratives and propagates rapidly through social networks. False beliefs, once adopted, are rarely corrected. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, pandemic-deniers and people who oppose wearing face masks or quarantine have already been a substantial aspect of the development of the pandemic. With the vaccine for COVID-19, different anti-vaccine narratives are being created and are probably being adopted by large population groups with critical consequences. Assuming full adherence to vaccine administration, we use a diffusion model to analyse epidemic spreading and the impact of different vaccination strategies, measured with the average years of life lost, in three network topologies (a proximity, a scale-free and a small-world network). Then, using a similar diffusion model, we consider the spread of anti-vaccine views in the network, which are adopted based on a persuasiveness parameter of anti-vaccine views. Results show that even if anti-vaccine narratives have a small persuasiveness, a large part of the population will be rapidly exposed to them. Assuming that all individuals are equally likely to adopt anti-vaccine views after being exposed, more central nodes in the network, which are more exposed to these views, are more likely to adopt them. Comparing years of life lost, anti-vaccine views could have a significant cost not only on those who share them, since the core social benefits of a limited vaccination strategy (reduction of susceptible hosts, network disruptions and slowing the spread of the disease) are substantially shortened.

<title>The lives of others: Class divisions, network segregation, and attachment to society in Chile</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-4446.12966</url>
<snippet>In this paper, we examine whether social class and class divides in social networks contribute to individuals' attachment to society. We argue that network segregation restricts individuals' social worlds, thereby diminishing societal attachment. Our research site is Chile, a country with relatively low social cohesion and one of the world's highest levels of economic inequality. We use large-scale representative survey data collected in 2016 for the Chilean urban population aged 18-75 years (n = 2983) and interrelate indicators of well-established dimensions and sub-dimensions of societal attachment. Results of our regression analyses show that members of the upper middle class are more attached to society than their fellow citizens from other social strata. In addition, having more social contacts within one's own social class reduces attachment to society. In particular, network homogeneity lessens societal attachment for lower- and upper-class individuals, but not so strongly in the middle class. We conclude that social cohesion in Chilean society would be enhanced not only by more equal opportunities but also by changes to the social settings in which social class segregation is (re)produced.

<title>Information-theoretic models of deception: Modelling cooperation and diffusion in populations exposed to "fake news"</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207383</url>
<snippet>The modelling of deceptions in game theory and decision theory has not been well studied, despite the increasing importance of this problem in social media, public discourse, and organisational management. This paper presents an improved formulation of the extant information-theoretic models of deceptions, a framework for incorporating these models of deception into game and decision theoretic models of deception, and applies these models and this framework in an agent based evolutionary simulation that models two very common deception types employed in "fake news" attacks. The simulation results for both deception types modelled show, as observed empirically in many social systems subjected to "fake news" attacks, that even a very small population of deceivers that transiently invades a much larger population of non-deceiving agents can strongly alter the equilibrium behaviour of the population in favour of agents playing an always defect strategy. The results also show that the ability of a population of deceivers to establish itself or remain present in a population is highly sensitive to the cost of the deception, as this cost reduces the fitness of deceiving agents when competing against non-deceiving agents. Diffusion behaviours observed for agents exploiting the deception producing false beliefs are very close to empirically observed behaviours in social media, when fitted to epidemiological models. We thus demonstrate, using the improved formulation of the information-theoretic models of deception, that agent based evolutionary simulations employing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma can accurately capture the behaviours of a population subject to deception attacks introducing uncertainty and false perceptions, and show that information-theoretic models of deception have practical applications beyond trivial taxonomical analysis.

<title>Correlated genotypes in friendship networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1011687108</url>
<snippet>It is well known that humans tend to associate with other humans who have similar characteristics, but it is unclear whether this tendency has consequences for the distribution of genotypes in a population. Although geneticists have shown that populations tend to stratify genetically, this process results from geographic sorting or assortative mating, and it is unknown whether genotypes may be correlated as a consequence of nonreproductive associations or other processes. Here, we study six available genotypes from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to test for genetic similarity between friends. Maps of the friendship networks show clustering of genotypes and, after we apply strict controls for population stratification, the results show that one genotype is positively correlated (homophily) and one genotype is negatively correlated (heterophily). A replication study in an independent sample from the Framingham Heart Study verifies that DRD2 exhibits significant homophily and that CYP2A6 exhibits significant heterophily. These unique results show that homophily and heterophily obtain on a genetic (indeed, an allelic) level, which has implications for the study of population genetics and social behavior. In particular, the results suggest that association tests should include friends' genes and that theories of evolution should take into account the fact that humans might, in some sense, be metagenomic with respect to the humans around them.

<title>Social threat learning transfers to decision making in humans</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1810180116</url>
<snippet>In today's world, mass-media and online social networks present us with unprecedented exposure to second-hand, vicarious experiences and thereby the chance of forming associations between previously innocuous events (e.g., being in a subway station) and aversive outcomes (e.g., footage or verbal reports from a violent terrorist attack) without direct experience. Such social threat, or fear, learning can have dramatic consequences, as manifested in acute stress symptoms and maladaptive fears. However, most research has so far focused on socially acquired threat responses that are expressed as increased arousal rather than active behavior. In three experiments (n = 120), we examined the effect of indirect experiences on behaviors by establishing a link between social threat learning and instrumental decision making. We contrasted learning from direct experience (i.e., Pavlovian conditioning) (experiment 1) against two common forms of social threat learning-social observation (experiment 2) and verbal instruction (experiment 3)-and how this learning transferred to subsequent instrumental decision making using behavioral experiments and computational modeling. We found that both types of social threat learning transfer to decision making in a strong and surprisingly inflexible manner. Notably, computational modeling indicated that the transfer of observational and instructed threat learning involved different computational mechanisms. Our results demonstrate the strong influence of others' expressions of fear on one's own decisions and have important implications for understanding both healthy and pathological human behaviors resulting from the indirect exposure to threatening events.

<title>It takes two: A dyadic model of recruitment to civic activity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.07.008</url>
<snippet>Why are some people, but not others, asked to engage in civic activity? Rather than focus on the personal traits of either potential recruits or recruiters for this initial stage of recruitment, we develop and test a theoretical framework that emphasizes the importance of shared relationships and characteristics between those doing the recruiting and those being recruited. Specifically, the nature of interactions, overlapping community and associational space, status and value homophily, and strength and intimacy are assessed to explain differential recruitment among people's closest ties. Furthermore, unlike previous studies, we do so across three different forms of civic activity blood donation, volunteer work, and political activism allowing us to identify larger patterns in civic solicitation. Results from multilevel analyses of dyads reorganized from ego-centric data of U.S. adults show that while certain personal traits of egos and alters remain significant, attributes of the dyad are equally, if not more, consequential for explaining variation in who gets asked to participate in civic activity. Importantly, while certain dyadic characteristics such as romantic partnerships promote recruitment to all three forms of civic activity, the effects of others such as sex homophily are unique to specific forms. Broadly speaking, our results indicate that some types of dyadic characteristics are more powerful than others and that there are important differences in how particular dimensions of social connections shape recruitment efforts across the specific activities of donating blood, volunteering time, and engaging in political activism.

<title>The importance of neighborhood offending networks for gun violence and firearm availability</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/soae099</url>
<snippet>The salience of neighborhoods in shaping crime patterns is one of sociology's most robust areas of research. One way through which neighborhoods shape outcomes is through the creation and maintenance of social networks, patterns of interactions and relationships among neighborhood residents, organizations, groups, and institutions. This paper explores the relationship between network structures generated through acts of co-offending-when two or more individuals engage in an alleged crime together-and patterns of neighborhood gun violence and gun availability. Using arrest data from New York City, we create co-arrest networks between individuals arrested in the city between 2010 and 2015. We analyze these network patterns to, first, understand the overall structure of co-offending networks and, then, assess how they impact neighborhood levels of gun violence and gun availability. Results show that local and extra-local networks play a central role in predicting neighborhood levels of shootings: neighborhoods with a greater density of local ties have higher shootings rates, and neighborhoods that share social ties have similar rates of violence. In contrast, the network dynamics involved in gun recoveries are almost entirely local: co-offending patterns within neighborhoods are strongly associated with the level of gun recoveries, especially the clustering of co-offending networks indicative of groups. Contrary to previous research, spatial autocorrelation failed to predict either shootings or gun recoveries when demographic features were considered. Social-demographic characteristics seem to explain much of the observed spatial autocorrelation and the precise measurement of network properties might provide better measurements of the neighborhood dynamics involved in urban gun violence.

<title>Seed Selection Strategies for Information Diffusion in Social Networks: An Agent-Based Model Applied to Rural Zambia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4429</url>
<snippet>The successful adoption of innovations depends on the provision of adequate information to farmers. In rural areas of developing countries, farmers usually rely on their social networks as an information source. Hence, policy-makers and program-implementers can benefit fromsocial diffusion processes to effectively disseminate information. This study aims to identify the set of farmers who initially obtain information ('seeds') that optimises diffusion through the network. It systematically evaluates different criteria for seed selection, number of seeds, and their interaction effects. An empirical Agent-Based Model adjusted to a case study in rural Zambia was applied to predict diffusion outcomes for varying seed sets ex ante. Simulations revealed that informing farmers with the most connections leads to highest diffusion speed and reach. Also targeting village heads and farmers with high betweenness centrality, who function as bridges connecting different parts of the network, enhances diffusion. An increased number of seeds improves reach, but the marginal effects of additional seeds decline. Interdependencies between seed set size and selection criteria highlight the importance of considering both seed selection criteria and seed set size for optimising seeding strategies to enhance information diffusion.

<title>Intervention Strategies and the Diffusion of Collective Behavior</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.2872</url>
<snippet>This paper examines the intervention strategies for the diffusion of collective behavior, such as promoting innovation adoption and repressing a strike. An intervention strategy refers to controlling the behaviors of a small number of individuals in terms of their social or personal attributes, including connectivity (i.e., the number of social ties one holds), motivation (i.e., an individual's intrinsic cost-benefit judgment on behavior change), and sensitivity (i.e., the degree to which one follows others). Extensive agent-based simulations demonstrate that the optimal strategy fundamentally depends on the goal and time of intervention. Moreover, the nature of the social network (determined by homophily type and level) moderates the effectiveness of a strategy. These results have substantial implications for the design and evaluation of intervention programs.

<title>You are who your friends are? An experiment on homophily in trustworthiness among friends</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1043463120919380</url>
<snippet>We study the existence of homophily (i.e. the tendency for people to be friends with people who are similar to themselves) with respect to trustworthiness. We ask whether two friends show similarly trustworthy behavior toward strangers, and whether such behavior is expected by a third party. We develop a simple model of Bayesian learning in trust games and test the derived hypotheses in a controlled laboratory environment. In the experiment, two trustees sequentially play a trust game with the same trustor, where the trustees depending on treatment are either friends or strangers to each other. We confirm the existence of homophily with respect to trustworthiness. The trustors' beliefs about the trustees' trustfulness are not affected by the knowledge about the (non-)existent friendship between the trustees. Behaviorally, however, they indirectly reciprocate the (un-)trustworthy behavior of one trustee toward his or her friends in later interactions.

<snippet>The relationship between social networks and health encompasses everything from the flow of pathogens and information to the diffusion of beliefs and behaviors. This review addresses the vast and multidisciplinary literature that studies social networks as a structural determinant of health. In particular, we report on the current state of knowledge on how social contagion dynamics influence individual and collective health outcomes. We pay specific attention to research that leverages large-scale online data and social network experiments to empirically identify three broad classes of contagion processes: pathogenic diffusion, informational and belief diffusion, and behavioral diffusion. We conclude by identifying the need for more research on (a) how multiple contagions interact within the same social network, (b) how online social networks impact offline health, and

<title>Detection Framework for Content-Based Cybercrime in Online Social Networks Using Metaheuristic Approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13369-019-04125-w</url>
<snippet>In recent years, content-based cybercrime detection has become a topic of attraction among researchers. Cybercrime has emerged as a money-driven industry with malicious intent towards online social networks. Cyber-criminals aim to manipulate vulnerable areas in cyberspace by playing on human understanding and making a profit. They threaten minors, especially adolescents, who are not adequately overseen while online. To address this issue, there is an urgent need for a robust content-based cybercrime detection framework. The aim of this research work is to explore possible combinations of various preprocessing, feature selection and classification methodologies using the cuckoo search metaheuristic approach. This approach seeks to improve the performance of content-based cybercrime detection system. For the purpose of this research, four publicly available datasets for cyberbullying detection have been utilized for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm was then further compared with three recent cyberbullying detection models based on various evaluation parameters. These parameters included precision, recall and f-measure. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This approach outperformed other recent techniques on all the datasets, giving high predictive recall value via tenfold cross-validation.

<title>Fishing Nets between Two Seas: Guilds and Ship-Owner Associations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean Fishing Grounds of Andalusia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.5477/cis/reis.155.113</url>
<snippet>This study examines the organizational network of the extractive sector in Andalusian fishing enclaves. For this, we have evaluated 6 types of informal and institutional relationships between a total of 30 guilds and ship-owner associations in 21 Andalusian fishing ports. The analyzed networks were found to have a core-periphery structure with the guilds playing a central role. The QAP procedure was used to identify two distinct contexts of relationship formation: informal meetings and the government fishing network (corresponding to formal meetings, such as fishing tables, port assemblies and fishing quota negotiations). We verified the existence of significant homophily dynamics based on both fishing ground and organization type.

<title>The effects of Internet use on adolescents' first romantic and sexual relationships in Taiwan</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0268580914538084</url>
<snippet>Internet use and digital networking are increasingly an integral part of adolescents' social lives. This study examines the influences of Internet use in Taiwan on two important adolescent social behaviors: first romantic relationship and sexual debut. Using data from the Taiwan Youth Project (TYP), 2000-2009, the results of event history analyses suggest that adolescents' Internet use for educational purposes reduces the rates of having a first romantic relationship and a sexual debut in adolescence, whereas using the Internet for social networking, visiting internet cafes, and surfing pornographic websites increase the rates. There are gender differences in the effects of these Internet activities on adolescents' intimate experiences. Logistic analyses further show that Internet activities also affect the likelihood of whether adolescents have a sexual debut before a first romantic relationship. The implications of these findings are discussed in the conclusion.

<title>Gender-specific homophily on Instagram and implications on information spread</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-51117-w</url>
<snippet>More and more social interactions happen online. On online social networks such as Instagram, millions of users share, like, and comment on photos and videos every day, interacting with other users world wide, at large scale and at a high rate. These networks do not only introduce new user experiences, but they also enable new insights into human behavior. Here, we use these new possibilities to study homophilic behavior-the tendency of individuals to bond with people similar to themselves. While homophilic behavior has been observed in many contexts, little is known about gender-specific differences and the extent of homophilic behavior of female and male users in online social networks. Based on a unique and extensive data set, covering over 800,000 (directed) Instagram interactions and a time span of three years, we shed light on differences between genders and uncover an intriguing asymmetry of homophily. In particular, we show that female users exhibit homophily to a larger extent than male users. The magnitude of this asymmetry depends on the type of interaction, as differences are more pronounced for 'comment'-interactions than for 'like'-interactions. Given these empirical observations, we further study the implications of such gender differences on the spread of information in social networks in a basic model. We find that on average, a piece of information that originates from a female group reaches significantly more female users than male users.

<title>Predicting and explaining behavioral data with structured feature space decomposition</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-019-0201-0</url>
<snippet>Modeling human behavioral data is challenging due to its scale, sparseness (few observations per individual), heterogeneity (differently behaving individuals), and class imbalance (few observations of the outcome of interest). An additional challenge is learning an interpretable model that not only accurately predicts outcomes, but also identifies important factors associated with a given behavior. To address these challenges, we describe a statistical approach to modeling behavioral data called the structured sum-of-squares decomposition (S3D). The algorithm, which is inspired by decision trees, selects important features that collectively explain the variation of the outcome, quantifies correlations between the features, and bins the subspace of important features into smaller, more homogeneous blocks that correspond to similarly-behaving subgroups within the population. This partitioned subspace allows us to predict and analyze the behavior of the outcome variable both statistically and visually, giving a medium to examine the effect of various features and to create explainable predictions. We apply S3D to learn models of online activity from large-scale data collected from diverse sites, such as Stack Exchange, Khan Academy, Twitter, Duolingo, and Digg. We show that S3D creates parsimonious models that can predict outcomes in the held-out data at levels comparable to state-of-the-art approaches, but in addition, produces interpretable models that provide insights into behaviors. This is important for informing strategies aimed at changing behavior, designing social systems, but also for explaining predictions, a critical step towards minimizing algorithmic bias.

<title>Structural characteristics and proximity comparison of China's urban innovation cooperation network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255443</url>
<snippet>How to promote and improve the level of urban innovation cooperation is a major issue in China's current high-quality economic development. Thus, enhancing innovation ability is essential to achieving high-quality economic growth under the "new normal". Based on the data of Chinese invention patents from 1985 to 2017, this paper analyzes the characteristics of China's urban innovation cooperation network and the different roles of proximity by using social network analysis and exploratory spatial data analysis methods. The analysis results show that: (1) On the whole, the development of China's urban innovation cooperation network is characterized by stages (initial development stage, rapid development stage, and gradual decline stage); The urban innovation cooperation network has strong connectivity and centripetal concentration but its imbalance needs to be further improved; The degree of urban participation has gradually increased, consolidating the stability of the network structure. (2) The centrality of urban innovation cooperation network has obvious characteristics of administrative center orientation, coastal areas orientation, and 'strong east and weak west'; Beijing is the center and bridge of the network, and the network flattening characteristics are obvious; A hierarchical 'core-edge' structure is gradually formed for the urban innovation cooperation network, and the pyramid structure with Beijing standing at the top is being consolidated. (3) The geographical proximity presents a significant global spatial positive correlation, while the network proximity and pure network proximity have a more significant global spatial negative correlation; The local spatial autocorrelation of China's urban innovation cooperation system based on network proximity is more obvious and identifiable than that based on the geographical proximity, which better reflects the new development model of "relationship economy".

<title>Protecting infrastructure performance from disinformation attacks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16832-w</url>
<snippet>Disinformation campaigns are prevalent, affecting vaccination coverage, creating uncertainty in election results, and causing supply chain disruptions, among others. Unfortunately, the problems of misinformation and disinformation are exacerbated due to the wide availability of online platforms and social networks. Naturally, these emerging disinformation networks could lead users to engage with critical infrastructure systems in harmful ways, leading to broader adverse impacts. One such example involves the spread of false pricing information, which causes drastic and sudden changes in user commodity consumption behavior, leading to shortages. Given this, it is critical to address the following related questions: (i) How can we monitor the evolution of disinformation dissemination and its projected impacts on commodity consumption? (ii) What effects do the mitigation efforts of human intermediaries have on the performance of the infrastructure network subject to disinformation campaigns? (iii) How can we manage infrastructure network operations and counter disinformation in concert to avoid shortages and satisfy user demands? To answer these questions, we develop a hybrid approach that integrates an epidemiological model of disinformation spread (based on a susceptible-infectious-recovered model, or SIR) with an efficient mixed-integer programming optimization model for infrastructure network performance. The goal of the optimization model is to determine the best protection and response actions against disinformation to minimize the general shortage of commodities at different nodes over time. The proposed model is illustrated with a case study involving a subset of the western US interconnection grid located in Los Angeles County in California.

<title>Offline biases in online platforms: a study of diversity and homophily in Airbnb</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-019-0189-5</url>
<snippet>How diverse are sharing economy platforms? Are they fair marketplaces, where all participants operate on a level playing field, or are they large-scale online aggregators of offline human biases? Often portrayed as easy-to-access digital spaces whose participants receive equal opportunities, such platforms have recently come under fire due to reports of discriminatory behaviours among their users, and have been associated with gentrification phenomena that exacerbate preexisting inequalities along racial lines. In this paper, we focus on the Airbnb sharing economy platform, and analyse the diversity of its user base across five large cities. We find it to be predominantly young, female, and white. Notably, we find this to be true even in cities with a diverse racial composition. We then introduce a method based on the statistical analysis of networks to quantify behaviours of homophily, heterophily and avoidance between Airbnb hosts and guests. Depending on cities and property types, we do find signals of such behaviours relating both to race and gender. We use these findings to provide platform design recommendations, aimed at exposing and possibly reducing the biases we detect, in support of a more inclusive growth of sharing economy platforms.

<title>EFFECTIVENESS OF OPINION INFLUENCE APPROACHES IN HIGHLY CLUSTERED ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219525914500088</url>
<snippet>A mathematical model was developed for opinion propagation on online social networks using a scale-free network with an adjustable clustering coefficient. Connected nodes influence each other when the difference between their opinion values is less than a threshold value. The model is used to examine effectiveness of three different approaches for influencing public opinion. The approaches examined include (1) a "Class", defined as an approach (such as a class or book) that greatly influences a small, randomly selected portion of the population, (2) an "Advertisement", defined as an approach (such as a TV or online advertisement) that has a small influence at each viewing on a large randomly selected portion of the population, and (3) an "App", defined as an approach (such as a Facebook game or smartphone "App") that spreads via the online social network (rather than randomly) and has a small influence at each viewing on the affected population. The Class and Advertisement approaches result in similar overall influence on the population, despite the fact that these approaches are highly different. In contrast, the App approach has a much more significant effect on opinion values of users occupying clusters within the social network compared to the overall population.

<title>Information Network Among Farmers: A Case Study in Ghana</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440241228696</url>
<snippet>It is well established that a person's productivity is strongly related to interactions among their network cycles. Despite this, much of the literature concerning farmers' productivity describes only their formal relationships with extension officials, ignoring their personal relationships. This study was motivated by the need to understand how farmers can use their social networks to promote information diffusion and learning among themselves. The study assessed whether farmers' information networks can positively influence their productivity and performance through the study of their network structure. We used survey data from 200 Ghanaian farmers. The data was then analyzed using descriptive statistics and an exponential random graph model (ERGM). The results of this study showed that farmers' information networks had a positive effect on their performance and productivity. The study also revealed that farmers seek information from key and influential farmers while key farmers also seek information from other key farmers. A further finding of the study showed that many factors contributed to the successful diffusion of information, such as popularity, activity spread, reciprocity, multiple connections, and homophily of experience. However, on the other hand, transitivity was not significant in this network. Hence, this study clarifies the effect of the structural characteristics of farmers' information network which influence information diffusion for higher performance and productivity. This study argues that agricultural managers should take measures to ensure that farmers understand how their information network can benefit their peers, as well as their own performance and productivity. Studies have shown that, personal interaction and networks has the ability to influence a person's productivity. But most of the existing literature concentrate much on the formal relationships with extension officials, ignoring personal relationships.

<title>Textual Primacy Online: Impression Formation Based on Textual and Visual Cues in Facebook Profiles</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764217717563</url>
<snippet>The existing literature presents ambivalent evidence regarding the significance of visual cues, as opposed to textual cues, in the process of impression formation. While visual information may have a strong effect due to its vividness and immediate absorption, textual information might be more powerful due to its solid, unambiguous nature. This debate is particularly relevant in the context of online social networks, whose users share textual and visual elements. To explore our main research question, Which elements of one's Facebook profile have a more significant influence on impression formation of extroversionpictures or texts? we conducted two complementary online experiments, manipulating visual and textual cues inside and outside the context of Facebook. We then attempted to identify the relevant underlying mechanisms in impression formation. Our findings indicate that textual cues play a more dominant role online, whether via Facebook or not, supporting assertions of a new-media literacy that is text based. Additionally, we found the participants' level of need for cognition influenced the effect such that individuals with a high need for cognition placed more emphasis on textual cues. The number of likes was also a significant predictor of perceptions of the individuals' social orientation, especially when the other cues were ambiguous.

<title>How Social Networks Influence Human Behavior: An Integrated Latent Space Approach for Differential Social Influence</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11336-023-09934-5</url>
<snippet>How social networks influence human behavior has been an interesting topic in applied research. Existing methods often utilized scale-level behavioral data (e.g., total number of positive responses) to estimate the influence of a social network on human behavior. This study proposes a novel approach to studying social influence that utilizes item-level behavioral measures. Under the latent space modeling framework, we integrate the two latent spaces for respondents' social network data and item-level behavior measures into a single space we call 'interaction map'. The interaction map visualizes the association between the latent homophily among respondents and their item-level behaviors, revealing differential social influence effects across item-level behaviors. We also measure overall social influence by assessing the impact of the interaction map. We evaluate the properties of the proposed approach via extensive simulation studies and demonstrate the proposed approach with a real data in the context of studying how students' friendship network influences their participation in school activities.

<title>Categories and networks in jazz evolution: The overlap between bandleaders' jazz sidemen from 1930 to 1969</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2015.04.001</url>
<snippet>This paper expands on Peterson's process model for historical changes in jazz. Peterson suggests that, given certain circumstances, musical genres migrate from 'low-brow' to 'high-brow'. I test this proposition for jazz by investigating whether bandleaders were associated through the same sidemen ('sidemen overlap') across time, and the underlying logics leading to these overlaps. I confirm Peterson's model to the extent that sidemen overlap shifts from a 'commercial' logic to a 'style-based' logic. From 1930 to 1949, sidemen overlap between bandleaders is mainly predicted by recording session volumes (akin to 'commercial logic'). From 1945 to 1969, style similarity emerges as an important predictor of sidemen overlap. I extend Peterson's process model by providing a more nuanced account, based on social networks. I show substantive collaboration across styles. As a consequence, stylistic shifts are not as abrupt as originally depicted. I also explore how past associations become increasingly stronger in terms of explaining sidemen overlap. Furthermore, race emerges as an important variable in explaining the same phenomenon. During the thirties, non-African-American homophily is high. After this period, African-American homophily increases steadily until the late fifties, decreasing again during the sixties.

<title>Too many options: How to identify coalitions in a policy network?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2024.06.005</url>
<snippet>For different currents in policy analysis as policy networks and the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), identifying coalitions from policy beliefs and coordination between actors is crucial to a precise understanding of a policy process. Focusing particularly the relational dimension of ACF approaches linked with policy network analysis, determining policy subsystems from the actor collaborations and exchanges has recently begun offering fertile links with the network analysis. Studies in this way frequently apply Block Modeling and Community Detection (BMCD) strategies to define homogeneous political groups. However, the BMCD literature is growing quickly, using a wide variety of algorithms and interesting selection methods that are much more diverse than those used in the policy network analysis and particularly the ACF when this current focused on the collaboration networks before or after regarding the belief distance between actors. Identifying the best methodological option in a specific context can therefore be difficult and few ACF studies give an explicit justification. On the other hand, few BMCD publications offer a systematic comparison of real social networks and they are never applied to policy network datasets. This paper offers a new, relevant 5-Step selection method to reconcile advances in both the policy networks/ACF and BMCD. Using an application based on original African policy network data collected in Madagascar and Niger, we provide a useful set of practical recommendations for future ACF studies using policy network analysis: (i) the density and size of the policy network affect the identification process, (ii) the "best algorithm"can be rigorously determined by maximizing a novel indicator based on convergence and homogeneity between algorithm results, (iii) researchers need to be careful with missing data: they affect the results and imputation does not solve the problem.

<title>Universal association between depressive symptoms and social-network structures in the workplace</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14366-9</url>
<snippet>An unhealthy communication structure at a workplace can adversely affect the mental health of employees. However, little is known about the relationship between communication structures in the workplace and the mental health of employees. Here, we evaluated the face-to-face interaction network among employees (N = 449) in a variety of real-world working environments by using wearable devices and investigated the relationship between social network characteristics and depressive symptoms. We found that the cohesive interaction structure surrounding each individual was negatively correlated with depressive symptoms: a universal relationship regardless of occupation type. This correlation was evident at the group scale and was strongly related to active interactions with abundant body movement. Our findings provide a quantitative and collective perspective on taking a systematic approach to workplace depression, and they suggest that the mental health of employees needs to be addressed systematically, not only individually.

<snippet>We advance bi-national link-tracing sampling design, an innovative data collection methodology for sampling from so-called "transnational social fields", i.e. transnational networks embedding migrants, returned migrants and non-migrants. This paper describes our contributions to this methodology and its empirical implementation, and evaluates the features of the resulting networks (sample), with the aim to guide future research. We performed 303 face-to-face structured interviews on sociodemographic variables, migration trajectories and personal networks of people living in a Romanian migration sending community (Dambovi?a) and in a migration receiving Spanish town (Castellon). Inter-connecting the personal networks, we built a multi-layered complex network structure embedding 4,855 nominated people, 5,477 directed ties (nominations) and 2,540 edges. Results indicate that the link-tracing nomination patterns are affected by sex and residence homophily. Our research contributes to the emerging efforts of applying social network analysis to the study of international migration.

<title>A natural experiment of social network formation and dynamics</title>

<snippet>Social networks affect many aspects of life, including the spread of diseases, the diffusion of information, the workers' productivity, and consumers' behavior. Little is known, however, about how these networks form and change. Estimating causal effects and mechanisms that drive social network formation and dynamics is challenging because of the complexity of engineering social relations in a controlled environment, endogeneity between network structure and individual characteristics, and the lack of time-resolved data about individuals' behavior. We leverage data from a sample of 1.5 million college students on Facebook, who wrote more than 630 million messages and 590 million posts over 4 years, to design a long-term natural experiment of friendship formation and social dynamics in the aftermath of a natural disaster. The analysis shows that affected individuals are more likely to strengthen interactions, while maintaining the same number of friends as unaffected individuals. Our findings suggest that the formation of social relationships may serve as a coping mechanism to deal with high-stress situations and build resilience in communities.

<title>Origins of Homophily in an Evolving Social Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/599247</url>
<snippet>The authors investigate the origins of homophily in a large university community, using network data in which interactions, attributes, and affiliations are all recorded over time. The analysis indicates that highly similar pairs do show greater than average propensity to form new ties; however, it also finds that tie formation is heavily biased by triadic closure and focal closure, which effectively constrain the opportunities among which individuals may select. In the case of triadic closure, moreover, selection to "friend of a friend" status is determined by an analogous combination of individual preference and structural proximity. The authors conclude that the dynamic interplay of choice homophily and induced homophily, compounded over many "generations" of biased selection of similar individuals to structurally proximate positions, can amplify even a modest preference for similar others, via a cumulative advantage like process, to produce striking patterns of observed homophily.

<title>Social Content Recommendation Based on Spatial-Temporal Aware Diffusion Modeling in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym8090089</url>
<snippet>User interactions in online social networks (OSNs) enable the spread of information and enhance the information dissemination process, but at the same time they exacerbate the information overload problem. In this paper, we propose a social content recommendation method based on spatial-temporal aware controlled information diffusion modeling in OSNs. Users interact more frequently when they are close to each other geographically, have similar behaviors, and fall into similar demographic categories. Considering these facts, we propose multicriteria-based social ties relationship and temporal-aware probabilistic information diffusion modeling for controlled information spread maximization in OSNs. The proposed social ties relationship modeling takes into account user spatial information, content trust, opinion similarity, and demographics. We suggest a ranking algorithm that considers the user ties strength with friends and friends-of-friends to rank users in OSNs and select highly influential injection nodes. These nodes are able to improve social content recommendations, minimize information diffusion time, and maximize information spread. Furthermore, the proposed temporal-aware probabilistic diffusion process categorizes the nodes and diffuses the recommended content to only those users who are highly influential and can enhance information dissemination. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

<title>Exploring the Complex Pattern of Information Spreading in Online Blog Communities</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126894</url>
<snippet>Information spreading in online social communities has attracted tremendous attention due to its utmost practical values in applications. Despite that several individual-level diffusion data have been investigated, we still lack the detailed understanding of the spreading pattern of information. Here, by comparing information flows and social links in a blog community, we find that the diffusion processes are induced by three different spreading mechanisms: social spreading, self-promotion and broadcast. Although numerous previous studies have employed epidemic spreading models to simulate information diffusion, we observe that such models fail to reproduce the realistic diffusion pattern. In respect to users behaviors, strikingly, we find that most users would stick to one specific diffusion mechanism. Moreover, our observations indicate that the social spreading is not only crucial for the structure of diffusion trees, but also capable of inducing more subsequent individuals to acquire the information. Our findings suggest new directions for modeling of information diffusion in social systems, and could inform design of efficient propagation strategies based on users behaviors.

<title>Incorporating structural stigma into network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2020.05.005</url>
<snippet>A rich literature has explored the modeling of homophily and other forms of nonuniform mixing associated with individual-level covariates within the exponential family random graph (ERGM) framework. Such differential mixing does not fully explain phenomena such as stigma, however, which involve the active maintenance of social boundaries by ostracism of persons with out-group ties. Here, we introduce a new family of statistics that allows for such effects to be captured, making it possible to probe for the potential presence of boundary maintenance above and beyond simple differences in nomination rates. We demonstrate these statistics in the context of gender segregation in a school classroom, and introduce a framework for understanding the associated coefficients via network perturbation.

<title>Modelling and analysis of big data platform group adoption behaviour based on social network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101570</url>
<snippet>Due to the importance of big data technology in decision-making, production and service provision, enterprises have adopted various big data technologies and platforms to improve their operational efficiency. However, the number of enterprises that have adopted big data is not promising. The purpose of this study is to explore the current status of big data adoption by Chinese enterprises and to reveal the possible factors that hinder big data adoption from the group behaviour network perspective. Based on a real case survey of 54 big data platforms (BDPs), four types of networks-i.e., the enterprise-platform network, enterprise network, platform network and industry similarity and difference (ISD) network-are constructed and analysed on the basis of social network analysis (SNA). This study finds that among Chinese enterprises, the level and scope of big data adoption are generally low and are imbalanced among industries; the cognitive level and adoption behaviour of enterprises on BDPs are inconsistent, the compatibility of BDPs is different, and the density and distance-based cohesion of networks are weak; although the current big data adoption behaviours of Chinese enterprises have formed some structural features, core-periphery structures and maximal complete cliques are found, and the current network structure has little impact on individual enterprises and platforms; enterprises in the same industry prefer to adopt the same kind of big data technology or platform. Based on these findings, several strategies and suggestions to improve big data adoption are provided.

<title>Brokerage activity, exclusivity and role diversity: A three-dimensional approach to brokerage in networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.02.014</url>
<snippet>The purpose of this paper is to connect central theoretical contributions to the study of brokerage and propose a novel conceptual and analytical approach for investigating it. On one hand, it builds on, and further substantiate the utility of, the innovation of conceptualizing brokerage activity and brokerage exclusivity separately, whilst analyzing them together. On the other hand, it also builds on the seminal notion of qualitatively different brokerage roles and introduces the conceptual innovation of brokerage role diversity to study the implications of and for actors occupying one or several roles to similar or varying degrees. These implications are further unpacked by analyzing the specific brokerage activity and exclusivity for each brokerage role separately, before reassembling the results into a rich description of the patterns of brokerage among different types of actors. This three-dimensional approach was applied to study brokerage in a network of individual actors governing flood risk mitigation in a catchment area in Southern Sweden. The results suggest that studying these three dimensions of brokerage simultaneously provides a sharper lens that picks up important nuances that available approaches may fail to reveal. The paper makes a substantive contribution to the knowledge of brokerage in collaborative governance of complex issues, as well as a methodological contribution to the study of brokerage in general.

<title>The Spread of Behavior in an Online Social Network Experiment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1185231</url>
<snippet>How do social networks affect the spread of behavior? A popular hypothesis states that networks with many clustered ties and a high degree of separation will be less effective for behavioral diffusion than networks in which locally redundant ties are rewired to provide shortcuts across the social space. A competing hypothesis argues that when behaviors require social reinforcement, a network with more clustering may be more advantageous, even if the network as a whole has a larger diameter. I investigated the effects of network structure on diffusion by studying the spread of health behavior through artificially structured online communities. Individual adoption was much more likely when participants received social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the social network. The behavior spread farther and faster across clustered-lattice networks than across corresponding random networks.

<title>The revenue model of mainstream online social networks and potential alternatives: A scenario-based evaluation by German adolescents and adults</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102569</url>
<snippet>Mainstream Online Social Networks (OSNs) face extensive criticism for their revenue model and its negative consequences for users and societies. While experts often discuss alternative OSN models, little is known about potential users' evaluations of different OSN models. To close this research gap, the present study investigates how non-expert individuals, i.e., potential users, evaluate mainstream OSNs and expert-proposed alternative models. Next to the general evaluations of different models, individual differences among users open to various OSN models were explored. Three OSN scenarios were created based on interviews with experts from academia and industry and presented to samples of German adolescents (N = 1166) and adults (N = 878): one describing the "status quo", one "option" model similar to the model currently considered by Meta, and one describing a "public-service" broadcasting OSN. Participants rated each characteristic of the "status quo" scenario, indicated their willingness to pay for each of the three OSN models, and specified their preferred OSN model next to providing sociodemographic information. Replicated across both samples was that the "status quo" scenario received predominantly negative evaluations. Further replicated across both samples was that most participants were willing to pay for a "public-service" OSN and chose this model as the preferred one. Only a few significant relations of sociodemographic variables were observed. Consistently replicated across both samples, men rated various characteristics of the "status quo" scenario more positively, and women were more likely to prefer the "public-service" OSN. Some differences between the two samples also emerged. In summary, both adolescents and adults demonstrated receptivity to alternative OSN models, especially a public-service broadcasting OSN. Most sociodemographic factors had limited influence indicating potential widespread adoption if such an alternative was implemented - at least in Germany. Consequences arising from such a model for platform design, policy, regulation, and governance are discussed.

<title>Searching for superspreaders of information in real-world social media</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep05547</url>
<snippet>A number of predictors have been suggested to detect the most influential spreaders of information in online social media across various domains such as Twitter or Facebook. In particular, degree, PageRank, k-core and other centralities have been adopted to rank the spreading capability of users in information dissemination media. So far, validation of the proposed predictors has been done by simulating the spreading dynamics rather than following real information flow in social networks. Consequently, only model-dependent contradictory results have been achieved so far for the best predictor. Here, we address this issue directly. We search for influential spreaders by following the real spreading dynamics in a wide range of networks. We find that the widely-used degree and PageRank fail in ranking users' influence. We find that the best spreaders are consistently located in the k-core across dissimilar social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Livejournal and scientific publishing in the American Physical Society. Furthermore, when the complete global network structure is unavailable, we find that the sum of the nearest neighbors' degree is a reliable local proxy for user's influence. Our analysis provides practical instructions for optimal design of strategies for "viral'' information dissemination in relevant applications.

<title>The structure of social exchange networks: A game-theoretic reformulation of Blau's model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/271023</url>
<snippet>This paper advances a theoretical method that uses social exchange theory to explain the structure of social networks. I begin to develop this generic method through a specific application. Reformulating Blau's (1964) model of social exchange to reflect the dynamic nature of interaction and the accompanying potential for opportunistic behavior, I demonstrate how social exchange may be formalized as a repeated game, and how game-theoretic models may be used to predict the stability of particular exchange network structures. The specific application offers some evidence of the fruitfulness of the generic theoretical method, providing an explanation for the strong, reciprocal relationships in the workgroup advice network observed by Blau (1955).

<title>Effectiveness of dismantling strategies on moderated vs. unmoderated online social platforms</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71231-3</url>
<snippet>Online social networks are the perfect test bed to better understand large-scale human behavior in interacting contexts. Although they are broadly used and studied, little is known about how their terms of service and posting rules affect the way users interact and information spreads. Acknowledging the relation between network connectivity and functionality, we compare the robustness of two different online social platforms, Twitter and Gab, with respect to banning, or dismantling, strategies based on the recursive censor of users characterized by social prominence (degree) or intensity of inflammatory content (sentiment). We find that the moderated (Twitter) vs. unmoderated (Gab) character of the network is not a discriminating factor for intervention effectiveness. We find, however, that more complex strategies based upon the combination of topological and content features may be effective for network dismantling. Our results provide useful indications to design better strategies for countervailing the production and dissemination of anti-social content in online social platforms.

<title>Approximating individual interactions in compartmental system dynamics models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sdr.1599</url>
<snippet>This paper introduces an approach known as a pair approximation developed in physics and mathematical biology that captures some of the effects of network structure in a compartmental system dynamics (CSD) model without substantially increasing model complexity or computational efficiency. We describe the approach using a familiar example: the standard SIS model from epidemiology that underpins many models from the marketing and innovation diffusion literature. We show that the pair approximation better approximates the results of an agent-based simulation than the standard CSD. The model provides insights regarding the epidemic threshold, with implications for halting the spread of a disease or encouraging the spread of a product, that cannot be obtained from the standard CSD. We further illustrate the technique through the development of two new CSD models: a model of social contagion, SIS2, that allows for social recovery, and a model of technology adoption with local network effects.

<title>Peers and Sources as Social Capital in the Production of News: Online Social Networks as Communities of Journalists</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439314539128</url>
<snippet>In a very short time span, Twitter has become a major force in modern societies and also in the production of news by journalists. How journalists use Twitter is studied extensively, particularly on a small scale (i.e., qualitative research, specific events, mostly descriptive). However, studies on how Twitter has impacted journalism as a whole are relatively scarce. This study focuses on the adoption of Twitter and its emerging community network structure in the Netherlands. Using the social network data of 2,152 journalists as retrieved from Twitter, analysis shows that the social network among journalists is well connected. The journalists who are extremely popular are also able to influence the flow of information through the network more than others (cf. gatekeeper role). Still, even though gatekeeping positions in the network are present due to the absence of specific relations, and the network consists of eight tightly knit network communities, the entire network is very well connected. The adoption of Twitter as a microblogging and networking service over time indicated that adoption increased particularly in early 2009. The possible consequences of these tightly knit communities for the production of news are discussed in terms of pack journalism, echo chambers, and information cascades.

<title>Gender homophily and gender distribution in social networks: The case of older adults in long term care settings</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.06.005</url>
<snippet>Distinctiveness theory suggests that numeric rarity is correlated with stronger homophily. In this paper, we examine this theory by studying gender homophily in social networks of older adults. We document subjective social networks in multiple long term care settings for older adults over several time points. Homophily for each gender is estimated using exponential random graph models. We find evidence for positive homophily across all networks, and show that it is correlated to the magnitude of the female majority or male minority. Our findings empirically verify distinctiveness theory and could improve interventions to promote tie formation in social networks.

<title>The role of online social networks for divorced Saudi women in the face of social, psychological, economic, and legal challenges</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2017.07.008</url>
<snippet>This research examines the supporting role social networks provide to divorced Saudi women in the face of social, economic, psychological, and legal challenges. An online survey with open and closed ended questions was created to address the following research question: What support do online social networks provide to divorced Saudi women in contemporary Saudi Arabian society in the face of social, economic, psychological, and legal challenges?" The survey was completed online by 248 divorced Saudi women. Quantitative analysis of closed-ended survey responses was applied to the dataset followed by a qualitative thematic analysis of respondents' responses to open-ended questions. Survey findings identified the following areas of medium to high social network support experienced by divorced Saudi women: social outcast avoidance, relationship management with former husband, income assistance, emotional support, confidence building, and depression management. Findings also revealed areas where social networks provided only low levels of support with respect to social, economic, psychological, and legal challenges. The research contributes new insights into the supporting role of social networks for divorced Saudi women and their potential to leverage personal life and identity development in the face of social stigmatization and societal marginalization. This work advances research relevant to media studies, woman's studies, and cultural studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

<title>Mass media impact on opinion evolution in biased digital environments: a bounded confidence model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-39725-y</url>
<snippet>People increasingly shape their opinions by accessing and discussing content shared on social networking websites. These platforms contain a mixture of other users' shared opinions and content from mainstream media sources. While online social networks have fostered information access and diffusion, they also represent optimal environments for the proliferation of polluted information and contents, which are argued to be among the co-causes of polarization/radicalization phenomena. Moreover, recommendation algorithms - intended to enhance platform usage - likely augment such phenomena, generating the so-called Algorithmic Bias. In this work, we study the effects of the combination of social influence and mass media influence on the dynamics of opinion evolution in a biased online environment, using a recent bounded confidence opinion dynamics model with algorithmic bias as a baseline and adding the possibility to interact with one or more media outlets, modeled as stubborn agents. We analyzed four different media landscapes and found that an open-minded population is more easily manipulated by external propaganda - moderate or extremist - while remaining undecided in a more balanced information environment. By reinforcing users' biases, recommender systems appear to help avoid the complete manipulation of the population by external propaganda.

<title>Bridging: Locating critical connectors in a network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2010.03.003</url>
<snippet>This paper proposes several measures for bridging in networks derived from Granovetter's (1973) insight that links which reduce distances in a network are important structural bridges. Bridging is calculated by systematically deleting links and calculating the resultant changes in network cohesion (measured as the inverse average path length). The average change for each node's links provides an individual level measure of bridging. We also present a normalized version which controls for network size and a network-level bridging index. Bridging properties are demonstrated on hypothetical networks, empirical networks, and a set of 100 randomly generated networks to show how the bridging measure correlates with existing network measures such as degree, personal network density, constraint, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and vitality. Bridging and the accompanying methodology provide a family of new network measures useful for studying network structure, network dynamics, and network effects on substantive behavioral phenomenon.

<title>A scoping review on the current and potential use of social network analysis for evaluation purposes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1356389018782219</url>
<snippet>The pervasiveness and importance of relationships and networks has fueled the development of the social network analysis approach, which considers structural relationships to be primary causes of societal outcomes. While the potential of social network analysis has been demonstrated and discussed extensively in social science research, relatively little is known about the current and potential use of social network analysis for evaluation purposes. This scoping review of journal articles reveals that evaluators use social network analysis because of its ability to identify key stakeholders, assess network structures and relationships quantitatively, reveal informal relations and visualize even complex networks. However, challenges arise when interpreting findings, determining causation between network structures and outcomes and disseminating evaluation results in an ethically responsible manner. The review concludes that the evaluation field?especially in the development sector?would benefit greatly from increased use of social network analysis, but that this would first require improved use of alternative sources of network data, qualitative methods and inferential statistics that will enable evaluators to move beyond descriptive network analysis.

<snippet>Two key problems in the study of longitudinal networks are determining when to chunk continuous time data into discrete time periods for network analysis and identifying periodicity in the data. In addition, statistical process control applied to longitudinal social network measures can be biased by the effects of relational dependence and periodicity in the data. Thus, the detection of change is often obscured by random noise. Fourier analysis is used to determine statistically significant periodic frequencies in longitudinal network data. Two approaches are then offered: using significant periods as a basis to chunk data for longitudinal network analysis or using the significant periods to filter the longitudinal data.

<title>Keeping to the code: How local norms of friendship and dating inform macro-structures of adolescents' romantic networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.11.012</url>
<snippet>Even though romantic partnerships are often understood as pairwise relationships, there is value in conceptualizing the dating patterns of adolescents as network phenomena, particularly as related to the spread of sexually transmitted infections. The current study adopts this perspective to evaluate how a local norm guiding the coexistence of dating and friendship informs macro-level romantic network structures. Using twelve months of romantic relationship data from the Peers and the Emergence of Adolescent Romance (PEAR) study, we find that the global dating network resembles a chain-like, spanning tree structure consistent with that observed by Bearman and colleagues (2004)in their foundational study. Then, through the application of temporal ERGMs, we uncover evidence that adolescents adhere to a social norm against dating their friends' previous romantic partners. We use these findings to empirically ground a series of network simulations, which demonstrate that the romantic network's structure becomes less redundant and more clustered as the norm against dating friends' previous partners is relaxed. By understanding how local norms shape patterns of friendship and dating, we can better conceptualize the macro-level structural patterns of romantic networks and their implications for infectious disease diffusion.

<title>Networks of action and events over time. A multilevel discrete-time event history model for longitudinal network data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2010.09.003</url>
<snippet>Longitudinal network data recording the moment at which ties appear, change, or disappear are increasingly available. Event history models can be used to analyze the dynamics of time-stamped network data. This paper adapts the discrete-time event history model to social network data. A discrete-time event history model can easily incorporate a multilevel design and time-varying covariates. A multilevel design is needed to account for dependencies among ties and vertices, which should not be ignored in a small longitudinal network. Time-varying covariates are required to analyze network effects, that is, the impact of previous ties. In addition, a discrete-time event history model handles constraints on who can act or who can be acted upon in a straightforward way. The model can be estimated with multilevel logistic regression analysis, which is illustrated by an application to book reviews, so network evolution can be analyzed with a fairly standard statistical tool.

<title>Global network structure of dominance hierarchy of ant workers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2014.0599</url>
<snippet>Dominance hierarchy among animals is widespread in various species and believed to serve to regulate resource allocation within an animal group. Unlike small groups, however, detection and quantification of linear hierarchy in large groups of animals are a difficult task. Here, we analyse aggression-based dominance hierarchies formed by worker ants in Diacamma sp. as large directed networks. We show that the observed dominance networks are perfect or approximate directed acyclic graphs, which are consistent with perfect linear hierarchy. The observed networks are also sparse and random but significantly different from networks generated through thinning of the perfect linear tournament (i.e. all individuals are linearly ranked and dominance relationship exists between every pair of individuals). These results pertain to global structure of the networks, which contrasts with the previous studies inspecting frequencies of different types of triads. In addition, the distribution of the out-degree (i.e. number of workers that the focal worker attacks), not in-degree (i.e. number of workers that attack the focal worker), of each observed network is right-skewed. Those having excessively large out-degrees are located near the top, but not the top, of the hierarchy. We also discuss evolutionary implications of the discovered properties of dominance networks.

<snippet>The present study investigated the way men visually self-present on MSM-specific mobile dating app profiles, as well as the connection between visual self-presentation strategies, demographic variables, and psychosocial attitudes about masculinity and the body. In particular, emphasis was placed on two aspects of men's visual self-presentation: face-disclosure and body-disclosure. Using a selective self-presentation framework, findings indicated that the majority of men presented their face in their profile photo and that nearly one in five presented their unclothed torso. Face-disclosure was connected to higher levels of app usage, longer-term app usage, and levels of outness. The use of shirtless photos was related to age, a higher drive for muscularity, more self-perceived masculinity, and stronger anti-effeminacy attitudes. The findings are discussed in relation to both strategic self-presentation, and the distinct meanings of face and body photos within MSM online culture.

<title>Partnership Ties Shape Friendship Networks: A Dynamic Social Network Study</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/sov079</url>
<snippet>Partnership ties shape friendship networks through different social forces. First, partnership ties drive clustering in friendship networks: individuals who are in a partnership tend to have common friends and befriend other couples. Second, partnership ties influence the level of homophily in these emerging friendship clusters. Partners tend to be similar in a number of attributes (homogamy). If one partner selects friends based on preferences for homophily, then the other partner may befriend the same person regardless of whether they also have homophilic preferences. Thus, two homophilic ties emerge based on a single partner's preferences. This amplification of homophily can be observed in many attributes (e.g., ethnicity, religion, age). Gender homophily, however, may be de-amplified, as the gender of partners differs in heterosexual partnerships. In our study, we follow dynamic friendship formation among 126 individuals and their cohabiting partners in a university-related graduate housing community over a period of nine months (N = 2,250 self-reported friendship relations). We find that partnership ties strongly shape the dynamic process of friendship formation. They are a main driver of local network clustering and explain a striking amount of homophily.

<title>Cognitive cascades: How to model (and potentially counter) the spread of fake news</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261811</url>
<snippet>Understanding the spread of false or dangerous beliefs-often called misinformation or disinformation-through a population has never seemed so urgent. Network science researchers have often taken a page from epidemiologists, and modeled the spread of false beliefs as similar to how a disease spreads through a social network. However, absent from those disease-inspired models is an internal model of an individual's set of current beliefs, where cognitive science has increasingly documented how the interaction between mental models and incoming messages seems to be crucially important for their adoption or rejection. Some computational social science modelers analyze agent-based models where individuals do have simulated cognition, but they often lack the strengths of network science, namely in empirically-driven network structures. We introduce a cognitive cascade model that combines a network science belief cascade approach with an internal cognitive model of the individual agents as in opinion diffusion models as a public opinion diffusion (POD) model, adding media institutions as agents which begin opinion cascades. We show that the model, even with a very simplistic belief function to capture cognitive effects cited in disinformation study (dissonance and exposure), adds expressive power over existing cascade models. We conduct an analysis of the cognitive cascade model with our simple cognitive function across various graph topologies and institutional messaging patterns. We argue from our results that population-level aggregate outcomes of the model qualitatively match what has been reported in COVID-related public opinion polls, and that the model dynamics lend insights as to how to address the spread of problematic beliefs. The overall model sets up a framework with which social science misinformation researchers and computational opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to understand, and hopefully learn how to best counter, the spread of disinformation and "alternative facts."

<title>Detecting and modelling real percolation and phase transitions of information on social media</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01090-z</url>
<snippet>Xie et al. directly observe the percolation phase transition of information on large-scale online social media and find that the positive-feedback coevolution between users' activity level and network structure greatly increases the spreading power. It is widely believed that information spread on social media is a percolation process, with parallels to phase transitions in theoretical physics. However, evidence for this hypothesis is limited, as phase transitions have not been directly observed in any social media. Here, through an analysis of 100 million Weibo and 40 million Twitter users, we identify percolation-like spread and find that it happens more readily than current theoretical models would predict. The lower percolation threshold can be explained by the existence of positive feedback in the coevolution between network structure and user activity level, such that more-active users gain more followers. Moreover, this coevolution induces an extreme imbalance in users' influence. Our findings indicate that the ability of information to spread across social networks is higher than expected, with implications for many information-spread problems.

<title>Multidisciplinary learning through collective performance favors decentralization</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2303568120</url>
<snippet>Many models of learning in teams assume that team members can share solutions or learn concurrently. However, these assumptions break down in multidisciplinary teams where team members often complete distinct, interrelated pieces of larger tasks. Such contexts make it difficult for individuals to separate the performance effects of their own actions from the actions of interacting neighbors. In this work, we show that individuals can overcome this challenge by learning from network neighbors through mediating artifacts (like collective performance assessments). When neighbors' actions influence collective outcomes, teams with different networks perform relatively similarly to one another. However, varying a team's network can affect performance on tasks that weight individuals' contributions by network properties. Consequently, when individuals innovate (through "exploring" searches), dense networks hurt performance slightly by increasing uncertainty. In contrast, dense networks moderately help performance when individuals refine their work (through "exploiting" searches) by efficiently finding local optima. We also find that decentralization improves team performance across a battery of 34 tasks. Our results offer design principles for multidisciplinary teams within which other forms of learning prove more difficult.

<title>Sensitivity Analysis of an Individual-Based Model for Simulation of Influenza Epidemics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0045414</url>
<snippet>Individual-based epidemiology models are increasingly used in the study of influenza epidemics. Several studies on influenza dynamics and evaluation of intervention measures have used the same incubation and infectious period distribution parameters based on the natural history of influenza. A sensitivity analysis evaluating the influence of slight changes to these parameters (in addition to the transmissibility) would be useful for future studies and real-time modeling during an influenza pandemic. In this study, we examined individual and joint effects of parameters and ranked parameters based on their influence on the dynamics of simulated epidemics. We also compared the sensitivity of the model across synthetic social networks for Montgomery County in Virginia and New York City (and surrounding metropolitan regions) with demographic and rural-urban differences. In addition, we studied the effects of changing the mean infectious period on age-specific epidemics. The research was performed from a public health standpoint using three relevant measures: time to peak, peak infected proportion and total attack rate. We also used statistical methods in the design and analysis of the experiments. The results showed that: (i) minute changes in the transmissibility and mean infectious period significantly influenced the attack rate; (ii) the mean of the incubation period distribution appeared to be sufficient for determining its effects on the dynamics of epidemics; (iii) the infectious period distribution had the strongest influence on the structure of the epidemic curves; (iv) the sensitivity of the individual-based model was consistent across social networks investigated in this study and (v) age-specific epidemics were sensitive to changes in the mean infectious period irrespective of the susceptibility of the other age groups. These findings suggest that small changes in some of the disease model parameters can significantly influence the uncertainty observed in real-time forecasting and predicting of the characteristics of an epidemic.

<title>Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer: structural properties of negative relationships on Twitter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-024-00485-y</url>
<snippet>The Ego Network Model (ENM) is a model for the structural organisation of relationships, rooted in evolutionary anthropology, that is found ubiquitously in social contexts. It takes the perspective of a single user (Ego) and organises their contacts (Alters) into a series of (typically 5) concentric circles of decreasing intimacy and increasing size. Alters are sorted based on their tie strength to the Ego, however, this is difficult to measure directly. Traditionally, the interaction frequency has been used as a proxy but this misses the qualitative aspects of connections, such as signs (i.e. polarity), which have been shown to provide extremely useful information. However, the sign of an online social relationship is usually an implicit piece of information, which needs to be estimated by interaction data from Online Social Networks (OSNs), making sign prediction in OSNs a research challenge in and of itself. This work aims to bring the ENM into the signed networks domain by investigating the interplay of signed connections with the ENM. This paper delivers 2 main contributions. Firstly, a new and data-efficient method of signing relationships between individuals using sentiment analysis and, secondly, we provide an in-depth look at the properties of Signed Ego Networks (SENs), using 9 Twitter datasets of various categories of users. We find that negative connections are generally over-represented in the active part of the Ego Networks, suggesting that Twitter greatly over-emphasises negative relationships with respect to "offline" social networks. Further, users who use social networks for professional reasons have an even greater share of negative connections. Despite this, we also found weak signs that less negative users tend to allocate more cognitive effort to individual relationships and thus have smaller ego networks on average. All in all, even though structurally ENMs are known to be similar in both offline and online social networks, our results indicate that relationships on Twitter tend to nurture more negativity than offline contexts.

<title>MUTABLE SELVES AND DIGITAL REFLEXIVITIES: SOCIAL MEDIA FOR SOCIAL CHANGE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/S0163-239620140000043015</url>
<snippet>To examine how social media restrict and recreate messages within current interactionist scripts in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), this study applies a framework of digital reflexivity highlighting stages of information flow. It applies the symbolic interaction concept of emotional events to analyze the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi and the role of social media in disseminating Bouazizi's act as one catalyst of the MENA citizen uprisings. The role of social media in the "Arab Spring" merits investigation because social media provide opportunities to examine shifting identities, interactions, and actions of citizen activists in the MENA uprisings. This study is important and timely because little symbolic interactionist scholarship exists on MENA identities and social movements, or on crowd interaction and activism outside the West. The nuanced nature of MENA political activism and complex processes of the development of activists' "mutable" selves (Zurcher, 1977) are fluid and resistant to symbolically defined social roles, interactionist scripts and reflexivity, and public communication practices in a MENA under political and social transition.

<title>The role of network setting and gender in online content popularity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1252411</url>
<snippet>In this study, we explore the role of specific network structures that enhance social capital and assess the extent to which gender, social ties, and communication interaction relate to content popularity within online social networks (OSNs). Our results are based on an extensive OSN data set, containing over 100,000 members, connected by over 1.7 million links. The findings indicate that content popularity inference is more accurate when considering activity interaction among users and that network structures known as advantageous for amassing social capital in the offline environment are relevant online as well. We conclude by discussing how gender mediates the correlation between some network measures and the growth of users' content popularity and provide a potential explanation for the emergence of gender differences.

<title>Homophily Among Good Friends. Close and Weak Friendships Between Children With Migration Background and Native Peers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Modifying M. Granovetters distinction between strong and weak tie friendships, social assimilation of immigrant children will be investigated from a social network perspective. Using data from primary school classes we start from the assumption that particularly close friendships have a positive impact on the process of acculturation. We investigate the role of ethnic homophily in the formation of weak and close friendships between immigrant and native children. In doing so, alternative explanations of friendship formation like social homophily as a mediator of ethnic homophily will be considered measured by similarity of ego and alter in terms of cultural capital "in the objectified state". As a result, immigrant children of Turkish origin have friendships with native peers, but these connections tend to be rather weak tie relations. Dyads of two Turkish children, in contrast, chances of close friendships are higher. It will be argued that these results are in line with the concept of selective acculturation of immigrant children of Turkish origin.

<title>Studying information recurrence, gatekeeping, and the role of communities during internet outages in Venezuela</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87473-8</url>
<snippet>Many authoritarian regimes have taken to censoring internet access in order to stop the spread of misinformation, restrict citizens from discussing certain topics, and prevent mobilization, among other reasons. There are several theories about the effectiveness of censorship. Some suggest that censorship will effectively limit the flow of information, whereas others predict that a backlash will form, resulting in ultimately more discussion about the topic. In this work, we analyze the role of communities and gatekeepers during multiple internet outages in Venezuela in January 2019. First, we measure how critical information (e.g., entities and hashtags) spreads during outages focusing on information recurrence and burstiness within and across language and location communities. We discover that information bursts tend to cross both language and location community boundaries rather than being limited to a single community during several outages. Then we identify users who play central roles and propose a novel method to detect gatekeepers-users who prevent critical information from spreading across communities during outages. We show that bilingual and English-speaking users play more central roles compared to Spanish-speaking users, but users inside and outside Venezuela have similar distribution of centrality. Finally, we measure the differences in social network structure before and after each outage event and discuss its effect on how information spreads. We find that with each outage event social connections tend to get less connected with higher mean shortest path, indicating that the effect of censorship makes it harder for information to spread.

<title>Equicentrality and network centralization: A micro-macro linkage</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2007.07.004</url>
<snippet>This paper investigates a linkage between micro- and macrostructures as an intrinsic property of social networks. In particular, it examines the linkage between equicentrality [Kang, S.M., 2007. A note on measures of similarity based on centrality. Social Networks 29, 137-142] as a conceptualization of a microstructural process (i.e., the likelihood of social actors to be connected with similarly central others) and network centralization as a macrostructural construct, and shows that they have a negative linear association. In other words, when actors are connected with similarly central alters (i.e., high equicentrality), the overall network centralization is low. Conversely, when highly central actors are connected with low-centrality actors (i.e., low equicentrality), the overall network centralization is high. The relationship between degree equicentrality and degree centralization is more significant in observed networks, especially those evolving over time, as compared to random networks. An application of this property is given by venture capital co-investment networks. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>The ties that bind global governance: Using media-reported events to disentangle the global interorganizational network in a global pandemic</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.02.012</url>
<snippet>This article disentangles the global interorganizational network by analyzing the ties of international actors comprising multinational companies, intergovernmental organizations, and international nongovernmental organizations. The onset of COVID-19 is a rare opportunity to explore how this network has evolved in an exogenous event. Using a unique GDELT big dataset of events reported by the world's media, we extract and analyze the interorganizational interactions of international actors before and after the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the COVID-19 outbreak was a public health emergency of international concern. Adopting an exploratory and descriptive approach at multiple levels of analysis, we draw on the theory of networks to uncover the fragmented, polycentric, and complex characteristics of the global interorganizational network. Our study highlights the use of media-reported events and the Goldstein scale as means to unpack the difficult-to-capture relational dynamics of international actors, which can help in theory development of the global interorganizational network that is crucial for collective action to address societal grand challenges.

<title>Resource sharing in technologically defined social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08935-2</url>
<snippet>Technologically enabled sharing-economy networks are changing the way humans trade and collaborate. Here, using a novel 'Wi-Fi sharing' game, we explored determinants of human sharing strategy. Subjects (N = 1,950) participated in a networked game in which they could choose how to allocate a limited, but personally not usable, resource (representing unused Wi-Fi bandwidth) to immediate network neighbors. We first embedded N = 600 subjects into 30 networks, experimentally manipulating the range over which subjects could connect. We find that denser networks decrease any wealth inequality, but that this effect saturates. Individuals' benefit is shaped by their network position, with having many partners who in turn have few partners being especially beneficial. We propose a new, simplified "sharing centrality" metric for quantifying this. Further experiments (N = 1,200) confirm the robustness of the effect of network structure on sharing behavior. Our findings suggest the possibility of interventions to help more evenly distribute shared resources over networks.

<title>Network Structure Can Amplify Innovation Adoption and Polarization in Group-Structured Populations with Outgroup Aversion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.5167</url>
<snippet>Individuals' decisions to adopt an innovation can be influenced by the frequency of other adopters as well as by the group membership of previous adopters or non-adopters in their social network. In addition, adoption or non-adoption of some innovations has been characterized as a means of signaling identification with a group. While identity signaling and outgroup aversion effects on adoption and polarization have been considered in a geo-spatial environment, this work extends an existing model of outgroup aversion to a network-based environment. The results show that adoption levels in a network environment were higher, and polarization lower compared to the non-network environment with all other factors fixed. As more factors were varied, the associated change to adoption and polarization were amplified in network environments. The two most significant factors influencing adoption variability were the degree of outgroup aversion and the level of frequency dependence. Finally, in network environments with outgroup aversion, adoption was found to be higher when modularity and eigenvector centrality were high. In today's polarized social environment, understanding these effects is critical to the adoption of emerging innovations such as mitigating climate change, combating novel viruses, or decentralizing financial transactions. While innovators are often focused on solving technical challenges to advance adoption of an innovation, equal emphasis on understanding and solving social and potential outgroup effects will be needed to achieve a desired adoption level.

<title>Modeling the impact of supra-structural network nodes: The case of anonymous syringe sharing and HIV among people who inject drugs</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2011.12.004</url>
<snippet>Networks are well understood as crucial to the diffusion of HIV among injection drug users (IDUs), but quasi-anonymous risk nodes - such as shooting galleries - resist measurement and incorporation into empirical analyses of disease diffusion. Drawing on network data from 767 IDUs in Bushwick, Brooklyn, we illustrate the use of calibrated agent-based models (CABMs) to account for network structure, injection practices, and quasi-anonymous transmission in shooting galleries. Results confirm the importance of network structure and actor heterogeneity to the magnitude and speed of HIV transmission. Models further demonstrate that quasi-anonymous injections in shooting galleries increase the speed of HIV diffusion across the whole network and have the greatest impact on HIV seroconversion levels for IDUs at the network periphery. Shooting galleries are shown to be transmission hubs that operate independently of traceable structural ties, linking otherwise unconnected network components. CABMs potentially increase understandings of HIV diffusion dynamics by infusing computer simulations with empirical data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2024.08.007</url>
<snippet>The present empirical study aims to explore medical knowledge sharing in the Australian healthcare context, aiming to broadly evaluate the potential impact of Project ECHO (R), (R), an online mentoring and networking health program. We focus on health-related knowledge sharing practices among the network of professionals through formal and informal channels, and across different health and non-health sectors and organisational systems. Studying knowledge transmission among professional networks is essential for optimizing healthcare delivery, promoting innovation, and providing insights on improvement of patient experiences within the healthcare system. We utilize a multilevel approach to shape our data collection strategy. Employing network measures and Multilevel Exponential Random Graph Models, we aim to explore how advice and knowledge sharing behaviours among healthcare professionals and their institutions are interdependently connected. Then, we incorporate network generated results within an evaluation framework for establishing some aspects of the efficiency of the ECHO program along four pillars: Acceptability, , Capability, , Reachability, , and Integration. . Our investigation found that among ECHO members, hierarchy is less pronounced compared to across levels and organizations, with certain individuals emerging as central in advice-sharing. The multilevel network perspective showed complex, informal patterns of knowledge and information sharing, including inter-organizational hierarchy, role and sector homophily, brokerage roles with popularity across health organizations, and connectivity through knowledge-sharing in cross-level small group clusters.

<title>Time-Ordered Networks Reveal Limitations to Information Flow in Ant Colonies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020298</url>
<snippet>Background: An important function of many complex networks is to inhibit or promote the transmission of disease, resources, or information between individuals. However, little is known about how the temporal dynamics of individual-level interactions affect these networks and constrain their function. Ant colonies are a model comparative system for understanding general principles linking individual-level interactions to network-level functions because interactions among individuals enable integration of multiple sources of information to collectively make decisions, and allocate tasks and resources. Methodology/Findings: Here we show how the temporal and spatial dynamics of such individual interactions provide upper bounds to rates of colony-level information flow in the ant Temnothorax rugatulus. We develop a general framework for analyzing dynamic networks and a mathematical model that predicts how information flow scales with individual mobility and group size. Conclusions/Significance: Using thousands of time-stamped interactions between uniquely marked ants in four colonies of a range of sizes, we demonstrate that observed maximum rates of information flow are always slower than predicted, and are constrained by regulation of individual mobility and contact rate. By accounting for the ordering and timing of interactions, we can resolve important difficulties with network sampling frequency and duration, enabling a broader understanding of interaction network functioning across systems and scales.

<title>Assessing information-sharing networks within small-scale fisheries and the implications for conservation interventions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211240</url>
<snippet>The effectiveness of behavioural interventions in conservation often depends on local resource users' underlying social interactions. However, it remains unclear to what extent differences in related topics of information shared between resource users can alter network structure-holding implications for information flows and the spread of behaviours. Here, we explore the differences in nine subtopics of fishing information related to the planned expansion of a community co-management scheme aiming to reduce sea turtle bycatch at a small-scale fishery in Peru. We show that the general network structure detailing information sharing about sea turtle bycatch is dissimilar from other fishing information sharing. Specifically, no significant degree assortativity (degree homophily) was identified, and the variance in node eccentricity was lower than expected under our null models. We also demonstrate that patterns of information sharing between fishers related to sea turtle bycatch are more similar to information sharing about fishing regulations, and vessel technology and maintenance, than to information sharing about weather, fishing activity, finances and crew management. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing information-sharing networks in contexts directly relevant to the desired intervention and demonstrate the identification of social contexts that might be more or less appropriate for information sharing related to planned conservation actions.

<title>Estimating peer effects in networks with peer encouragement designs</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1511201113</url>
<snippet>Peer effects, in which the behavior of an individual is affected by the behavior of their peers, are central to social science. Because peer effects are often confounded with homophily and common external causes, recent work has used randomized experiments to estimate effects of specific peer behaviors. These experiments have often relied on the experimenter being able to randomly modulate mechanisms by which peer behavior is transmitted to a focal individual. We describe experimental designs that instead randomly assign individuals' peers to encouragements to behaviors that directly affect those individuals. We illustrate this method with a large peer encouragement design on Facebook for estimating the effects of receiving feedback from peers on posts shared by focal individuals. We find evidence for substantial effects of receiving marginal feedback on multiple behaviors, including giving feedback to others and continued posting. These findings provide experimental evidence for the role of behaviors directed at specific individuals in the adoption and continued use of communication technologies. In comparison, observational estimates differ substantially, both underestimating and overestimating effects, suggesting that researchers and policy makers should be cautious in relying on them.

<title>Structure matters: Assessing the statistical significance of network topologies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0309005</url>
<snippet>Network analysis has found widespread utility in many research areas. However, assessing the statistical significance of observed relationships within networks remains a complex challenge. Traditional node permutation tests are often insufficient in capturing the effect of changing network topology by creating reliable null distributions. We propose two randomization alternatives to address this gap: random rewiring and controlled rewiring. These methods incorporate changes in the network topology through edge swaps. However, controlled rewiring allows for more nuanced alterations of the original network than random rewiring. In this sense, this paper introduces a novel evaluation tool, the Expanded Quadratic Assignment Procedure (EQAP), designed to calculate a specific p-value and interpret statistical tests with enhanced precision. The combination of EQAP and controlled rewiring provides a robust network comparison and statistical analysis framework. The methodology is exemplified through two real-world examples: the analysis of an organizational network structure, illustrated by the Enron-Email dataset, and a social network case, represented by the UK Faculty friendship network. The utility of these statistical tests is underscored by their capacity to safeguard researchers against Type I errors when exploring network metrics dependent on intricate topologies.

<title>CENTRALITY AND THE STRUCTURE OF URBAN INTERACTION - MEASURES, CONCEPTS, AND APPLICATIONS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2579964</url>
<snippet>Although social network analysis has provided many measures of network position, these are rarely applied to spatial networks. Sociological measures of network structure were constructed to reflect binary interactions and such measures were of limited use in analysis of urban systems. Recently, several measures have been refined to accommodate the asymmetric continuous flows of people and information across space, making them appropriate for urban models. In this article, we evaluate the applicability of graph theoretic measures to the urban system. We find that graph theoretic conceptualizations of centrality are consistent with theoretical specifications of urban hierarchy. We then apply centrality measures to simulated and actual urban systems. We conclude that such measures elucidate key substantive issues relevant to increasingly complex sociospatial structures.

<title>Social Support and the Religious Dimensions of Close Ties</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12134</url>
<snippet>Despite the influence of social support on physical and mental health, few studies have examined why some close ties are more supportive than others. Though religion provides a rich context for social interaction and a meaningful social identity, it has received little attention in the social support literature. A growing literature on religion and health offers insight into how religion affects social support processes. Using dyadic network data derived from the nationally representative 2006 Portraits of American Life Study, I examine how the religious dimensions of close, nonhousehold ties relate to provision of social support. Results from logistic regression analyses indicate that (controlling for a range of other social tie characteristics) same-faith ties are significantly more likely to be sources of help in times of need, while religious discussion is a strong predictor of receiving both help and advice. The effect of religious homophily is strongest for evangelical Protestants and African-American Protestants. My findings underscore the need for social support researchers to consider the role of religion in shaping support processes in close relationships.

<title>Genotyping Oral Commensal Bacteria to Predict Social Contact and Structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0160201</url>
<snippet>Social network structure is a fundamental determinant of human health, from infectious to chronic diseases. However, quantitative and unbiased approaches to measuring social network structure are lacking. We hypothesized that genetic relatedness of oral commensal bacteria could be used to infer social contact between humans, just as genetic relatedness of pathogens can be used to determine transmission chains of pathogens. We used a traditional, questionnaire survey-based method to characterize the contact network of the School of Public Health at a large research university. We then collected saliva from a subset of individuals to analyze their oral microflora using a modified deep sequencing multilocus sequence typing (MLST) procedure. We examined micro-evolutionary changes in the S. viridans group to uncover transmission patterns reflecting social network structure. We amplified seven housekeeping gene loci from the Streptococcus viridans group, a group of ubiquitous commensal bacteria, and sequenced the PCR products using next-generation sequencing. By comparing the generated S. viridans reads between pairs of individuals, we reconstructed the social network of the sampled individuals and compared it to the network derived from the questionnaire survey-based method. The genetic relatedness significantly (p-value &lt; 0.001) correlated with social distance in the questionnaire-based network, and the reconstructed network closely matched the network derived from the questionnaire survey-based method. Oral commensal bacterial are thus likely transmitted through routine physical contact or shared environment. Their genetic relatedness can be used to represent a combination of social contact and shared physical space, therefore reconstructing networks of contact. This study provides the first step in developing a method to measure direct social contact based on commensal organism genotyping, potentially capable of unmasking hidden social networks that contribute to pathogen transmission.

<title>Reciprocation under status ambiguity: How dominance motives and spread of status value shape gift exchange</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2016.08.004</url>
<snippet>How does status ambiguity affect reciprocation in gift exchange? We argue that actors in an exchange relationship delay reciprocation as a means of subtly claiming dominance when relative status is ambiguous. Using a two-step link-tracing sample of gift exchange dyads from an online social network site in the early days of social media, we analyze the probability of two-way exchange dyads and the timing of reciprocation while accounting for the nested and autocorrelated data structure. The results support the predicted inverted-U shape relationship between the hazard of reciprocation and status difference. This pattern is strongest when actors lack common foci of interaction from which relative status could be gauged accurately. In addition, a higher status individual tends to delay reciprocation longer than a lower-status individual, a finding consistent with the status competition explanation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.102061</url>
<snippet>Online social networks (OSNs) are effusively emerging information dissemination platforms for capital market investors' as in other settings. The insinuation of OSNs for institutional investors' investment decisions in the capital market cannot be eluded in today's world. This study aims to determine the factors that influence institutional investors' capital market investing decisions and the level to which each factor influences their decision. It presents a comprehensive framework that incorporates TAM and valence frameworks while also analyzing institutional theory, resource-based view, FASB framework, and transaction cost theory. A mixed -method approach is proposed, consisting of expert interviews and a field survey. An online structured ques-tionnaire was used to perform a field survey, and 285 data points were obtained from capital market institutional investors in Bangladesh. The data was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The suggested comprehensive model outperforms previous models. Proposed factors (e.g., institutional pressure and cost -benefit dimension), as well as perceived usefulness, are strong predictors of intention to use. Indirect drivers of intention to use include another hypothesized construct (e.g., situational context) and perceived ease of use. The decision to engage in the capital market is highly influenced by the intention to use OSNs. It is worth noting that the predicted relationship between situational context and perceived usefulness, as well as the relationship between perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, are both highly significant. Stimulatingly, proposed moderators, namely organizational IS capability, significantly moderates the different relationships of the unified model. Surprisingly, perceived risk has not to impact on OSNs adoption. Theoretical and practical implications, as well as other discussions, are also presented.

<title>Climate-Change Communication Within Public Natural Resource Agencies: Lessons Learned From the US Forest Service</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2015.1107790</url>
<snippet>By analyzing interview and survey data from U.S. Forest Service employees, we examined the strategies used for communicating about climate change within the agency and their effectiveness from the perspective of agency employees. We found a limited awareness among employees regarding climate policy. We found that horizontal information flow through informal social networks was an important way in which climate-change information was communicated. We also found a lack of confidence among employees in their ability to provide feedback to agency leadership. Our results suggest that (1) agency leadership's ability to set priorities and deliver positive vision is important for increasing employee awareness and inspiring actions, (2) the agency could play a role in facilitating formal and informal networking among employees, and (3) using advanced information technologies may contribute to information flow horizontally and vertically, formally and informally.

<title>The polarization of "La Manada": the public debate in Spain and the risks of digital political communication</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.11606/0103-2070.TS.2019.159680</url>
<snippet>Several authors have raised in recent years that the new scenario generated by digital communication causes citizens to have a role with greater prominence in the public debate. However, apart from the multiple political and communicative opportunities arising from the irruption of digital social networks, we find some risks and limitations relevant to political communication such as lack of civility (Incivility). The objective of this research is to analyze, through the study of the case of "La Manada" (of great social and political repercussion in Spain) and making use of Big data techniques, the possible polarization of public debate in the social network Twitter and the existence of this type of negative practices, especially when they affect women. We find a scenario of extreme polarization in which both parties tend to use the subject of debate as a pretext to reinforce the positions that separate the left and the right in Spain.

<title>Bridging the parochial divide: Outsider brokerage in mafia families</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2023.102913</url>
<snippet>How do groups maintain internal solidarity and closure without compromising their access to diverse networks? A long line of previous research suggests focusing on the boundary-spanning activities of "brokers" who bridge gaps in social structure. In many contexts, however, brokers are viewed with suspicion and distrust rather than rewarded for their diversity of interests. This article examines groups in which the theoretical deck is seemingly stacked against brokerage and toward parochialism: American-Italian mafia families. Through an institutional analysis of the mafia organization, I trace how ethnic and organizational closure led marginalized actors to seek alternative paths to enrichment beyond the family-controlled networks and industries. Using a historical network data set, I document a division of network labor in which ethnic outsiders- more than other actors-benefited as bridges between parochial organizations. This illuminates a broader paradox of social organization: while social closure is typically thought important because it increases the group's power over individual members and reinforces boundaries, it can also undermine those same boundaries by pushing marginal actors to seek opportunities and connections outside the group.

<title>A multilevel statistical toolkit to study animal social networks: the Animal Network Toolkit Software (ANTs) R package</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69265-8</url>
<snippet>The possible role played by individual attributes, sociodemographic characteristics and/or ecological pressures in the interaction between animals and the development of social relationships between them is of great interest in animal ecology and evolutionary biology. Social Network Analysis is an ideal tool to study these types of questions. The Animal Network Toolkit Software (ANTs) R package was specifically developed to provide all the different social network analysis techniques currently used in the study of animal social networks. This global package enables users to (1) compute global, polyadic and nodal network measures; (2) perform data randomisation: data stream and network (node and link) permutations; (3) perform statistical permutation tests for static or temporal network analyses, and (4) visualise networks. ANTs allows researchers to perform multilevel network analyses ranging from individual network measures to interaction patterns and the analysis of the overall network structure, and carry out static or temporal network analyses without switching between different R packages, thus making a substantial contribution to advances in the study of animal behaviour. ANTs outperforms existing R packages for the computation speed of network measures and permutations.

<title>Homophily Through Nonreciprocity: Results of an Experiment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/sos065</url>
<snippet>This study outlines a new explanation for homophily in social networks that is neither intended nor imposed by constraints on partner choices. Rather, homophily is an endogenous product of the emergent exchange process, in which actors seek high-value partners who reciprocate their gestures. Whereas all actors initially direct exchange toward higher value partners, the gestures of lower value actors are more likely to go unreciprocated. This imbalance drives lower value actors to seek new partners, who end up being others who are also lower value. The consequence is homophily on value despite no such preference. I draw upon social exchange theory to articulate how this process unfolds in a newly forming network. A laboratory experiment tests hypotheses about how exchange patterns change over time. Findings reveal that shifts in participants' behavior over time were consistent with a concern for reciprocity, resulting in increasing levels of homophily in the network.

<title>An Experimental Study of Homophily in the Adoption of Health Behavior</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1207055</url>
<snippet>How does the composition of a population affect the adoption of health behaviors and innovations? Homophily-similarity of social contacts-can increase dyadic-level influence, but it can also force less healthy individuals to interact primarily with one another, thereby excluding them from interactions with healthier, more influential, early adopters. As a result, an important network-level effect of homophily is that the people who are most in need of a health innovation may be among the least likely to adopt it. Despite the importance of this thesis, confounding factors in observational data have made it difficult to test empirically. We report results from a controlled experimental study on the spread of a health innovation through fixed social networks in which the level of homophily was independently varied. We found that homophily significantly increased overall adoption of a new health behavior, especially among those most in need of it.

<title>Team efficiency and network structure: The case of professional League of Legends</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.03.004</url>
<snippet>Teams can be defined by their interactions and successful performance rests on their members' behaviour. Although this topic has been studied both in sports and management, research on computer mediated team interactions, communication, cooperative work and efficiency in online competitive environments is scarce. In this article, networks will be used as a novel approach to understand how League of Legends professional players assist each other during a competitive match and to link their computer mediated behaviour and social interactions to their teams performance. Starting from a dataset consisting of 453.386 kill assists, the network structure and efficiency is assessed over 7.582 matches in total. After controlling for potential mixed-effects, such as the quality of the involved teams or their geography, this study reinforces previous research showing that team efficiency in the League of Legends professional scene is positively affected by the intensity of their interaction while centralization of resources is detrimental. Networks with high intensity and low inner centralization are, therefore, related to a higher performance as a team not only in traditional sports but also in computer mediated contexts.

<title>Social Affiliation from Religious Disaffiliation: Evidence of Selective Mixing Among Youth with No Religious Preference During the Transition to College</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12227</url>
<snippet>The number of individuals claiming a nonreligious identity in the United States is on the rise, with one-fourth of the overall U.S. public failing to identify with any of the major religious traditions. In this article, we examine whether religious disaffiliation structures social network formation in a social context in which religious identification (and religiosity) is a salient cultural marker. We take advantage of unique data on the personal networks of youth transitioning into a college where religion is a culturally salient facet of everyday life. We hypothesize that, if there is nonreligious homophily, it may result from an attraction of the disaffiliated to each other or from a repulsion away from the religiously affiliated. Results of exponential random graph models suggest that both mechanisms may be at play. We find that religious Nones and affiliated non-Catholics are disproportionately more likely to form and maintain relationships with one another and are relatively less likely to form and maintain relationships with members of their respective religious out-groups. We close by outlining the implications of our findings and delineating promising avenues for future research.

<title>Exploring and visualizing spatial-temporal evolution of patent collaboration networks: A case of China?s intelligent manufacturing equipment industry</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101483</url>
<snippet>With the integration of intelligent manufacturing (IM) technology and the manufacturing industry, the intelligent manufacturing equipment industry (IMEI) has become the focus of a new round of industrial revolution. This integration has led to a new revolution in the manufacturing industry and is key to transforming China into a manufacturing country with international competitiveness. However, China?s IMEI is in the development stage, thus presenting a major challenge to it becoming a competitive core industry. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore the IMEI patent collaboration network and analyze its evolutionary characteristics, which can improve not only the innovation ability of network organizations but also the overall competitiveness of the IMEI. This study employs social network analysis (SNA) to study the evolution of the patent collaboration network of China?s IMEI. The results show that the number of co-patents for the IMEI field in China has obvious stage characteristics, the collaborative innovation patterns adopted by different provinces vary, and the State Grid has a strong influence on the network. The scale of the patent collaboration network is gradually expanding, exhibiting a ?small-world? structure. Jiangsu mainly innovates through intra-provincial collaboration. Provinces such as Beijing, Guangdong and Shandong are more inclined to inter-provincial collaboration.

<title>Modeling and Analyzing Information Propagation Evolution Integrating Internal and External Influences</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adts.202300845</url>
<snippet>Online social networks have revolutionized communication, providing individuals with platforms to express their personal opinions on diverse topics. Researchers have independently explored information propagation and opinion evolution within complex networks. However, these phenomena exhibit interconnectedness, where information dissemination influences opinion evolution and vice versa. To address challenges in complex network modeling and opinion-information coupling, internal and external factors are considered in public opinion scenarios by incorporating the crowd effect, enhancement effect, and evolutionary game theory. The susceptible-latent-forwarding-immune-Jager-Amblard (SLFI-JA) model is presented by modifying the SLFI propagation dynamics model and the JA opinion dynamics model, enabling the integration of information propagation and opinion evolution at the microlevel. Through analyzing real-world social hotspots on Sina Weibo, case studies and comparative analyses are conducted to validate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed model. Furthermore, the findings identify key factors influencing public opinion dissemination and group opinion evolution, offering valuable insights to relevant departments in public opinion response and management. The study aims to mitigate the harmful effects of negative public opinions, prevent extreme adverse online events, and foster a healthier online environment. Online social networks have revolutionized communication, providing individuals with platforms to express opinions on diverse topics. Through considering internal and external factors, the SLFI-JA model is presented, enabling the integration of information propagation and opinion evolution at the micro-level.image

<title>The winner takes it all-Competitiveness of single nodes in globalized supply networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225346</url>
<snippet>Quantifying the importance and power of individual nodes depending on their position in socio-economic networks constitutes a problem across a variety of applications. Examples include the reach of individuals in (online) social networks, the importance of individual banks or loans in financial networks, the relevance of individual companies in supply networks, and the role of traffic hubs in transport networks. Which features characterize the importance of a node in a trade network during the emergence of a globalized, connected market? Here we analyze a model that maps the evolution of global connectivity in a supply network to a percolation problem. In particular, we focus on the influence of topological features of the node within the underlying transport network. Our results reveal that an advantageous position with respect to different length scales determines the competitiveness of a node at different stages of the percolation process and depending on the speed of the cluster growth.

<title>ISBP: Understanding the Security Rule of Users' Information-Sharing Behaviors in Partnership</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0151002</url>
<snippet>The rapid growth of social network data has given rise to high security awareness among users, especially when they exchange and share their personal information. However, because users have different feelings about sharing their information, they are often puzzled about who their partners for exchanging information can be and what information they can share. Is it possible to assist users in forming a partnership network in which they can exchange and share information with little worry? We propose a modified information sharing behavior prediction (ISBP) model that can help in understanding the underlying rules by which users share their information with partners in light of three common aspects: what types of items users are likely to share, what characteristics of users make them likely to share information, and what features of users' sharing behavior are easy to predict. This model is applied with machine learning techniques in WEKA to predict users' decisions pertaining to information sharing behavior and form them into trustable partnership networks by learning their features. In the experiment section, by using two real-life datasets consisting of citizens' sharing behavior, we identify the effect of highly sensitive requests on sharing behavior adjacent to individual variables: the younger participants' partners are more difficult to predict than those of the older participants, whereas the partners of people who are not computer majors are easier to predict than those of people who are computer majors. Based on these findings, we believe that it is necessary and feasible to offer users personalized suggestions on information sharing decisions, and this is pioneering work that could benefit college researchers focusing on user-centric strategies and website owners who want to collect more user information without raising their privacy awareness or losing their trustworthiness.

<title>Stingy bots can improve human welfare in experimental sharing networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-44883-0</url>
<snippet>Machines powered by artificial intelligence increasingly permeate social networks with control over resources. However, machine allocation behavior might offer little benefit to human welfare over networks when it ignores the specific network mechanism of social exchange. Here, we perform an online experiment involving simple networks of humans (496 participants in 120 networks) playing a resource-sharing game to which we sometimes add artificial agents (bots). The experiment examines two opposite policies of machine allocation behavior: reciprocal bots, which share all resources reciprocally; and stingy bots, which share no resources at all. We also manipulate the bot's network position. We show that reciprocal bots make little changes in unequal resource distribution among people. On the other hand, stingy bots balance structural power and improve collective welfare in human groups when placed in a specific network position, although they bestow no wealth on people. Our findings highlight the need to incorporate the human nature of reciprocity and relational interdependence in designing machine behavior in sharing networks. Conscientious machines do not always work for human welfare, depending on the network structure where they interact.

<title>Same old story with a different ending: Homophily and preferential selection of information within the US climate policy network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0306454</url>
<snippet>The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act has been perceived as a substantial shift away from the history of more contentious climate politics in the US. We apply social network methods to interrogate an updated dataset that assesses the degree to which recent policy outcomes are a shift away from earlier policies and positions. We empirically test for homophily, a building block of polarisation, analysing four waves of survey data collected over 12 years from the community of political elites engaged in the issue of climate politics. Using Exponential Random Graph (ERG) modeling, we provide clear evidence that the stances of the top policy actors working on climate change have not shifted substantially. Instead, we document how the policy was successful due to its ability to combine the Administration's desire to support clean energy along with fossil fuel interests' aims of expanding extraction and profiting from a transition away from fossil fuels.

<title>How prepared are we for cross-border outbreaks? An exploratory analysis of cross-border response networks for outbreaks of multidrug resistant microorganisms in the Netherlands and Germany</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219548</url>
<snippet>Background The emergence and spread of multidrug resistant microorganisms is a serious threat to transnational public health. Therefore, it is vital that cross-border outbreak response systems are constantly prepared for fast, rigorous, and efficient response. This research aims to improve transnational collaboration by identifying, visualizing, and exploring two cross-border response networks that are likely to unfold during outbreaks involving the Netherlands and Germany. Methods Quantitative methods were used to explore response networks during a cross-border outbreak of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae in healthcare settings. Eighty-six Dutch and German health professionals reflected on a fictive but realistic outbreak scenario (response rate approximate to 70&#37;). Data were collected regarding collaborative relationships between stakeholders during outbreak response, prior working relationships, and trust in the networks. Network analysis techniques were used to analyze the networks on the network level (density, centralization, clique structures, and similarity of tie constellations between two networks) and node level (brokerage measures and degree centrality). Results Although stakeholders mainly collaborate with stakeholders belonging to the same country, transnational collaboration is present in a centralized manner. Integration of the network is reached, since several actors are beneficially positioned to coordinate transnational collaboration. However, levels of trust are moderately low and prior-existing cross-border working relationships are sparse. Conclusion Given the explored network characteristics, we conclude that the system has a promising basis to achieve effective coordination. However, future research has to determine what kind of network governance form might be most effective and efficient in coordinating the necessary cross-border response activity. Furthermore, networks identified in this study are not only crucial in times of outbreak containment, but should also be fostered in times of non-crisis.

<title>The Network Dynamics of Status: Assimilation and Selection</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/sox040</url>
<snippet>Using longitudinal data that we have collected on friendship and advice relations in a cohort of MBA students, we examine how status affects the dynamics of network ties among peers. Estimates of Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs) suggest that status is a consequence of network ties because over time the level of status attributed to individual students by other students tends to the average level of status attributed to their network partners-a phenomenon we call status assimilation. Status is also an antecedent to network ties because it affects partner selection decisions, giving rise to distinct forms of social attachment. We find that both network-based processes of status assimilation, as well as status-based processes of social selection, are present, but they vary subtly yet significantly across network domains. Students tend to the average level of status of their friends, but not to that of their advisors. High-status students are more active in the friendship network, but more popular in the advice network. We find evidence of performance homophily rather than status homophily: students with similar grades are more likely to exchange friendship and advice ties. High-status students tend to be more central in the advice network, but status attributions spill over through friendship, rather than advice relations. The study documents how the relation between social status and social networks varies both over time, as well as across network domains. The study also demonstrates the importance of accounting for multiplexity-the tendency of a network to operate through another.

<title>A multilayer approach to multiplexity and link prediction in online geo-social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0087-z</url>
<snippet>Online social systems are multiplex in nature as multiple links may exist between the same two users across different social media. In this work, we study the geo-social properties of multiplex links, spanning more than one social network and apply their structural and interaction features to the problem of link prediction across social networking services. Exploring the intersection of two popular online platforms Twitter and location-based social network Foursquare - we represent the two together as a composite multilayer online social network, where each platform represents a layer in the network. We find that pairs of users connected on both services, have greater neighbourhood similarity and are more similar in terms of their social and spatial properties on both platforms in comparison with pairs who are connected on just one of the social networks. Our evaluation, which aims to shed light on the implications of multiplexity for the link generation process, shows that we can successfully predict links across social networking services. In addition, we also show how combining information from multiple heterogeneous networks in a multilayer configuration can provide new insights into user interactions on online social networks, and can significantly improve link prediction systems with valuable applications to social bootstrapping and friend recommendations.

<title>The structure of risk-sharing networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00181-021-02037-z</url>
<snippet>We examine the structure of risk-sharing networks in developing countries using data from the Tanzanian village of Nyakatoke. We first show that the Nyakatoke network exhibits: (1) the "small-world" phenomenon, where two households who are not themselves risk-sharing partners are separated only by a short chain of intermediaries; (2) preferential attachment, which is a network formation process where the probability of a household receiving a partner is proportional to that household's existing number of partners; and (3) assortative mixing, as similarly connected households tend to link to each other. We then examine the implications of these features for network performance by comparing the Nyakatoke network to simulated networks with alternative structural traits. Our simulations show that the Nyakatoke network displays optimal or near-optimal performance along multiple dimensions. In particular, the Nyakatoke network has a notable ability to withstand perturbations of multiple types, a property that none of the counterfactual networks possess.

<title>Networks never rest: An investigation of network evolution in three species of animals</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.09.002</url>
<snippet>Despite considerable advancement in the study of network evolution, three basic limitations are common to the data collected: (1) examining a small number of networks, (2) not observing networks from scratch, (3) not collecting time-stamped, continuous records of all interactions among all members of groups. Here, we avoid these limitations by observing all aggressive interactions leading to network formation from the moment of introduction among all members of 45 groups of four individuals each in three species of animals: chickens, cichlid fish, and mice. We apply several recently developed methods for the visualization and analysis of network evolution to these unique datasets. We discover, first, that network evolution is a remarkably dynamic process across all three species: networks do not evolve to specific structures and then remain in those configurations. Instead, we find dynamic stability in which many groups continually return to a general class of structures. Second, we find considerable similarity across species in the pathways that the groups take through different possible network configurations as they evolve. Third, we show that transitive component triads are more stable than intransitive ones. Fourth, we track the evolution of individual ranks within groups and discover that many individuals do not have stable positions. Finally, we discuss fundamental questions that our findings raise for the study of networks in both animals and humans.

<title>Collaboration Networks in Applied Conservation Projects across Europe</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164503</url>
<snippet>The main funding instrument for implementing EU policies on nature conservation and supporting environmental and climate action is the LIFE Nature programme, established by the European Commission in 1992. LIFE Nature projects (&gt;1400 awarded) are applied conservation projects in which partnerships between institutions are critical for successful conservation outcomes, yet little is known about the structure of collaborative networks within and between EU countries. The aim of our study is to understand the nature of collaboration in LIFE Nature projects using a novel application of social network theory at two levels: (1) collaboration between countries, and (2) collaboration within countries using six case studies: Western Europe (United Kingdom and Netherlands), Eastern Europe (Romania and Latvia) and Southern Europe (Greece and Portugal). Using data on 1261 projects financed between 1996 and 2013, we found that Italy was the most successful country not only in terms of awarded number of projects, but also in terms of overall influence being by far the most influent country in the European LIFE Nature network, having the highest eigenvector (0.989) and degree centrality (0.177). Another key player in the network is Netherlands, which ensures a fast communication flow with other network members (closeness-0.318) by staying connected with the most active countries. Although Western European countries have higher centrality scores than most of the Eastern European countries, our results showed that overall there is a lower tendency to create partnerships between different organization categories. Also, the comparisons of the six case studies indicates significant differences in regards to the pattern of creating partnerships, providing valuable information on collaboration on EU nature conservation. This study represents a starting point in predicting the formation of future partnerships within LIFE Nature programme, suggesting ways to improve transnational cooperation and communication.

<title>The evolving cobweb of relations among partially rational investors</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0171891</url>
<snippet>To overcome the limitations of neoclassical economics, researchers have leveraged tools of statistical physics to build novel theories. The idea was to elucidate the macroscopic features of financial markets from the interaction of its microscopic constituents, the investors. In this framework, the model of the financial agents has been kept separate from that of their interaction. Here, instead, we explore the possibility of letting the interaction topology emerge from the model of the agents' behavior. Then, we investigate how the emerging cobweb of relationship affects the overall market dynamics. To this aim, we leverage tools from complex systems analysis and nonlinear dynamics, and model the network of mutual influence as the output of a dynamical system describing the edge evolution. In this work, the driver of the link evolution is the relative reputation between possibly coupled agents. The reputation is built differently depending on the extent of rationality of the investors. The continuous edge activation or deactivation induces the emergence of leaders and of peculiar network structures, typical of real influence networks. The subsequent impact on the market dynamics is investigated through extensive numerical simulations in selected scenarios populated by partially rational investors.

<title>Volume explored by a branching random walk on general graphs</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51225-6</url>
<snippet>Branching processes are used to model diverse social and physical scenarios, from extinction of family names to nuclear fission. However, for a better description of natural phenomena, such as viral epidemics in cellular tissues, animal populations and social networks, a spatial embedding-the branching random walk (BRW)-is required. Despite its wide range of applications, the properties of the volume explored by the BRW so far remained elusive, with exact results limited to one dimension. Here we present analytical results, supported by numerical simulations, on the scaling of the volume explored by a BRW in the critical regime, the onset of epidemics, in general environments. Our results characterise the spreading dynamics on regular lattices and general graphs, such as fractals, random trees and scale-free networks, revealing the direct relation between the graphs' dimensionality and the rate of propagation of the viral process. Furthermore, we use the BRW to determine the spectral properties of real social and metabolic networks, where we observe that a lack of information of the network structure can lead to differences in the observed behaviour of the spreading process. Our results provide observables of broad interest for the characterisation of real world lattices, tissues, and networks.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2015.01.003</url>
<snippet>How might people's moment-to-moment feelings influence the social network contacts they call to mind? Three datasets indicate that experiencing positive affect leads people to cognitively activate larger and more sparsely connected social network structures, while experiencing negative affect leads them to activate smaller, redundant social network structures. A preliminary association emerged between positive affect and activating large, diversified network structures in the General Social Survey. To isolate causality, we then conducted two experiments where we randomly assigned participants to experience either positive or negative affect. Both studies supported the hypothesized relationship between affect and cognitive network activation. These findings contribute to a burgeoning literature examining how psychological states shape the activation of social network structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Stewardship of global collective behavior</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2025764118</url>
<snippet>Collective behavior provides a framework for understanding how the actions and properties of groups emerge from the way individuals generate and share information. In humans, information flows were initially shaped by natural selection yet are increasingly structured by emerging communication technologies. Our larger, more complex social networks now transfer high-fidelity information over vast distances at low cost. The digital age and the rise of social media have accelerated changes to our social systems, with poorly understood functional consequences. This gap in our knowledge represents a principal challenge to scientific progress, democracy, and actions to address global crises. We argue that the study of collective behavior must rise to a "crisis discipline" just as medicine, conservation, and climate science have, with a focus on providing actionable insight to policymakers and regulators for the stewardship of social systems.

<title>Towards a Methodology for Validation of Centrality Measures in Complex Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090283</url>
<snippet>Background: Living systems are associated with Social networks - networks made up of nodes, some of which may be more important in various aspects as compared to others. While different quantitative measures labeled as "centralities'' have previously been used in the network analysis community to find out influential nodes in a network, it is debatable how valid the centrality measures actually are. In other words, the research question that remains unanswered is: how exactly do these measures perform in the real world? So, as an example, if a centrality of a particular node identifies it to be important, is the node actually important? Purpose: The goal of this paper is not just to perform a traditional social network analysis but rather to evaluate different centrality measures by conducting an empirical study analyzing exactly how do network centralities correlate with data from published multidisciplinary network data sets. Method: We take standard published network data sets while using a random network to establish a baseline. These data sets included the Zachary's Karate Club network, dolphin social network and a neural network of nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Each of the data sets was analyzed in terms of different centrality measures and compared with existing knowledge from associated published articles to review the role of each centrality measure in the determination of influential nodes. Results: Our empirical analysis demonstrates that in the chosen network data sets, nodes which had a high Closeness Centrality also had a high Eccentricity Centrality. Likewise high Degree Centrality also correlated closely with a high Eigenvector Centrality. Whereas Betweenness Centrality varied according to network topology and did not demonstrate any noticeable pattern. In terms of identification of key nodes, we discovered that as compared with other centrality measures, Eigenvector and Eccentricity Centralities were better able to identify important nodes.

<title>The Political Complexity of Regional Electricity Policy Formation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/3493492</url>
<snippet>The integration of renewable power supplies into existing electrical grids, or other major technology transitions in electric power, is a complex sociotechnical process. While the technical challenges are well-understood, the process of adapting electricity policy and market rules to these new technologies is understudied. Planning and market rules are a critical determinant of the technical success of renewable energy integration efforts and the financial viability of renewable energy investments. Organizational adaptation can be particularly complex in electric power, where transmission grids cross multiple political boundaries and decisions are made not by central authorities or governments, but in cooperative regional frameworks that must accommodate many divergent interests. We add to a recently emerging literature on the governance of regional organizations that plan and operate electric power grids by developing and illustrating a novel approach to the study of political power in multistakeholder electricity organizations. We use semistructured interviews with participants in a specific regional electric grid authority, the PJM Regional Transmission Operator in the Mid-Atlantic United States, to elicit perceptions of where tensions arise in stakeholder-driven processes for changing PJM's rules and perceptions of those groups of stakeholders that possess political power. We treat these perceptions as hypotheses that can be evaluated empirically using five years of data from PJM on how stakeholders voted on a wide variety of regional electricity policy issues. Representing voting behavior as a network, we use a community detection method to identify strong coalitions of stakeholders in PJM that provide support for some stakeholder perceptions of political power and refute other perceptions. The degree distribution of the voting network exhibits a fat tail relative to those in other canonical graph models. We show, using relatively simple network metrics including degree, betweenness, and the mixing parameter, that the reason for this fat tail in the degree distribution is the existence of swing voters in RTO stakeholder networks. These voters are identifiable in the tail of the degree distribution of the voting network and are influential in pushing highly contentious rule change proposals towards passage or failure. The method we develop is generalizable to other contexts and provides a new framework for the study of regional electricity policy formation.

<title>Modeling a Rumor Propagation in Online Social Network: An Optimal Control Approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/6724815</url>
<snippet>We propose to model the phenomenon of the spread of a rumor in social networks in this paper. From an existingSIRmodel, we manipulate a new one that is based on the model of cholera in order to take into account professional pages that specialize in spreading rumors. In the second part, we introduce a control strategy to fight against the diffusion of the rumor. Our main objective is to characterize the three optimal controls that minimize the number of spreader users, fake pages, and the corresponding costs. For that matter, using the maximum principle of Pontryagin, we prove the existence and we give characterization of our controls. Numerical simulations are given to concretize our approach.

<snippet>Structural holes theory suggests a variety of possible explanations for the empirically observed relationship between structural holes and individual managerial performance. However, little has been done to disentangle one mechanism from another. This paper empirically tests a mediated moderation model that distinguishes between the five different theoretical mechanisms: autonomy, competition, information brokering, opportunity recognition and innovativeness. The findings suggest that of these five theoretical causal motors, innovativeness plays a key role in linking network structure and network content to performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

<title>Examining the Intergovernmental and Interorganizational Network of Responding to Major Accidents for Improving the Emergency Management System in China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/8935872</url>
<snippet>Since the SARS crisis in 2003, institutionalized emergency management systems have been established in each government level for improving inter-organizational collaboration in China. Major accidents require participation of public organizations affiliated with multiple government levels, and the lack of collaboration and coordination among the involved organizations within the critical time constraints during the response process is an existing problem. In this research, a case study of examining the intergovernmental and cross-sectoral collaboration for responding to a well-known oil pipeline explosion accident in China by a complex network method is conducted. The aim is to obtain managerial insights in improving the existing emergency management system in a centralized political-administrative context, such as China. A mixed method of data collection is applied to identify the participating organizations and to determine the interaction spanning organizational boundaries in both hierarchical and horizontal dimensions. An emergency response network is built and visualized for representing intergovernmental and interorganizational collaboration during the response process of the major accident by social network analysis (SNA) tools. The SNA indicators are used to measure quantitatively the network structure at the levels of the whole network, subnetwork, and node. The obstacles of achieving intergovernmental collaboration are found, and managerial suggestions for improving the existing emergency management system are provided. This research indicates that the Chinese government should pay attention to establishing and sustaining partnerships with private and nonprofit organizations and conduct a blend of hierarchical, market, and network principles in fostering collaboration for addressing major accidents. The public organizations in the local government level are shown to be more active than other participators in coordinating their response operations, and their capability should be emphasized for improvement. Additionally, the interactive relationships among specific emergency function groups and between the affected communities and organizations performing emergency command and coordination function should be strengthened.

<title>Airbnb on TikTok: Brand Perception Through User Engagement and Sentiment Trends</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393241260242</url>
<snippet>This study delves into Airbnb's brand presence on TikTok by analyzing textual content in posts, and human audio in videos. This approach aims to decipher the brand narrative and gauge user engagement. In the dynamic realm of social media marketing, TikTok has emerged as a key platform in shaping brand perception. This research specifically concentrates on Airbnb's content, distinguishing between official narratives and user-generated content (UGC). Notably, themes of "Travel" dominate official posts, contrasting with "Real Estate" and "Business" in UGC. The methodology employed involves advanced data collection techniques, including web scraping for textual data and artificial intelligence for transcribing human audio to text. The findings reveal that UGC commands greater engagement and volume compared to Airbnb's own brand content, underscoring the increasing significance of user involvement in brand storytelling. An analysis of the study results is conducted using linguistic natural processing (LNP) for the sentiment base, and the vector space model for emotion analysis. Sentiment analysis reveals a predominance of the emotion "happiness" and a significant presence of "surprise" in the posts, both of which are critical for audience engagement. Moreover, the study indicates a high approval rate for Airbnb-related content, reflecting a positive reception of the brand. Additionally, the research observes that influencers, particularly nano influencers, have higher engagement rates, indicating that their authenticity and relatability appeal especially to Generation Z audiences. This study not only sheds light on the intricate relationship between brand narrative, user engagement, and sentiment on TikTok but also offers valuable insights into effective brand image construction and propagation in the digital era, highlighting the importance of diverse emotions in enhancing audience engagement.

<title>Geographical variability and network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2011.08.003</url>
<snippet>In this paper, we explore the potential implications of geographical variability for the structure of social networks. Beginning with some basic simplifying assumptions, we derive a number of ways in which local network structure should be expected to vary across a region whose population is unevenly distributed. To examine the manner in which these effects would be expected to manifest given realistic population distributions, we then perform an exploratory simulation study that examines the features of large-scale interpersonal networks generated using block-level data from the 2000 U.S. Census. Using a stratified sample of micropolitan and metropolitan areas with populations ranging from approximately 1000 to 1,000,000 persons, we extrapolatively simulate network structure using spatial network models calibrated to two fairly proximate social relations. From this sample of simulated networks, we examine the effect of both within-location and between-location heterogeneity on a variety of structural properties. As we demonstrate, geographical variability produces large and distinctive features in the "social fabric" that overlies it; at the same time, however, many aggregate network properties can be fairly well-predicted from relatively simple spatial demographic variables. The impact of geographical variability is thus predicted to depend substantially on the type of network property being assessed, and on the spatial scale involved. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

<title>Modeling and analyzing network dynamics of COVID-19 vaccine information propagation in the Chinese Sina Microblog</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-024-09386-x</url>
<snippet>Information about the vaccine is usually spread through heterogeneous networks in reality, where public opinion bursts out faster than in homogeneous networks. Considering the complexity of heterogeneous networks, we develop a network susceptible-forwarding-immune (NET-SFI) model to describe the patterns of information propagation in the actual social network. Classifying the states of nodes according to the number of users can contact in the social network, the NET-SFI model focuses on the network structure and user heterogeneity. We adopt a data-model drive method to conduct the model validation including two types of COVID-19 vaccine information from the Chinese Sina Microblog. Our parameter sensitivity analyses show the important significance of node degree in causing the outbreak of public opinion. Moreover, corresponding conclusions based on our analytic study are conducive to designing valid strategies for vaccine information dissemination.

<title>Individual personality predicts social network assemblages in a colonial bird</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-29315-3</url>
<snippet>Animal personalities manifest as consistent individual differences in the performance of specific behavioural expressions. Personality research has implications for zoo animal welfare, as it can further our understanding of how captive individuals may differ in their resource use and provide insight into improving individual and group social health. For group living species, personality may enable assortment based on similar behaviour and influence an individual's interactions with conspecifics (e.g. social support). This research aimed to document how personality traits (aggressive, exploratory, submissive) influenced the social network structure of highly social animals in a captive environment. Data were collected from separate flocks of captive Caribbean (Phoenicopterus ruber) and Chilean flamingos (Phoenicopterus chilensis) to identify relationships between birds and examine opportunities for social support. The flocks associated non-randomly, and in both cases, personality was a substantial predictor of network structure. Personality also predicted key elements of Caribbean flamingo social role (degree, betweenness and average association strength) conflict outcome, and propensity to provide social support, however these patterns were not replicated within the Chilean flamingo network. While both species appear to assort by personality, the broader relationship between personality and social role may vary depending on species and context.

<title>The Ethnic Lens: Social Networks and the Salience of Ethnicity in the School Context</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.15195/v10.a22</url>
<snippet>Research on ethnic segregation in schools regularly assumed that ethnic homophily-the tendency to befriend same-ethnic peers, above and beyond other mechanisms of tie formation-is associated with salient ethnic boundaries. We devise a more direct test of this assumption based on a novel measure of ethno-racial group perceptions. In a network study of more than 3000 students in 39 schools of a metropolitan region in Germany, we asked students to indicate which cliques they perceived in their school grade and to describe these groups in their own words. We find that ethno-racial labels are more likely directed at larger cliques that include a higher share of Muslim students or more students with stronger ethnic identification. Still, ethno-racial labels are rarely employed, both absolutely and relative to other modes of classification. Moreover, net ethnic segregation in friendships ("ethnic homophily") and the reverse pattern in dislike relations ("ethnic heterophobia") are not associated with a more frequent use of ethno-racial labels. Our results have substantive and methodological implications for the study of social networks and diversity in educational settings.

<title>The social structure of trust</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-8733(98)00005-7</url>
<snippet>This paper addresses the way in which the level of trust in cooperative relations depends on network structures. The study is an elaboration of models developed in earlier papers using iterated games [Weesie, J., Buskens, V., Raub, W., 1998. The management of trust relations via institutional and structural embeddedness. Journal of Mathematical Sociology (in press); Buskens, V., 1995. Social Networks and the Effect of Reputation on Cooperation. ISCORE Paper No. 42, Utrecht University]. We distinguish individual and group network measures. Applying a combination of approximation methods to the game-theoretic solution to the model, we derive hypotheses on the effects of density, outdegree centrality, and centralization on the level of trust a truster can have in a trustee. We conclude that higher density and outdegree induce more trust. Centralization increases trust if it is 'well organized,' i.e., actors who can place more trust are central in the network. Furthermore, we discuss theoretical evidence that the relative importance of density compared to outdegree increases if the trust problem at the dyadic level is large. Finally, we show that, in many situations, a few simple network measures explain most of the effects of the network structure as a whole. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

<snippet>In this paper we propose a new method for studying local and global clustering in networks employing random walk pairs. The method is intuitive and directly generalizes standard local and global clustering coefficients to weighted networks and networks containing nodes of multiple types. In the case of two mode networks the values obtained for commonly considered social networks are in sharp contrast to those obtained, for instance, by the method of Opsahl (2013), and provide a different viewpoint for clustering. The approach is also applicable in questions related to the general study of segregation and homophily. Applications to existent data sets are considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000169939403700404</url>
<snippet>Network models of market competition are used to advance from two significant research efforts; Lawrence gi Lorsch's (1967) demonstration that the optimum form of organization varies between markets, and Kotter and Heskett's (1992) study of corporate culture and performance. We compare firms in terms of their economic performance, the extent to which they have a strong corporate culture, and the network structure of their market. The value of a strong corporate culture varies between markets; nothing in one market, an asset in more competitive markets. From the variation between markets, we build a culture-performance contingency function that uses the network structure of a firm's market to predict the extent to which a strong corporate culture can be expected to enhance the firm's performance. With the contingency function, and market census data, we infer that the correlation between culture and performance is strong in the American economy, especially in manufacturing. We also use the function to identify reasonable samples of organizations in which the correlation will be weak, The contingency function is an interesting substantive phenomenon in its own right and a valuable analytical tool for generalizing results on sample firms to population conditions.

<title>Defending against Online Social Network Rumors through Optimal Control Approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/6263748</url>
<snippet>Rumors have been widely spread in online social networks and they become a major concern in modern society. This paper is devoted to the design of a cost-effective rumor-containing scheme in online social networks through an optimal control approach. First, a new individual-based rumor spreading model is proposed, and the model considers the influence of the external environment on rumor spreading for the first time. Second, the cost-effectiveness is recommended to balance the loss caused by rumors against the cost of a rumor-containing scheme. On this basis, we reduce the original problem to an optimal control model. Next, we prove that this model is solvable, and we present the optimality system for the model. Finally, we show that the resulting rumor-containing scheme is cost-effective through extensive computer experiments.

<title>Crafting Mosaics: Person-Centered Religious Influence and Selection in Adolescent Friendships</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12638</url>
<snippet>This research addresses the intersection of two key domains of adolescents' lives: religion and peer networks. Religion scholars argue that religion is multi-faceted and better understood by focusing on combinations of indicators (i.e., mosaics), versus a variable-centered approach. We adopt this framework and investigate the interplay between religion and peer networks, both in how religious mosaics are shaped by friends and how religious profiles affect friend selection dynamics. With data from two schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate religious mosaics using latent class analysis (LCA) to identify profiles consisting of combinations of commonly available survey-based measures of religious attitudes, behaviors, and identities. Finding evidence of theoretically expected profiles, we then use stochastic actor-based models (SABMs) to investigate network dynamics for these LCA-based religious profiles. We demonstrate how the profile data can be integrated within the SABM framework to evaluate processes of friend selection and influence. Results show evidence of adolescents influencing one another's religious mosaics, but not selecting friends on that basis.

<title>Algorithms for seeding social networks can enhance the adoption of a public health intervention in urban India</title>

<snippet>Targeting structurally influential individuals within social networks can enhance adoption of health interventions within populations. We tested the effectiveness of two algorithms to improve social contagion that do not require knowledge of the whole network structure. We mapped the social interactions of 2,491 women in 50 residential buildings (chawls) in Mumbai, India. The buildings, which are social units, were randomized to (1) targeting 20&#37; of the women at random, (2) targeting friends of such randomly chosen women, (3) targeting pairs of people composed of randomly chosen women and a friend, or (4) no targeting. Both targeting algorithms, friendship nomination and pair targeting, enhanced adoption of a public health intervention related to the use of iron-fortified salt for anemia. In particular, the targeting of pairs of friends, which is relatively easily implementable in field settings, enhanced adoption of novel practices through both social influence and social reinforcement.

<snippet>Social networks are heavily implicated in large-scale social transformations. They are both transformed and transformative. We review the ways in which social networks act as agents of change in macrohistorical processes, stressing two distinct theoretical approaches. Formalism analyzes the structure of networks. Relationalism evaluates the linking properties of networks. Using these two approaches to organize the literature, we present the current state of knowledge on the effects of social networks for four central macrohistorical outcomes: civil uprising, state formation, global and national policy formation and diffusion, and economic development and increasing inequality. We then consider new theoretical advances in institutional emergence and methodological innovations in computational modeling and their potential for reconciling and advancing existing findings and approaches on the effects of social networks on macrosocial change.

<title>An Efficient Competitive Control Mechanism for Negative Information Spread in Online Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218127424501724</url>
<snippet>In online social networks (OSNs), the spread of negative information can cause social shocks, endanger public safety and harm public interests. In this paper, to reduce the impact of negative information on the network ecosystem as much as possible, we consider a competitive strategy of mainstream media coverage and construct a competitively regulated reaction-diffusion model of negative information transmission. For this model, we obtain the basic reproduction number of information propagation, the invade numbers of negative information and positive information. Besides, the local and global stabilities of equilibrium states are discussed. Further, steady bifurcation analyses from a positive information equilibrium and a negative information equilibrium are carried out. Finally, we present some numerical simulations to verify the theoretical analysis results and discuss how spatial heterogeneity affects the process of information diffusion. The conclusions are as follows: Increasing the spread of positive information, controlling the spatial heterogeneity of the transmission rate and reducing the diffusion coefficient when spatial heterogeneous transmission rate occurs are beneficial for suppressing the spread of negative information.

<title>Climate adaptation pathways and the role of social-ecological networks in small-scale fisheries</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18668-w</url>
<snippet>Climate change is expected to have increasing impacts on marine ecosystems which will threaten the livelihoods and wellbeing of millions of people. Drawing on social-ecological network and sociodemographic data collected via face-to-face interviews with 404 small-scale commercial fishers from 9 Galician communities (Spain), we empirically examine the adaptation pathways that fishers follow when they face hypothetical impacts on their fishery resources and test the role of five social-ecological network structures on fisher's stated intended responses to such scenarios. Our results show that fishers generally intend to follow a 'remain-adapt-transform-exit (the fishery)' pathway when faced with increasing climate impacts. Next, we demonstrate that trust-based bonding ties and ties to informal leaders are associated with a 'business-as-usual' strategy. In contrast, communicative bonding ties are associated with adaptive responses, while communicative bridging ties are associated with transformative and exit strategies. Our findings provide key empirical insight that broaden our understanding of the intricate relationship between social networks and adaptive behaviour relevant to social-ecological systems worldwide.

<title>Brain connectivity dynamics during social interaction reflect social network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1616130114</url>
<snippet>Social ties are crucial for humans. Disruption of ties through social exclusion has a marked effect on our thoughts and feelings; however, such effects can be tempered by broader social network resources. Here, we use fMRI data acquired from 80 male adolescents to investigate how social exclusion modulates functional connectivity within and across brain networks involved in social pain and understanding the mental states of others (i.e., mentalizing). Furthermore, using objectively logged friendship network data, we examine how individual variability in brain reactivity to social exclusion relates to the density of participants' friendship networks, an important aspect of social network structure. We find increased connectivity within a set of regions previously identified as a mentalizing system during exclusion relative to inclusion. These results are consistent across the regions of interest as well as a whole-brain analysis. Next, examining how social network characteristics are associated with task-based connectivity dynamics, we find that participants who showed greater changes in connectivity within the mentalizing system when socially excluded by peers had less dense friendship networks. This work provides insight to understand how distributed brain systems respond to social and emotional challenges and how such brain dynamics might vary based on broader social network characteristics.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09500170231199415</url>
<snippet>This article focuses on the London Metropolitan Police Service, an organization charged with being institutionally racist. It asks why the percentage of black officers in senior positions remains so low, despite explicit formal attempts to change this situation. Rather than concentrating on the factors holding back the recruitment and promotion of black officers, the article examines how senior white officers managed their career journey. Through in-depth interviews with senior officers, the authors develop the notion of ' social network volition ', linking to sociological literatures on race, social networks and elites in work and organizations. The agency of a ' club ', composed of white senior officers, performs social network volition, defined as an invisible guiding hand that identifies, pursues, advises and sponsors white officers who fit the existing leadership composition. The implications of the article underline the need to make explicit the informal supports that reproduce whiteness while upholding the myth of merit.

<snippet>Social media has introduced new parameters that can potentially transform the digital political conversation. Traditionally, in the age of mass communication, public debate was dominated by politicians and journalists. However, digital platforms, primarily Twitter, have allowed other social actors to join the political discussion, trying to influence it. The objective of this research is to establish what factors enable the authority and digital influence of political actors in the public debate on Twitter. We use a big data sample of 127.3 million tweets from the negotiation process around the formation of the Government in Spain. The applied methodology is based on social network analysis and machine learning. The results show that ideology, political initiative, and political career are configured as factors capable of conditioning the authority and influence of political actors in the political conversation on Twitter.

<title>NETWORK IMPACT OF SOCIAL INNOVATION INITIATIVES IN MARGINALISED RURAL COMMUNITIES</title>

<snippet>The marginalised rural communities are characterised by societal challenges, such as isolation, lack of job opportunities, land abandonment, low quality of life and generally low education. Social Innovation (SI) initiatives may represent an opportunity to strengthen relationships among the members of rural community, by means of the alteration of the existing social networks. In this way, more exchange of information is expected, paving the way for the creation of professional collaborations among firms and other actors. This paper aims at proposing a short-term evaluation framework of effectiveness of a SI initiative in terms of reconfiguration of the social network structure. The described empirical case study is VaZapp', a rural hub located in Southern Italy, which provides innovative solutions to activate social relations amongst farmers, altering hence their network. A well-referenced SI theoretical model, developed within the H2020 project SIMRA (Social Innovation in Marginalised Rural Areas), and the methodology of Social Network Analysis (SNA) were used to verify and measure quantitative and qualitative indicators affected by network intervention activated by VaZapp' initiative. Results show that this SI initiative worked effectively, leading to a +308&#37; in the number of relations and +250&#37; in social network density. In addition, an evident improvement in the quality of the social relations was found, especially in cases where there are direct engagements within VaZapp'. Outcomes suggest that supporting and promoting SI initiatives could become a central discussion point for the rethinking of rural development policies focused on regeneration of social relations' structure.

<title>A model and simulation of the emotional contagion of netizens in the process of rumor refutation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-50770-4</url>
<snippet>The emotional contagion of netizens is an important factor that accelerates the spread of rumors, and it is also key to the effectiveness of rumor refutation. Based on the existing emotional model, we improved the method for calculating the emotional value and the transformation rules to simulate how the infection transforms individual emotion to group emotion during rumor refutation. The results show that the cycle and trend of netizen emotional change vary by period, but the final distribution structure presents a relatively stable state. The factors that affect the emotional changes of netizens are mainly objective and subjective aspects, both of which can promote the evolution of emotional contagion. The objective aspect depends on the speed and credibility of the rumor, and the subjective aspect depends on the degree of intimacy between netizens. After rumor refutation, emotions generally change from negative emotions to positive or immune emotions.

<title>Evolution of cooperation with asymmetric social interactions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2113468118</url>
<snippet>How cooperation emerges in human societies is both an evolutionary enigma and a practical problem with tangible implications for societal health. Population structure has long been recognized as a catalyst for cooperation because local interactions facilitate reciprocity. Analysis of population structure typically assumes bidirectional social interactions. But human social interactions are often unidirectional-where one individual has the opportunity to contribute altruistically to another, but not conversely-as the result of organizational hierarchies, social stratification, popularity effects, and endogenous mechanisms of network growth. Here we expand the theory of cooperation in structured populations to account for both uni- and bidirectional social interactions. Even though unidirectional interactions remove the opportunity for reciprocity, we find that cooperation can nonetheless be favored in directed social networks and that cooperation is provably maximized for networks with an intermediate proportion of unidirectional interactions, as observed in many empirical settings. We also identify two simple structural motifs that allow efficient modification of interaction directions to promote cooperation by orders of magnitude. We discuss how our results relate to the concepts of generalized and indirect reciprocity.

<title>Socio-demographic determinants of motorcycle speeding in Maha Sarakham, Thailand</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243930</url>
<snippet>Thailand has the highest road traffic fatality rate in Southeast Asia, making road safety a critical public health concern. A 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) Report showed that speeding behavior was the most important determinant for road traffic crashes in Thailand. Here, we aimed to examine associations of socio-demographic factors (gender, age, socioeconomic status) with self-reported motorcycle speeding behavior. Additionally, we examined a potential role of time discounting and risk preference as mediators in the association of socio-demographic factors with speeding. We used data obtained from the Mahasarakham University Social Network Survey 2018 (MSUSSS) (N = 150). We ran linear network autocorrelation models (lnam) to account for the data's social network structure. We found that males are more likely than females to engage in speeding behavior (beta = 0.140, p = 0.001) and to discount the future (beta = 5.175, p = 0.017). However, further causal mediation analysis showed that time discounting does not mediate the gender-speeding association (p for mediation = 0.540). Although socioeconomic status (subjective social class) was not associated with speeding (beta = 0.039, p = 0.177), age was marginally associated with speeding (beta = 0.005, p = 0.093). Future studies may consider using a larger sample.

<title>Behavioral and environmental contributions to drosophilid social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1920642117</url>
<snippet>Animals interact with each other in species-specific reproducible patterns. These patterns of organization are captured by social network analysis, and social interaction networks (SINs) have been described for a wide variety of species including fish, insects, birds, and mammals. The aim of this study is to understand the evolution of social organization in Drosophila. Using a comparative ecological, phylogenetic, and behavioral approach, the different properties of SINs formed by 20 drosophilids were compared. We investigate whether drosophilid network structures arise from common ancestry, a response to the species' past climate, other social behaviors, or a combination of these factors. This study shows that differences in past climate predicted the species' current SIN properties. The drosophilid phylogeny offered no value to predicting species' differences in SINs through phylogenetic signal tests. This suggests that group-level social behaviors in drosophilid species are shaped by divergent climates. However, we find that the social distance at which flies interact correlated with the drosophilid phylogeny, indicating that behavioral elements of SINs have remained largely unchanged in their evolutionary history. We find a significant correlation of leg length to social distance, outlining the interdependence of anatomy and complex social structures. Although SINs display a complex evolutionary relationship across drosophilids, this study suggests that the ecology, and not common ancestry, contributes to diversity in social structure in Drosophila.

<title>Gender, rank, and social networks on an enterprise social media platform</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2020.02.007</url>
<snippet>In this paper, we harness server-side data-540,000 messages generated by 2085 users on TamTamy, an Enterprise Social Media (ESM) platform-to examine how gender and rank shaped "homophily" (the tendency to connect with similar others) and centrality in an ESM network. Drawing on the logic of "distinctiveness theory," which argues that the numeric rarity of a category in a given setting promotes the use of that category as a basis for connecting with others, we hypothesized and found: (a) the tendency to connect with same-gender others was stronger among women than among men; (b) the tendency to connect with same-rank others was stronger among high-ranking employees than among low-ranking employees;
