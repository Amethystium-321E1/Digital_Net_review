AB Recently, increase of "Freeter" becomes a social issue and studies on "Freeter" problems or Transition from school to work point out that female youths or young people whose academic background and the home background are relatively lower, so are placed in a socially disadvantageous situation becomes a "Freeter" easily. However, there are not so many studies examining factors that influence "Freeter" selection of young people.
   In this article, from the viewpoint of the relation between the "Freeter" selection and a "social network" paid attention to in recent years, I will examine whether the limited social network influences the "Freeter" selection through the questionnaire survey intended for the third grade of high-school. According to the result of this survey, network structures of students are differentiated into the "stable--white-collar" networks and "instable--blue-collar" ones, and relatively fewer students built into the former network select "Freeter", and oppositely more Freeter selection occurred among the students built into "Instable and blue-collar" networks. It is quantitatively suggested that the existence of a social network into which the high school students are built greatly influenced the young people's course achievement.

AB Network models are widely used to represent relations between interacting units or actors. Network data often exhibit transitivity, meaning that two actors that have ties to a third actor are more likely to be tied than actors that do not, homophily by attributes of the actors or dyads, and clustering. Interest often focuses on finding clusters of actors or ties, and the number of groups in the data is typically unknown. We propose a new model, the latent position cluster model, under which the probability of a tie between two actors depends on the distance between them in an unobserved Euclidean 'social space', and the actors' locations in the latent social space arise from a mixture of distributions, each corresponding to a cluster. We propose two estimation methods: a two-stage maximum likelihood method and a fully Bayesian method that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The former is quicker and simpler, but the latter performs better. We also propose a Bayesian way of determining the number of clusters that are present by using approximate conditional Bayes factors. Our model represents transitivity, homophily by attributes and clustering simultaneously and does not require the number of clusters to be known. The model makes it easy to simulate realistic networks with clustering, which are potentially useful as inputs to models of more complex systems of which the network is part, such as epidemic models of infectious disease. We apply the model to two networks of social relations. A free software package in the R statistical language, latentnet, is available to analyse data by using the model.

TI A comparison of various approaches to the exponential random graph
   model: A reanalysis of 102 student networks in school classes
SO SOCIAL NETWORKS

DT Article
DE social networks; ERGM; dependence structure
AB This paper describes an empirical comparison of four specifications of the exponential family of random graph models (ERGM), distinguished by model specification (dyadic independence, Markov, partial conditional dependence) and, for the Markov model, by estimation method (Maximum Pseudolikelihood, Maximum Likelihood). This was done by reanalyzing 102 student networks in 57 junior high school classes. At the level of all classes combined, earlier substantive conclusions were supported by all specifications. However, the different specifications led to different conclusions for individual classes. PL produced unreliable estimates (when ML is regarded as the standard) and had more convergence problems than ML. Furthermore, the estimates of covariate effects were affected considerably by controlling for network structure, although the precise specification of the structural part (Markov or partial conditional dependence) mattered less.

AB The question of what structures of relations between actors emerge in the evolution of social networks is of fundamental sociological interest. The present research proposes that processes of network evolution can be usefully conceptualized in terms of a network of networks, or "metanetwork," wherein networks that are one link manipulation away from one another are connected. Moreover, the geography of metanetworks has real effects on the course of network evolution. Specifically, both equilibrium and non-equilibrium networks located in more desirable regions of the metanetwork are found to be more probable. These effects of metanetwork geography are illustrated by two dynamic network models: one in which actors pursue access to unique information through "structural holes," and the other in which actors pursue access to valid information by minimizing path length. Finally, I discuss future directions for modeling network dynamics in terms of metanetworks.

AB Recent advances in statistical network analysis based on the family of exponential random graph (ERG) models have greatly improved our ability to conduct inference on dependence in large social networks [Snijders, T.A.B., 2002. Markov Chain Monte Carlo Estimation of Exponential Random Graph Models. Journal of Social Structure 3, 2; Pattison, RE., Robins, G.L., 2002. Neighbourhood-based models for social networks.

Statistical Modeling of Social Networks: Practical Advances and Results. Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology, University of Washington, Working Paper No. 05-01, previous papers this issue]. This paper applies advances in both model parameterizations and computational algorithms to an examination of the structure observed in an adolescent friendship network of 1681 actors from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (AddHealth). ERG models of social network structure are fit using the R package statnet, and their adequacy assessed through comparison of model predictions with the observed data for higher-order network statistics.
   For this friendship network, the commonly used model of Markov dependence leads to the problems of degeneracy discussed by Handcock [Handcock, M.S., 2002. Statistical models for social networks: degeneracy and inference. In: Breiger, R., Carley, K., Pattison, R (Eds.), Dynamic Social Network Modeling and Analysis. National Academic Press, Washington, DC, pp. 229-240; Handcock, M.S., 2003. Assessing Degeneracy in Statistical Models of Social Networks. Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences, University of Washington, Working Paper No. 39]. On the other hand, model parameterizations introduced by Snijders et al. [Snijders, T.A.B., Pattison, R, Robins, G.L., Handcock, M., in press. New specifications for exponential random graph models. Sociological Methodology] and Hunter and Handcock [Hunter, D.R., Handcock, M.S., in press. Inference in curved exponential family models for networks. Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics] avoid degeneracy and provide reasonable fit to the data. Degree-only models did a poor job of capturing observed network structure; those that did best included terms both for heterogeneous mixing on exogenous attributes (grade and self-reported race) as well as endogenous clustering. Networks simulated from this model were largely consistent with the observed network on multiple higher-order network statistics, including the number of triangles, the size of the largest component, the overall reachability, the distribution of geodesic distances, the degree distribution, and the shared partner distribution. The ability to fit such models to large datasets and to make inference,about the underling processes generating the network represents a major advance in the field of statistical network analysis.
