AB Individuals are more likely to interact with people who are similar in terms of socio-demographics and values than dissimilar people, which is often explained by a focus on selection effects. Yet, tie loss of dissimilar ties might also cause network homogeneity. Unfortunately, within the literature, there is a relative dearth of knowledge on the relationship between (dis)similarity and tie loss. Hence, we address this gap by theorizing and testing the relation between (dis)similarity and tie loss in the core discussion network (CDN) of Dutch citizens, also considering how ties are embedded in the CDN.

TI Low credibility URL sharing on Twitter during reporting linking rare
   blood clots with the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID NEWS
AB The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by an "infodemic" of misinformation. Misleading narratives around the virus, its origin, and treatments have had serious implications for public health. In March 2021, concerns were raised about links between the Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZ) COVID-19 vaccine and recipients developing blood clots. This paper aims to identify whether this prompted any reaction in the diffusion of low-credibility COVID-19-relate information on Twitter. Twitter's application programming interface was used to collect data containing COVID-19-related keywords between 4th and 25th March 2021, a period centred on the peak of new coverage linking rare blood clots with the AZ vaccine. We analysed and visualised the data using temporal analysis and social network analysis tools. We subsequently analysed the data to determine the most influential users and domains in the propagation of low-credibility information about COVID-19 and the AZ vaccine. This research presents evidence that the peak of news coverage linking rare blood clots with the AZ vaccine correlated with an increased volume and proportion of low-credibility AZ-related content propagated on Twitter. However, no equivalent changes to the volume, propagation, or network structure for the full dataset of COVID-19-related information or misinformation were observed. The research identified RT.com as the most prolific creator of low-credibility COVID-19-related content. It also highlighted the crucial role of self-promotion in the successful propagation of low-credibility content on Twitter. The findings suggest that the simple approach adopted within the research to identify the most popular and influential sources of low-credibility content presents a valuable opportunity for public health authorities and social media platforms to develop bespoke strategies to counter the propagation of misinformation in the aftermath of a breaking news event.

   Compromise (BEC) Scammers: Insights from the "Black Axe" Confraternity

ID ORGANIZED-CRIME; SOCIAL NETWORK; FRAUD
AB I explored the relationship between the "Black Axe" Confraternity and cybercrime, with a particular emphasis on the structural dynamics of the Business Email Compromise (BEC) schemes. I investigated whether a conventional hierarchical system governs the membership and remuneration for BEC roles as perpetrators by interviewing an accused "leader" of the "Black Axe" affiliated cybercriminal incarcerated in a prominent Western nation. I supplemented the analysis of interview data with insights from tapped phone records monitored by a law enforcement entity. I merged Actor-network theory and Social Network theory as analytical frameworks and thematically analyzed data to produce six overarching themes: (1) The fluidity of Structure and Adaptive Roles in BEC, (2) Challenges in Visualizing Criminal Networks, (3) Globalization and Transnational Dimensions, (4) Social and Cultural Influences, (5) Internal Cybersecurity Threats and Money Laundering, and (6) Remuneration and Influences of Cryptocurrency, casting a brighter light on the topic. Unlike traditional organized crime, BEC scammers have adopted a nonhierarchical model that is flexible and fluid. I found no evidence of a rigid hierarchy dictating positions and remuneration for BEC roles. Instead, I observed that cybercriminals involved in BEC activities functioned horizontally, promoting fluidity, maneuverability, collaboration, and specialization across various facets of their illicit pursuits. I also highlighted the cross-border links BEC offenders have with other criminal actors facilitated by Black Axe organizational machinery. My research adds value to the existing body of knowledge, utilizing a unique dataset comprising direct testimonies of a high-profile BEC offender affiliated with the 'hard-to-access,' Black Axe gang.

AB Dunbar's number is the cognitive limit of human beings to maintain stable relationships with other individuals in their social networks, and it is found to be 150. It is based on the neocortex size of humans. Usually, Dunbar's number and related phenomena are studied from the perspective of an individual. Dunbar's number also plays a crucial role in evolutionary psychology and allied areas. However, no study done so far has considered a couple who are in a stable relationship as a system from the perspective of Dunbar's number and its hierarchy layers. In this paper, we study the impact of Dunbar's number and Dunbar's hierarchy from the perspective of a couple by studying mathematically the conjoint Dunbar graphs for a couple. The cost of romance is the loss of almost two people from one's support network when a human being enters into a new relationship. Thus, we obtain mathematically that there is no significant change in one's friendship if human beings spend negligible time with their partners. Also, along with marriage and friendship development, we attempt to assess how a person's social network structure holds up over the course of a romantic relationship. The stability of personal social networks is discussed through soft set theory and balance theoretic approach.

AB To enhance the international division of labor of developing countries and scientifically respond to the risks and conflicts in the network system, it is important to examine the evolutionary characteristics of the global value-added trade network, simulate the impact of risk shocks, and propose corresponding measures. Based on UNCTAD-Eora value-added trade data, this paper measured and evaluated the evolution characteristics of the global value-added trade network from 2003 to 2018 using the social network analysis and value-added decomposition methods. Then we analyze the impact of risk shocks on the evolution of the trade network using the bootstrap percolation model, building global trade networks and proposing countermeasures. The results show that the global value-added trade network has formed a complex structure and structurally stable distribution pattern, with Germany, China, and the U.S. as the core and the most crucial supports. Among which, China's core position is mainly due to the rapid rise in its export center status. The trade benefits of the three core countries are both competitive and complementary along the "One Belt and One Road". Furthermore, simulations of bootstrap percolation model reveals that the adoption of trade protection policies (caused by poor institutional quality) by different countries will spread and diffuse non-linearly in the network, and the impacts triggered by low-centered countries are comparatively more widespread. By improving defense capabilities and changing the network structure, the "cascading" impacts of trade policy uncertainty can be reduced.
