AB The increasing popularity and widespread use of the Internet has made it an emerging venue for delivering health-related messages and interventions. The current study explored the potential for using social networking sites (SNS), specifically MySpace, to connect youth to sexual health services. Surveys and focus groups with youth aged 14-19 living in low-income communities in California revealed high levels of overall Internet access, frequent use of SNS, and experience in searching for health information online. However, disparities in frequency and location of Internet access by race/ethnicity, and hesitancy among some youth to join a clinic's online social network, may affect the success of this new strategy in some populations. Interviews with clinic staff highlighted the successes and challenges of using MySpace as part of their outreach efforts. Staff described balancing the benefits of web-based outreach, including its low cost, wide reach, and teen friendliness, with its challenges, including overcoming technological barriers, ensuring teens' safety from inappropriate contact, and remaining timely and relevant given the dynamic nature of the Internet. This study indicates that SNS and other technologies have strong potential for reaching diverse youth with critical health information when implemented as part of a comprehensive outreach strategy.

AB This paper explores the values, characteristics, and conditions of interoperability provided by Open Application Programming Interfaces (Open APIs) used by Facebook to identify underlying tensions that may challenge the sustainability of the Web as an open, secure, and liberating communication space. Interoperability between major online social network services holds great potential for linking a broad range of platforms, spaces, and people together in exciting new ways. Open APIs support interoperability by providing the tools to share data used to develop popular and useful Web applications, achieve seamless integration of social media services, and give rise to mutually beneficial third-party developer ecosystems that build on top of social media platforms. Yet, while Open APIs provide new ways of sharing and participating, they also provide a means for companies like Facebook to achieve market dominance, as well as undermine privacy, data security, contextual integrity, user autonomy and freedom. This paper examines interoperability enabled by Open APIs among competing online services ( Facebook, Google, YouTube, MySpace and Twitter) to identify the tenuous push and pull of competition and cooperation. The author provides a summary and analysis of Facebook's Open API releases over the last five years, to determine the underlying conditions for sharing and identify the social implications of their technical features. This paper concludes by suggesting ways that users can make more informed decisions about their sharing and perhaps change the underlying conditions of interoperability all together by developing more secure and user controllable social networks, Open APIs, and online applications.

AB We investigated the effect of tolerance of reputation-making norms on cooperation by conducting an evolutionary simulation with more realistic constraints than those in previous studies. Specifically, agents could make social exchanges only within their neighborhoods on the network, and could refer to the reputation of others only within two steps on the network when exchanging and rewiring. Under these constraints, we compared the effect of three reputation-making norms which varied across the levels of tolerance: i.e., image scoring, standing, and strict discriminator. The results were as follows. Under the standing norm, while social exchanges increased in number because the network became dense, cooperation was highly likely to collapse because defection tended to be more adaptive than cooperation. On the other hand, under the strict discriminator norm, while cooperation was stable, the social exchanges decreased in number because the network became sparse. These results indicate that the tolerances of reputation-making norms would affect not only the robustness of cooperation but also the structure of the social network. This implies that the intolerant reputation-making norm focusing only on level of cooperation may have negative effects on social capital by shrinking the social network as a by-product. In the second simulation, we added perceptual errors that caused agents to misinterpret another's reputation. The results showed that the cooperation was stable even under tolerant standing norm. This implies that when social exchanges are done under the constraints of the network structure and perceptual errors, even the tolerant reputation-making norm can maintain cooperation.

AB Statistical models for social networks as dependent variables must represent the typical network dependencies between tie variables such as reciprocity, homophily, transitivity, etc. This review first treats models for single (cross-sectionally observed) networks and then for network dynamics. For single networks, the older literature concentrated on conditionally uniform models.. Various types of latent space models have been developed: for discrete, general metric, ultrametric, Euclidean, and partially ordered spaces. Exponential random graph models were proposed long ago but now are applied more and more thanks to the non-Markovian social circuit specifications that were recently proposed. Modeling network dynamics is less complicated than modeling single network observations because dependencies are spread out in time. For modeling network dynamics, continuous-time models are more fruitful. Actor-oriented models here provide a model that can represent many dependencies in a flexible way. Strong model development is now going on to combine the features of these models and to extend them to more complicated outcome spaces.

AB Social insects exhibit coordinated behaviour without central control. Local interactions among individuals determine their behaviour and regulate the activity of the colony. Harvester ants are recruited for outside work, using networks of brief antennal contacts, in the nest chamber closest to the nest exit: the entrance chamber. Here, we combine empirical observations, image analysis and computer simulations to investigate the structure and function of the interaction network in the entrance chamber. Ant interactions were distributed heterogeneously in the chamber, with an interaction hot-spot at the entrance leading further into the nest. The distribution of the total interactions per ant followed a right-skewed distribution, indicating the presence of highly connected individuals. Numbers of ant encounters observed positively correlated with the duration of observation. Individuals varied in interaction frequency, even after accounting for the duration of observation. An ant's interaction frequency was explained by its path shape and location within the entrance chamber. Computer simulations demonstrate that variation among individuals in connectivity accelerates information flow to an extent equivalent to an increase in the total number of interactions. Individual variation in connectivity, arising from variation among ants in location and spatial behaviour, creates interaction centres, which may expedite information flow.
