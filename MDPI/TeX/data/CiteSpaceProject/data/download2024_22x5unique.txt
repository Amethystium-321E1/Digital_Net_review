AB It is well established that a person's productivity is strongly related to interactions among their network cycles. Despite this, much of the literature concerning farmers' productivity describes only their formal relationships with extension officials, ignoring their personal relationships. This study was motivated by the need to understand how farmers can use their social networks to promote information diffusion and learning among themselves. The study assessed whether farmers' information networks can positively influence their productivity and performance through the study of their network structure. We used survey data from 200 Ghanaian farmers. The data was then analyzed using descriptive statistics and an exponential random graph model (ERGM). The results of this study showed that farmers' information networks had a positive effect on their performance and productivity. The study also revealed that farmers seek information from key and influential farmers while key farmers also seek information from other key farmers. A further finding of the study showed that many factors contributed to the successful diffusion of information, such as popularity, activity spread, reciprocity, multiple connections, and homophily of experience. However, on the other hand, transitivity was not significant in this network. Hence, this study clarifies the effect of the structural characteristics of farmers' information network which influence information diffusion for higher performance and productivity. This study argues that agricultural managers should take measures to ensure that farmers understand how their information network can benefit their peers, as well as their own performance and productivity.

ID ORGANIZED-CRIME
AB The interplay between (criminal) organizations and (law enforcement) disruption strategies is critical in criminology and social network analysis. Like legitimate businesses, criminal enterprises thrive by fulfilling specific demands and navigating their unique challenges, including balancing operational visibility and security. This study aims at comprehending criminal networks' internal dynamics, resilience to law enforcement interventions, and robustness to changes in external conditions. Using a model based on evolutionary game theory, we analyze these networks as collaborative assemblies of roles, considering expected costs, potential benefits, and the certainty of expected outcomes. Here, we show that criminal organizations exhibit strong hysteresis effects, with increased resilience and robustness once established, challenging the effectiveness of traditional law enforcement strategies focused on deterrence through increased punishment. The hysteresis effect defines optimal thresholds for the formation or dissolution of criminal organisation. Our findings indicate that interventions of similar magnitude can lead to vastly different outcomes depending on the existing state of criminality. This result suggests that the relationship between stricter punishment and its deterrent effect on organized crime is complex and sometimes non-linear. Furthermore, we demonstrate that network structure, specifically interconnectedness (link density) and assortativity of specialized skills, significantly influences the formation and stability of criminal organizations, underscoring the importance of considering social connections and the accessibility of roles in combating organized crime. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the systemic nature of criminal behavior from an evolutionary perspective and highlight the need for adaptive, strategic approaches in policy-making and law enforcement to disrupt criminal networks effectively.

AB Disinformation-false information intended to cause harm or for profit-is pervasive. While disinformation exists in several domains, one area with great potential for personal harm from disinformation is healthcare. The amount of disinformation about health issues on social media has grown dramatically over the past several years, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study described in this paper sought to determine the characteristics of multimedia social network posts that lead them to believe and potentially act on healthcare disinformation. The study was conducted in a neuroscience laboratory in early 2022. Twenty-six study participants each viewed a series of 20 either honest or dishonest social media posts, dealing with various aspects of healthcare. They were asked to determine if the posts were true or false and then to provide the reasoning behind their choices. Participant gaze was captured through eye tracking technology and investigated through "area of interest" analysis. This approach has the potential to discover the elements of disinformation that help convince the viewer a given post is true. Participants detected the true nature of the posts they were exposed to 69% of the time. Overall, the source of the post, whether its claims seemed reasonable, and the look and feel of the post were the most important reasons they cited for determining whether it was true or false. Based on the eye tracking data collected, the factors most associated with successfully detecting disinformation were the total number of fixations on key words and the total number of revisits to source information. The findings suggest the outlines of generalizations about why people believe online disinformation, suggesting a basis for the development of mid-range theory.

AB Information about the vaccine is usually spread through heterogeneous networks in reality, where public opinion bursts out faster than in homogeneous networks. Considering the complexity of heterogeneous networks, we develop a network susceptible-forwarding-immune (NET-SFI) model to describe the patterns of information propagation in the actual social network. Classifying the states of nodes according to the number of users can contact in the social network, the NET-SFI model focuses on the network structure and user heterogeneity. We adopt a data-model drive method to conduct the model validation including two types of COVID-19 vaccine information from the Chinese Sina Microblog. Our parameter sensitivity analyses show the important significance of node degree in causing the outbreak of public opinion. Moreover, corresponding conclusions based on our analytic study are conducive to designing valid strategies for vaccine information dissemination.

TI Values and economic performance across European welfare state regimes:
   Direct and indirect effects through social capital, human capital and
   managerial skills
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

AB The values that people hold are linked to their economic performance. These links can be either direct or indirect, operating through moderating variables such as social network participation, interpersonal trust, trust in institutions, human capital, managerial skills and hours worked. In this paper these effects are studied using structural equation modelling (SEM) methodology applied to European Social Survey data from 28 European countries in 2018. Schwartz classification of values is used, distinguishing between Self-Enhancement (Power, Achievement), Openness to Change (Self-Direction), Conservation (Tradition, Security, Conformity) and Self-Transcendence (Universalism, Benevolence) values. It is found that Power has the strongest positive direct effect on economic performance, further strengthened by a positive indirect structural effect through hours worked. Self-Direction is indirectly positively linked to economic performance through higher managerial skills and hours worked. Tradition has a strong negative direct effect on economic performance. Security is indirectly negatively linked with economic performance, owing to its negative effects on interpersonal trust, management skills and hours worked. Some of the identified effects are context-dependent and vary across European welfare state regimes. For example, Power is statistically significantly linked to economic performance only in the liberal and conservative regime. Values promoted by respective welfare state regimes are not necessarily associated with higher incomes within those regimes, e.g., Tradition and Security values promoted in the conservative and Mediterranean regime are associated with lower incomes. These findings may lead to a range of policy implications, particularly in relation to the policies on immigration, demographics, the labor market, and work-life balance. Unfortunately, due to the cross-sectional character of the dataset, causal relations among the variables of interest could not be identified.
