AB Social networks are fundamental to the broad scale cooperation observed in human populations. But by structuring the flow of benefits from cooperation, networks also create and sustain macro-level inequalities. Here we ask how two aspects of inequality shape the evolution of cooperation in dynamic social networks. Results from a crowdsourced experiment (N = 1080) show that inequality alters the distribution of cooperation within networks such that participants engage in more costly cooperation with their wealthier partners in order to maintain more valuable connections to them. Inequality also influences network dynamics, increasing the tendency for participants to seek wealthier partners, resulting in structural network change. These processes aggregate to alter network structures and produce greater system-level inequality. The findings thus shed critical light on how networks serve as both boon and barrier to macro-level human flourishing.

AB The impact of social media use on youth subcultures, such as graffiti writers, has been rapid and dramatic, bringing with it a number of significant transformations that present both opportunities and challenges. This paper explores the impact of the Internet and social media on a community of graffiti practitioners. I argue that the rise and uptake of online social networking platforms such as Instagram and You Tube have offered a range of affordances to the practice of graffiti writing. These affordances include: greater accessibility to graffiti culture; learning opportunities; and opportunities for wider distribution and curation of graffiti pieces. Simultaneously, social media challenges the significance of 'community', that is, the physical social interaction afforded by participation in real world graffiti crews. The findings suggest that while there are tangible benefits from the use of the Internet and uptake of social media by the graffiti writing community, it is the physical communal bonds experienced within a graffiti crew that are vital to the wellbeing and continuity of the culture. This paper contributes to our understanding of how social media affects youth more broadly and specifically how social media platforms are transforming the experience of youth subcultural practice.

AB GitHub has become the central online platform for much of open source, hosting most open source code repositories. With this popularity, the public digital traces of GitHub are now a valuable means to study teamwork and collaboration. In many ways, however, GitHub is a convenience sample, and may not be representative of open source development off the platform. Here we develop a novel, extensive sample of public open source project repositories outside of centralized platforms. We characterized these projects along a number of dimensions, and compare to a time-matched sample of corresponding GitHub projects. Our sample projects tend to have more collaborators, are maintained for longer periods, and tend to be more focused on academic and scientific problems.

TI Contrasting social and non-social sources of predictability in human

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS

AB Social structures influence human behavior, including their movement patterns. Indeed, latent information about an individual's movement can be present in the mobility patterns of both acquaintances and strangers. We develop a "colocation" network to distinguish the mobility patterns of an ego's social ties from those not socially connected to the ego but who arrive at a location at a similar time as the ego. Using entropic measures, we analyze and bound the predictive information of an individual's mobility pattern and its flow to both types of ties. While the former generically provide more information, replacing up to 94% of an ego's predictability, significant information is also present in the aggregation of unknown colocators, that contain up to 85% of an ego's predictive information. Such information flow raises privacy concerns: individuals sharing data via mobile applications may be providing actionable information on themselves as well as others whose data are absent.
   Information about an individual's mobility can leave traces embedded in the social network. The authors show that such traces are also present beyond the social network. Simple colocation contains predictive information about one's mobility patterns even when the colocators have no social links. In the aggregate, non-social information can sometimes meet or exceed social information.

AB Personal social networks profoundly influence a wide range of outcomes throughout the life course. But little research has considered how some features of individuals' social networks may be shaped by experiences in early life. This study uses nationally representative data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project to examine how childhood circumstances may shape the structure of older adults' personal social networks. The analyses show that higher childhood socioeconomic status is associated with larger network size and a more expansive, less kin-based network structure. At the same time, higher levels of family happiness in childhood are associated with greater network density and more kin-centric network composition, which may reflect greater access to social support and overall network intimacy across the life course. The results suggest that studies of the relative advantages of social network structure may benefit from contextualizing individuals' social networks in terms of their social origins. The article discusses the need for additional research on the life-course bases of the link between childhood circumstances and later-life network properties, and what role this connection plays in shaping later-life well-being.
