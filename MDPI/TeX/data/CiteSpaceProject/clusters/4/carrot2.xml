<title>Misery Implicitly Loves Company: Implicit Homophily and Bully Victimization</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440211038360</url>
<snippet>This study focuses on the formation of bullied individuals' friendships and romantic relationships. Individuals bullied in their past may be more likely to form connections with those who share similar oppressive experiences. Thus, we investigated the possibility that implicit homophily underlies the formation of interpersonal relationships among previously bullied individuals. Moreover, we investigated whether these individuals were aware of their friends' and romantic partners' similarly oppressive experiences prior to initiating the relationship. Our findings suggest that the young adults in our sample bullied in grade school are significantly more likely to have a close friend and or significant other who also experienced bullying. The findings of this study contribute to the relatively small, yet growing, body of research on implicit homophily, add to research extending homophily processes to bullies and victims, and are in line with research suggesting that deselection (a form of induced homophily) can coexist with homophily by personal preference.

<title>Emergence of segregation in evolving social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1014486108</url>
<snippet>In many social networks, there is a high correlation between the similarity of actors and the existence of relationships between them. This paper introduces a model of network evolution where actors are assumed to have a small aversion from being connected to others who are dissimilar to themselves, and yet no actor strictly prefers a segregated network. This model is motivated by Schelling's [Schelling TC (1969) Models of segregation. Am Econ Rev 59: 488-493] classic model of residential segregation, and we show that Schelling's results also apply to the structure of networks; namely, segregated networks always emerge regardless of the level of aversion. In addition, we prove analytically that attribute similarity among connected network actors always reaches a stationary distribution, and this distribution is independent of network topology and the level of aversion bias. This research provides a basis for more complex models of social interaction that are driven in part by the underlying attributes of network actors and helps advance our understanding of why dysfunctional social network structures may emerge.

<title>Balancing the strength of external and internal tie for tacit knowledge management</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2020.1714025</url>
<snippet>From external and internal perspective, this research constructs the model regarding tie strength and tacit knowledge management based on social network theory. To test the proposed model, this study disposes and analyses the data captured from 301 emerging firms located in Chinese large cities. The results confirm the proposition that both external and internal tie strength impose a positive effect on the process of tacit knowledge management. In addition, temperate internal tie strength positively affects the relationship between external tie strength and tacit knowledge acquisition, while excessive internal tie strength negatively moderates this relationship. This study not only expands the theoretical space in the field of social networks and knowledge management, but also provides guidance for the enterprise's relationship network management and innovation practice.

<title>The Problem of Scaling in Exponential Random Graph Models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0049124120986178</url>
<snippet>This study shows that residual variation can cause problems related to scaling in exponential random graph models (ERGM). Residual variation is likely to exist when there are unmeasured variables in a model-even those uncorrelated with other predictors-or when the logistic form of the model is inappropriate. As a consequence, coefficients cannot be interpreted as effect sizes or compared between models and homophily coefficients, as well as other interaction coefficients, cannot be interpreted as substantive effects in most ERGM applications. We conduct a series of simulations considering the substantive impact of these issues, revealing that realistic levels of residual variation can have large consequences for ERGM inference. A flexible methodological framework is introduced to overcome these problems. Formal tests of mediation and moderation are also proposed. These methods are applied to revisit the relationship between selective mixing and triadic closure in a large AddHealth school friendship network. Extensions to other classes of statistical work models are discussed.

<title>Co-evolution of a socio-cognitive scientific network: A case study of citation dynamics among astronomers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.11.008</url>
<snippet>This paper aims to understand how a group of academics cite each others' work through time, considering the simultaneous co-evolution of three networks representing their scientific collaboration, the journals in which they publish and institutional membership. It argues that both social and cognitive processes contribute to these dynamics. Two types of network mechanisms are considered specifically: closures by affiliation and closures by association. To assess whether these mechanisms generate the macro features of the network under study, we propose new features for three-mode multilevel networks such as the mixed geodesic distances, mixed degree distributions, and the mixed quadrilateral census. We investigate whether a micro-level model that considers the above-mentioned network mechanisms is able to correctly reproduce these features. We apply stochastic actororiented models (SAOMs) for one-mode and two-mode networks to link the micro-macro processes using a dataset of a scientific community of astronomers from 2013 to 2015. The results suggest that social relationships grounded on scientific collaboration and proximity based on institutional affiliation are more accurately suited to understanding the co-evolution of the network of citations than an alternative approach that merely considers cognitive-based networks measured as the similarity in publishing in the same journals.

<title>EVOLVING FRIENDSHIP NETWORKS - AN INDIVIDUAL-ORIENTED APPROACH IMPLEMENTING SIMILARITY</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-8733(94)00246-7</url>
<snippet>This article is an extension to Zeggelink (1994) which introduced the individual-oriented approach to model the evolution of networks. In this approach, the dynamics of friendship network structure are considered as a result of individual choices with regard to friendship relationships. Individuals have specific characteristics and behavioral rules. The previous model was based solely on individuals' different needs for social contact. In the model presented here, we introduce another important determinant of friendship formation: preferences for similar friends. The amount of heterogeneity of the distribution of individual characteristics on which this similarity is based thus becomes important. In contrast to most existing dynamic social network models, this aspect of heterogeneity, as well as dependence of dyads, can easily be dealt with. We examine how individual characteristics and preferences (individual attributes at the micro level) with respect to prospective friendship relations interact and aggregate to outcomes at the macro level: the network structure.

<title>Micro-Macro Mediation Analysis in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00811750231220950</url>
<snippet>Mediation analysis is increasingly used in the social sciences. Extension to social network data, however, has proved difficult because statistical network models are formulated at a lower level of analysis (the dyad) than many outcomes of interest. This study introduces a general approach for micro-macro mediation analysis in social networks. The author defines the average mediated micro effect (AMME) as the indirect effect of a network selection process on an individual, group, or organizational outcome through its effect on an intervening network variable. The author shows that the AMME can be nonparametrically identified using a wide range of common statistical network and regression modeling strategies under the assumption of conditional independence among multiple mediators. Nonparametric and parametric algorithms are introduced to generically estimate the AMME in a multitude of research designs. The author illustrates the utility of the method with an applied example using cross-sectional National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health data to examine the friendship selection mechanisms that indirectly shape adolescent school performance through their effect on network structure.

<title>Geographies of an Online Social Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137248</url>
<snippet>How is online social media activity structured in the geographical space? Recent studies have shown that in spite of earlier visions about the "death of distance", physical proximity is still a major factor in social tie formation and maintenance in virtual social networks. Yet, it is unclear, what are the characteristics of the distance dependence in online social networks. In order to explore this issue the complete network of the former major Hungarian online social network is analyzed. We find that the distance dependence is weaker for the online social network ties than what was found earlier for phone communication networks. For a further analysis we introduced a coarser granularity: We identified the settlements with the nodes of a network and assigned two kinds of weights to the links between them. When the weights are proportional to the number of contacts we observed weakly formed, but spatially based modules resemble to the borders of macro-regions, the highest level of regional administration in the country. If the weights are defined relative to an uncorrelated null model, the next level of administrative regions, counties are reflected.

<title>Alternative estimation methods for identifying contagion effects in dynamic social networks: A latent-space adjusted approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.01.002</url>
<snippet>Contagion effects, also known as peer effects or social influence process, have become more and more central to social science, especially with the availability of longitudinal social network data. However, contagion effects are usually difficult to identify, as they are often entangled with other factors, such as homophily in the selection process, the individual's preference for the same social settings, etc. Methods currently available either do not solve these problems or require strong assumptions. Following Shalizi and Thomas (2011), I frame this difficulty as an omitted variable bias problem, and I propose several alternative estimation methods that have potentials to correctly identify contagion effects when there is an unobserved trait that co-determines the influence and the selection. The Monte-Carlo simulation results suggest that a latent-space adjusted estimator is especially promising. It outperforms other estimators that are traditionally used to deal with the unobserved variables, including a structural equation based estimator and an instrumental variable estimator.

<title>A novel method for assessing and measuring homophily in networks through second-order statistics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12710-7</url>
<snippet>We present a new method for assessing and measuring homophily in networks whose nodes have categorical attributes, namely when the nodes of networks come partitioned into classes (colors). We probe this method in two different classes of networks: (i) protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, where nodes correspond to proteins, partitioned according to their functional role, and edges represent functional interactions between proteins (ii) Pokec on-line social network, where nodes correspond to users, partitioned according to their age, and edges respresent friendship between users.Similarly to other classical and well consolidated approaches, our method compares the relative edge density of the subgraphs induced by each class with the corresponding expected relative edge density under a null model. The novelty of our approach consists in prescribing an endogenous null model, namely, the sample space of the null model is built on the input network itself. This allows us to give exact explicit expression for the z-score of the relative edge density of each class as well as other related statistics. The z-scores directly quantify the statistical significance of the observed homophily via Cebysev inequality. The expression of each z-score is entered by the network structure through basic combinatorial invariant such as the number of subgraphs with two spanning edges. Each z-score is computed in O(n + m) time for a network with n nodes and m edges. This leads to an overall efficient computational method for assesing homophily. We complement the analysis of homophily/heterophily by considering z-scores of the number of isolated nodes in the subgraphs induced by each class, that are computed in O(nm) time. Theoretical results are then exploited to show that, as expected, both the analyzed network classes are significantly homophilic with respect to the considered node properties.

<title>The Strength of Structural Diversity in Online Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.34133/2021/9831621</url>
<snippet>Understanding the way individuals are interconnected in social networks is of prime significance to predict their collective outcomes. Leveraging a large-scale dataset from a knowledge-sharing website, this paper presents an exploratory investigation of the way to depict structural diversity in directed networks and how it can be utilized to predict one's online social reputation. To capture the structural diversity of an individual, we first consider the number of weakly and strongly connected components in one's contact neighborhood and further take the coexposure network of social neighbors into consideration. We show empirical evidence that the structural diversity of an individual is able to provide valuable insights to predict personal online social reputation, and the inclusion of a coexposure network provides an additional ingredient to achieve that goal. After synthetically controlling several possible confounding factors through matching experiments, structural diversity still plays a nonnegligible role in the prediction of personal online social reputation. Our work constitutes one of the first attempts to empirically study structural diversity in directed networks and has practical implications for a range of domains, such as social influence and collective intelligence studies.

<title>Stochastic weighted graphs: Flexible model specification and simulation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2016.11.002</url>
<snippet>In most domains of network analysis researchers consider networks that arise in nature with weighted edges. Such networks are routinely dichotomized in the interest of using available methods for statistical inference with networks. The generalized exponential random graph model (GERGM) is a recently proposed method used to simulate and model the edges of a weighted graph. The GERGM specifies a joint distribution for an exponential family of graphs with continuous-valued edge weights. However, current estimation algorithms for the GERGM only allow inference on a restricted family of model specifications. To address this issue, we develop a Metropolis-Hastings method that can be used to estimate any GERGM specification, thereby significantly extending the family of weighted graphs that can be modeled with the GERGM. We show that new flexible model specifications are capable of avoiding likelihood degeneracy and efficiently capturing network structure in applications where such models were not previously available. We demonstrate the utility of this new class of GERGMs through application to two real network data sets, and we further assess the effectiveness of our proposed methodology by simulating non-degenerate model specifications from the well-studied two-stars model. A working R version of the GERGM code is available in the supplement and is incorporated in the GERGM CRAN package. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>The Role of Skin Color in Latino Social Networks: Color Homophily in Sending and Receiving Societies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2332649220940346</url>
<snippet>How does skin color shape the social networks and integration pathways of phenotypically diverse immigrant groups? Focusing on Dominicans and Puerto Ricans. groups with considerable diversity across the Black-White color line, the authors explore whether migrants to the United States have greater color homophily in their primary social networks than nonmigrants in the sending societies. The authors analyze egocentric network data, including unique skin color measures for both 114 respondents and 1,702 alters. They test hypotheses derived from ethnic unifier theory and color line racialization theory. The data show evidence of color homophily among Dominicans but suggest that these patterns may be imported from the sending society rather than fostered by the U.S. context. Furthermore, the authors find that migrants' skin color is associated with having ties to White or Black Americans but with different patterns for each ethnic group. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for economic mobility and U.S. racial hierarchies.

<title>Homophily, Setbacks, and the Dissolution of Heterogeneous Ties: Evidence from Professional Tennis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.15195/v10.a7</url>
<snippet>Why do people engage with similar others despite ample opportunities to interact with dissimilar others? We argue that adversity or setbacks may have a stronger deteriorative effect on ties made up of dissimilar individuals, prompting people to give up on such ties more easily, which, over the long run, results in people forming ties with similar others. We examine this argument in the context of Association of Tennis Professionals tournaments, using data on 9,669 unique doubles pairs involving 1,812 unique players from 99 countries from 2000 to 2020. We find that doubles pairs with players from different countries are more likely to dissolve after a setback, especially if those countries lack social trust and connections with one another; this reality further contributes to the individual player's increased tendency to collaborate with same-country players in the next tournament. Our study has direct implications for interventions for diversity and inclusion.

<title>Statistical Models for Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102709</url>
<snippet>Statistical models for social networks as dependent variables must represent the typical network dependencies between tie variables such as reciprocity, homophily, transitivity, etc. This review first treats models for single (cross-sectionally observed) networks and then for network dynamics. For single networks, the older literature concentrated on conditionally uniform models.. Various types of latent space models have been developed: for discrete, general metric, ultrametric, Euclidean, and partially ordered spaces. Exponential random graph models were proposed long ago but now are applied more and more thanks to the non-Markovian social circuit specifications that were recently proposed. Modeling network dynamics is less complicated than modeling single network observations because dependencies are spread out in time. For modeling network dynamics, continuous-time models are more fruitful. Actor-oriented models here provide a model that can represent many dependencies in a flexible way. Strong model development is now going on to combine the features of these models and to extend them to more complicated outcome spaces.

<title>Similarity and differences in age, gender, ethnicity, and education as explanatory factors of tie loss in the core discussion network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.09.003</url>
<snippet>Individuals are more likely to interact with people who are similar in terms of socio-demographics and values than dissimilar people, which is often explained by a focus on selection effects. Yet, tie loss of dissimilar ties might also cause network homogeneity. Unfortunately, within the literature, there is a relative dearth of knowledge on the relationship between (dis)similarity and tie loss. Hence, we address this gap by theorizing and testing the relation between (dis)similarity and tie loss in the core discussion network (CDN) of Dutch citizens, also considering how ties are embedded in the CDN.

<title>Short-term and long-term effects of a social network intervention on friendships among university students</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59594-z</url>
<snippet>Informal social relations, such as friendships, are crucial for the well-being and success of students at all levels of education. Network interventions can aim at providing contact opportunities in school settings to prevent the social isolation of individuals and facilitate integration between otherwise segregated social groups. We investigate the short-term and long-term effects of one specific network intervention in an undergraduate cohort freshly admitted to an engineering department (N=226). In this intervention, we randomly assigned students into small groups at an introduction event two months prior to their first day at university. The groups were designed to increase mixed-gender contact opportunities. Two months after the intervention, we find a higher rate of friendships, common friends, and mixed-gender friendships in pairs of students who were assigned to the same group than in pairs from different groups (short-term effects). These effects gradually diminish over the first academic year (long-term effects). Using stochastic actor-oriented models, we investigate the long-term trajectory of the intervention effects, while considering alternative network processes, such as reciprocity, transitivity, homophily, and popularity. The results suggest that even though the induced friendship ties are less stable than other friendships, they may serve as early seeds for complex social network processes. Our study shows that simple network interventions can have a pronounced short-term effect and indirect long-term effects on the evolution and structure of student communities.

<title>A network centrality bias: Central individuals in workplace networks have more supportive coworkers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.12.002</url>
<snippet>Combining the results of two empirical studies, we investigate the role of alters' motivation in explaining change in ego's network position over time. People high in communal motives, who are prone to supportive and altruistic behavior in their interactions with others as a way to gain social acceptance, prefer to establish ties with co-workers occupying central positions in organizational social networks. This effect results in a systematic network centrality bias: The personal network of central individuals (individuals with many incoming ties from colleagues) is more likely to contain more supportive and altruistic people than the personal network of in-dividuals who are less central (individuals with fewer incoming ties). This result opens the door to the possibility that the effects of centrality so frequently documented in empirical studies may be due, at least in part, to characteristics of the alters in an ego's personal community, rather than to egos themselves. Our findings invite further empirical research on how alters' motives affect the returns that people can reap from their personal networks in organizations.

<title>Power-use in cooperative competition: A power-dependence model and an empirical test of network structure and geographic mobility</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.01.004</url>
<snippet>Although the social exchange paradigm has produced a vibrant research program, the theoretical tradition is rarely used to model the structure of social networks outside of experiments and simulations. To address this limitation, we derive power-dependence predictions about network structure and geographic mobility-the outcomes of power-use-and test these predictions using complete data on competition networks and travel schedules among amateur sports teams. Poisson regression and exponential random graph models provide strong support for our predictions. The findings illustrate exchange dynamics in which status resources desired by teams, coupled with the availability of geographically proximal alternatives, create power and dependence that dictate where and with whom teams compete. Although evidence supports Georg Simmel's classic proposition that networks form on the basis of values and propinquity, we show that this complex dynamic is conditional on power and dependence. We conclude by discussing implications and directions for future research.

<title>Stability of the personal relationship networks in a longitudinal study of middle school students</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-41787-x</url>
<snippet>The personal network of relationships is structured in circles of friendships, that go from the most intense relationships to the least intense ones. While this is a well established result, little is known about the stability of those circles and their evolution in time. To shed light on this issue, we study the temporal evolution of friendships among teenagers during two consecutive academic years by means of a survey administered on five occasions. We show that the first two circles, best friends and friends, can be clearly observed in the survey but also that being in one or the other leads to more or less stable relationships. We find that being in the same class is one of the key drivers of friendship evolution. We also observe an almost constant degree of reciprocity in the relationships, around 60&#37;, a percentage influenced both by being in the same class and by gender homophily. Not only do our results confirm the mounting evidence supporting the circle structure of human social networks, but they also show that these structures persist in time despite the turnover of individual relationships-a fact that may prove particularly useful for understanding the social environment in middle schools.

<title>Women behaving badly: negative posts on Facebook memorial pages</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1257040</url>
<snippet>This study explores negative posts in Facebook pages dedicated to dead subjects. As with places for mourning in offline environments, memorial pages in Facebook appear to exude a sacred character as objects to both celebrate the life of the deceased and grieve their departure with others. Through a two-step content analysis of an initial sample of 600 pages containing the R.I.P.' acronym in their title, we found, however, a number of posts violating conventional expectations of respect for these mourning spaces. Negative posts in memorial pages take the form of flames (i.e., insults directed at the subject of the page, its administrator, or other visitors), venting (e.g., violent language against the victimizers of the subject of a memorial page), or spam' (i.e., advertisement and content not related to the subject and purpose of the page). Moreover, while results show that most memorial pages in Facebook are created and maintained by women (even thought the subject in the majority of those pages are young males who died an untimely death), they also reveal that women post the majority of negative posts in those pages as well. In other words, whereas women seem to perpetuate traditional offline roles in connection to mourning and grieving rituals, in the online world, they are also the first ones challenging the socially sanctioned sacral attributes of those practices in social networking sites.

<title>Skill complementarity enhances heterophily in collaboration networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep18727</url>
<snippet>Much empirical evidence shows that individuals usually exhibit significant homophily in social networks. We demonstrate, however, skill complementarity enhances heterophily in the formation of collaboration networks, where people prefer to forge social ties with people who have professions different from their own. We construct a model to quantify the heterophily by assuming that individuals choose collaborators to maximize utility. Using a huge database of online societies, we find evidence of heterophily in collaboration networks. The results of model calibration confirm the presence of heterophily. Both empirical analysis and model calibration show that the heterophilous feature is persistent along the evolution of online societies. Furthermore, the degree of skill complementarity is positively correlated with their production output. Our work sheds new light on the scientific research utility of virtual worlds for studying human behaviors in complex socioeconomic systems.

<title>Leadership in informal stormwater governance networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222434</url>
<snippet>Recent transitions in the governance of urban stormwater, specifically developments that leverage the environmental and social benefits of green infrastructure (GI) including infiltration and neighborhood stabilization, often require capacities beyond those of any single municipal- or regional-scale organization. In many cities, transitions toward green storm water infrastructure have been shepherded by networks of individuals spanning a diversity of organizations from governments to NGOs. These networks are often informal, that is, not established by legal mandate, governing authority, or formal agreement, and are often striking for their lack of formal hierarchy or formal leadership. Previous scholarship has revealed the importance of leadership in the development and efficacy of these multiorganizational, cross-sector environmental governance networks, but research has yet to empirically investigate and characterize informal network leaders within the context of GI for stormwater mitigation. To address this gap, we designed and administered a social network analysis (SNA) survey to individuals in a regional network of GI stormwater management professionals in and around Cleveland, Ohio USA. We collected network data on individual relationships, including collaboration and trust, and tested the impact of these relationships on peer-recognition of leaders in the GI network. Our findings suggest that network size, frequency of collaboration, and individual position within the network specifically, betweenness centrality and openness defined and likely supported leaders in the stormwater governance network. Leaders in this non-hierarchical, multi-institution context were more likely to be women and brokerage roles within the network benefitted women, not men, which contrasts with previous findings from research on single-organization and corporate networks. The implications of this research suggest that informal environmental governance networks, such as the GI network investigated, differ substantially from the generally more hierarchical networks of organizations. This finding is useful for municipalities and regional authorities grappling with complex environmental challenges, including transitions in strategies to manage excess stormwater for the protection of municipal drinking water sources and urban freshwater ecosystems.

<title>Dyad vs. network effects: Modeling relationships in personal networks using contextual effects</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.08.020</url>
<snippet>This paper proposes using contextual models to disentangle the effects of dyad characteristics from the effects of characteristics of the networks in which they reside. Multilevel models that nest dyads in personal networks can be coded for contextual analysis by entering both the dyad value of a predictor and the network mean of that predictor into the prediction equation. These models can then be used to measure a within -network effect for dyads and a network contextual effect. This paper conducts an example analysis of how dyad redundancy, and the network's average dyad redundancy, impact discussions of job opportunities. The findings suggest that the dyad and network effects of redundancy are in opposite directions: redundancy has a positive effect at the dyad level and a negative effect at the network level when predicting number of jobs discussed. These results support the major social capital tenets of closure and brokerage, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<title>Exploring Within-Gender Differences in Friendships Using an Online Social Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-024-02906-5</url>
<snippet>People tend to befriend others similar to themselves, generating a pattern called homophily. However, existing studies on friendship patterns often rely on surveys that assess the perspective of relatively few participants on their friendships but do not measure actualized friendship patterns. Here, we used data from a large Slovakian online social network to assess the role of gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) in same-gender online connections among more than 400,000 users. We found that age and BMI homophily occurred in both men's and women's same-gender connections, but somewhat more strongly among men's. Yet, as women diverged in BMI, their connections were less likely to be reciprocated. We discuss how the evolutionary legacy of men's coalitional competition (e.g., warfare) and women's mating competition or recruitment of allocare providers might contribute to these patterns in modern same-gender relationships. For example, men's engagement in physical activities may lead to similar formidability levels among their same-gender peers. Altogether, our findings highlight the importance of trait similarity to same-gender friendship patterns.

<title>Friendship network formation in Chinese middle schools: Patterns of inequality and homophily</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.07.003</url>
<snippet>Previous studies on adolescent friendship network formation emphasize the roles played by individual characteristics, structural opportunities, and endogenous tie formation processes. This study extends previous studies in three major aspects: 1) developing and testing theories of status differential (i.e., friendship ties are more likely to run from low status subjects to high status subjects than vice versa) and differential homophily (i.e., homophily is stronger between high status subjects than between low status subjects) through modeling tie-mixing effects of individual characteristics, 2) including qualitative analyses to elaborate selected mechanisms, and 3) comparing selected friendship patterns between China and the U.S. The extended framework is applied to analyzing survey data obtained from 4,094 students in six middle schools in China. The results show that friendship ties are unevenly distributed by individual characteristics (status differential is confirmed for five of the seven characteristics examined), there is significant tie homophily (stronger homophily among high status subjects than among low status subjects is observed for five of the seven characteristics examined with three of them being statistically significant), and endogenous tie formation processes such as reciprocity, transitivity, and preferential attachment are strongly present. Although some of these patterns are common to both China and the U.S., there are also notable differences between the two. Lastly, I discuss the implications and limitations of this study.

<title>Worth the weight: Conceptualizing and measuring strong versus weak tie homophily</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.06.003</url>
<snippet>Homophily, or the tendency for social contact to occur among those who are similar, plays a crucial role in structuring our social networks. Most previous work considers whether homophily shapes the patterns of all social ties, regardless of their frequency of interaction or level of intimacy. As complex network data become increasingly available, however, researchers need to evaluate whether homophily operates differently for ties defined by strong versus weak measures of strength. Here, I take this approach by first defining two variants of homophily: (1) strong tie homophily, or the tendency for ties with high measures of strength to cluster together similar peers, and (2) weak tie homophily, or the tendency for ties with low edge weights to connect sameattribute actors. Then, I apply valued ERGMs to demonstrate the utility of differentiating between the two variants across simulated and observed networks. In most networks, I find that there are observable differences in the magnitude of strong versus weak tie homophily. Additionally, when there are low levels of clustering on the attribute of interest, distinguishing between strong and weak tie homophily can reveal that these processes operate in opposite directions. Since strong and weak ties carry substantively different implications, I argue that differentiating between the two homophily variants has the potential to uncover novel insights on a variety of social phenomena.

<title>Herding Friends in Similarity-Based Architecture of Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61330-6</url>
<snippet>Although friendship as a social behaviour is an evolved trait that shares many similarities with kinship, there is a key difference: to choose friends, one must select few from many. Homophily, i.e., a similarity-based friendship choice heuristic, has been shown to be the main factor in selecting friends. Its function has been associated with the efficiency of collective action via synchronised mental states. Recent empirical results question the general validity of this explanation. Here I offer an alternative hypothesis: similarity-based friendship choice is an individual-level adaptive response to falling clustering coefficient of the social network typical during urbanisation, falling fertility, increased migration. The mathematical model shows how homophily as a friend-choice heuristic affects the network structure: (1) homophilic friendship choice increases the clustering coefficient; (2) network proximity-based and similarity-based friendship choices have additive effects on the clustering coefficient; and (3) societies that face falling fertility, urbanisation, and migration, are likely go through a u-shaped transition period in terms of clustering coefficient. These findings suggest that social identity can be seen as an emergent phenomenon and is the consequence, rather than the driver of, homophilic social dynamics, and offer an alternative explanation for the rise of "fake news" as a societal phenomenon.

<snippet>Incentive-based models for network formation link micro actions to changes in network structure. Sociologists have extended these models on a number of fronts, but there remains a tendency to treat actors as homogenous agents and to disregard social theory. Drawing upon literature on the strategic use of networks for knowledge gains, we specify models exploring the co-evolution of networks and knowledge gains. Our findings suggest that pursuing transitive ties is the most successful strategy, as more reciprocity and cycling result from this pursuit, thus encouraging learning across the network. We also discuss the role of network size, global network structure, and parameter strength in actors' attainment of knowledge resources.

<title>Computer networks as social networks: Collaborative work, telework, and virtual community</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.213</url>
<snippet>When computer networks link people as well as machines, they become social networks. Such computer-supported social networks (CSSNs) are becoming important bases of virtual communities, computer-supported cooperative work, and telework. Computer-mediated communication such as electronic mail and computerized conferencing is usually text-based and asynchronous. It has limited social presence, and on-line communications are often more uninhibited, creative, and blunt than in-person communication. Nevertheless, CSSNs sustain strong, intermediate, and weak ties that provide information and social support in both specialized and broadly based relationships. CSSNs foster virtual communities that are usually partial and narrowly focused, although some do become encompassing and broadly based. CSSNs accomplish a wide variety of cooperative work, connecting workers within and between organizations who are often physically dispersed. CSSNs also link teleworkers from their homes or remote work centers to main organizational offices. Although many relationships function off-line as well as on-line, CSSNs have developed their own norms and structures. The nature of the medium both constrains and facilitates social control. CSSNs have strong societal implications, fostering situations that combine global connectivity, the fragmentation of solidarities, the de-emphasis of local organizations (in the neighborhood and workplace), and the increased importance of home bases.

<title>The stability of transient relationships</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32206-2</url>
<snippet>In contrast to long-term relationships, far less is known about the temporal evolution of transient relationships, although these constitute a substantial fraction of people's communication networks. Previous literature suggests that ratings of relationship emotional intensity decay gradually until the relationship ends. Using mobile phone data from three countries (US, UK, and Italy), we demonstrate that the volume of communication between ego and its transient alters does not display such a systematic decay, instead showing a lack of any dominant trends. This means that the communication volume of egos to groups of similar transient alters is stable. We show that alters with longer lifetimes in ego's network receive more calls, with the lifetime of the relationship being predictable from call volume within the first few weeks of first contact. This is observed across all three countries, which include samples of egos at different life stages. The relation between early call volume and lifetime is consistent with the suggestion that individuals initially engage with a new alter so as to evaluate their potential as a tie in terms of homophily.

<title>Social Network Research contribution to evaluating process in a feasibility study of a peer-led and school-based sexual health intervention</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90852-w</url>
<snippet>There is growing interest in social network-based programmes to improve health, but rigorous methods using Social Network research to evaluate the process of these interventions is less well developed. Using data from the "STis And Sexual Health" (STASH) feasibility trial of a school-based, peer-led intervention on sexual health prevention, we illustrate how network data analysis results can address key components of process evaluations for complex interventions-implementation, mechanisms of impacts, and context. STASH trained students as Peer Supporters (PS) to diffuse sexual health messages though face-to-face interactions and online Facebook (FB) groups. We applied a Multilevel Exponential Random Graph modelling approach to analyse the interdependence between offline friendship relationships and online FB ties and how these different relationships align. Our results suggest that the creation of online FB communities mirrored offline adolescent groups, demonstrating fidelity of intervention delivery. Data on informal friendship networks related to student's individual characteristics (i.e., demographics, sexual health knowledge and adherence to norms, which were included for STASH), contributed to an understanding of the social relational 'building' mechanisms that sustain tie-formation. This knowledge could assist the selection of opinion leaders, improving identification of influential peers situated in optimal network positions. This work provides a novel contribution to understanding how to integrate network research with the process evaluation of a network intervention.

<title>Individuals' power and their social network accuracy: A situated cognition perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.01.006</url>
<snippet>Individuals differ in how accurately they perceive their social environment, but research and theory provide conflicting predictions on whether powerful people are more or less accurate than others. Drawing on social network theory and the situated cognition theory of power, we examine the relationship between individuals' formal and informal power and their perceptual accuracy of social network relationships. We propose that individuals' perceptual accuracy is related to: 1) their formal and informal power in the organization; 2) the type of relationship being perceived (positive/negative valence) and its relevance to task and goal completion; and 3) the dependence relationship with the target of perception (i.e., whether the perceiver is dependent on the perceived to get their work done). Predictions were tested using cognitive social structure data collected from a technical call center. Results showed that power was generally linked to increased perceptual accuracy, particularly for the types of relationships most relevant for task and goal completion. We further demonstrated that social network accuracy was related to employees' outcomes, including subsequent transfer, promotion, and exit from the organization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

<title>Women Favour Dyadic Relationships, but Men Prefer Clubs: Cross-Cultural Evidence from Social Networking</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118329</url>
<snippet>The ability to create lasting, trust-based friendships makes it possible for humans to form large and coherent groups. The recent literature on the evolution of sociality and on the network dynamics of human societies suggests that large human groups have a layered structure generated by emotionally supported social relationships. There are also gender differences in adult social style which may involve different trade-offs between the quantity and quality of friendships. Although many have suggested that females tend to focus on intimate relations with a few other females, while males build larger, more hierarchical coalitions, the existence of such gender differences is disputed and data from adults is scarce. Here, we present cross-cultural evidence for gender differences in the preference for close friendships. We use a sample of similar to 112,000 profile pictures from nine world regions posted on a popular social networking site to show that, in self-selected displays of social relationships, women favour dyadic relations, whereas men favour larger, all-male cliques. These apparently different solutions to quality-quantity trade-offs suggest a universal and fundamental difference in the function of close friendships for the two sexes.

<title>Gender homophily in online dyadic and triadic relationships</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0080-6</url>
<snippet>Gender homophily, or the preference for interaction with individuals of the same gender, has been observed in many contexts, especially during childhood and adolescence. In this study we investigate such phenomenon by analyzing the interactions of the similar to 10 million users of Tuenti, a Spanish social networking service popular among teenagers. In dyadic relationships we find evidence of higher gender homophily for women. We also observe a preference of users with more friends to connect to the opposite gender. A particularly marked gender difference emerges in signing up for the social networking service and adding the first friends, and in the interactions by means of wall messages. In these contexts we find evidence of a strong homophily for women, and little or no homophily for men. By examining the gender composition of triangle motifs, we observe a marked tendency of users to group into gender homogeneous clusters, with a particularly high number of male-only triangles. We show that age plays an important role in this context, with a tendency to higher homophily for young teenagers in both dyadic and triadic relationships. Our findings have implications for addressing gender gap issues, understanding adolescent online behavior and technology adoption, and modeling social networks.

<title>Strength of Social Tie Predicts Cooperative Investment in a Human Social Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0018338</url>
<snippet>Social networks - diagrams which reflect the social structure of animal groups - are increasingly viewed as useful tools in behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology. Network structure may be especially relevant to the study of cooperation, because the action of mechanisms which affect the cost: benefit ratio of cooperating (e. g. reciprocity, punishment, image scoring) is likely to be mediated by the relative position of actor and recipient in the network. Social proximity could thus affect cooperation in a similar manner to biological relatedness. To test this hypothesis, we recruited members of a real-world social group and used a questionnaire to reveal their network. Participants were asked to endure physical discomfort in order to earn money for themselves and other group members, allowing us to explore relationships between willingness to suffer a cost on another's behalf and the relative social position of donor and recipient. Cost endured was positively correlated with the strength of the social tie between donor and recipient. Further, donors suffered greater costs when a relationship was reciprocated. Interestingly, participants regularly suffered greater discomfort for very close peers than for themselves. Our results provide new insight into the effect of social structure on the direct benefits of cooperation.

<title>Global Network Inference from Ego Network Samples: Testing a Simulation Approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2014.994621</url>
<snippet>Network sampling poses a radical idea: that it is possible to measure global network structure without the full population coverage assumed in most network studies. Network sampling is only useful, however, if a researcher can produce accurate global network estimates. This article explores the practicality of making network inference, focusing on the approach introduced in Smith (2012). The method uses sampled ego network data and simulation techniques to make inference about the global features of the true, unknown network. The validity check here includes more difficult scenarios than previous tests, including those that go beyond the initial scope conditions of the method. I examine networks with a skewed degree distribution and surveys that limit the number of social ties a respondent can list. For each network/survey combination, I take a random ego network sample, run the simulation method, and compare the results to the true values (using measures of connectivity and cohesion). I also test the method on local measures of network structure. The results, on the whole, are encouraging. The method produces good estimates even in cases where the degree distribution is skewed and the survey is strongly restricted. I also find that is it better to not truncate the survey if possible. If the survey must be restricted, the researcher would do well to infer the missing data, rather than use the raw data naively.

<title>Early Social Networks Predict Survival in Wild Bottlenose Dolphins</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0047508</url>
<snippet>A fundamental question concerning group-living species is what factors influence the evolution of sociality. Although several studies link adult social bonds to fitness, social patterns and relationships are often formed early in life and are also likely to have fitness consequences, particularly in species with lengthy developmental periods, extensive social learning, and early social bond-formation. In a longitudinal study of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), calf social network structure, specifically the metric eigenvector centrality, predicted juvenile survival in males. Additionally, male calves that died post-weaning had stronger ties to juvenile males than surviving male calves, suggesting that juvenile males impose fitness costs on their younger counterparts. Our study indicates that selection is acting on social traits early in life and highlights the need to examine the costs and benefits of social bonds during formative life history stages.

<snippet>Social media influencers (SMIs) can be defined as a new type of independent actor who are able to shape audience attitudes through the use of social media channels in competition and coexistence with professional media. Being able to accurately identify SMIs is critical no matter what is being transmitted in a social system. Social Network Analysis (SNA) has been recognized as a powerful tool for representing social network structures and information dissemination. SMIs can be identified by their high-ranking position in a network as the most important or central nodes. The results reveal the existence of three different typologies of SMIs: disseminator, engager and leader. This methodology permits the optimization of resources to create effective online communication strategies.

<title>Untangling the team social capital-team innovation link: The role of proportional task conflict as well as group- and differentiated individual-focused transformational leadership</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00187267221080995</url>
<snippet>Findings from prior research on the relationship between a team's social network architecture and team innovation have been inconclusive. Integrating social network theory with input-process-output models of team innovation, our research aims to reconcile the mixed findings in the literature by introducing a novel process perspective as well as highlighting a relevant contingency factor to untangle the team social capital-team innovation link. We propose that team social capital, operationalized as bridging and bonding social capital, negatively influences team innovation via team proportional task conflict, which is the level of task conflict teams experience proportional to the general level of team conflict (i.e. task, relationship and process conflict). In addition, we expected group and differentiated individual-focused transformational leadership to buffer the negative indirect effect of team social capital on team innovation via team proportional task conflict. Results from time-lagged data collected from research and development teams in Iraq revealed that teams with bonding and bridging social capital are less innovative because they experience less proportional task conflict. Furthermore, group-focused transformational leadership buffered the negative indirect relationship of team bridging social capital on team innovation via proportional task conflict. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

<title>Alcohol use among adolescents as a coordination problem in a dynamic network</title>

<snippet>Whereas most research on substance (ab)use by adolescents studies only the effects of personal networks of adolescents, we propose a theoretical approach that allows for predictions on the effects of the macro-level social network structure on usage rates. We model alcohol use as risk-dominant but inefficient behaviour in a coordination problem, given that adolescents face incentives to align their behaviour with their friends. We propose a game-theoretical model in which actors choose behaviour in a repeated coordination game in an endogenous network. Predictions on levels of alcohol use depending on initial network structure are based on computer simulations of this model. We test the predictions using longitudinal data on alcohol use and friendship choices in school classes in Dutch high schools. We replicate the predicted 'catalysing' effect of initial network density on the development of alcohol use but the predicted opposing effect of centralization could not be confirmed.

<title>Model Adequacy Checking/Goodness-of-fit Testing for Behavior in Joint Dynamic Network/Behavior Models, with an Extension to Two-mode Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0049124120914933</url>
<snippet>The recent popularity of models that capture the dynamic coevolution of both network structure and behavior has driven the need for summary indices to assess the adequacy of these models to reproduce dynamic properties of scientific or practical importance. Whereas there are several existing indices for assessing the ability of the model to reproduce network structure over time, to date there are few indices for assessing the ability of the model to reproduce individuals' behavior patterns. Drawing on the widely used strategy of assessing model adequacy by comparing index values summarizing features of the observed data to the distribution of those index values on simulated data from the fitted model, we propose four goals that a researcher could reasonably expect of a joint structure/behavior model regarding how well it captures behavior and describe indices for assessing each of these. These reasonably simple and easily implemented indices can be used for assessing model adequacy with any dynamic network models jointly working with networks and behavior, including the stochastic actor-based models implemented within software packages such as RSien version 1.2-24. We demonstrate the use of our indices with an empirical example to show how they can be employed in practical settings, with an additional extension to modeling affiliation dynamics in two-mode networks.

<title>Network Contacts and Activity Domains: Information-Sharing among Police Agencies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.17730/humo.73.1.m3l5104p46423p75</url>
<snippet>We investigate whether the structure of network relations is linked to the nature of network participants' activities. In the organizational setting, organizational activities in different domains likely have different informational needs, and, therefore, network relations may reflect the particular activities they support. Similarity in the network relations associated with various domains may reflect similarity in the inherent "meanings" or content of the domains. We investigated this using American police agency planners' reported network contacts in 11 policing domains. The correspondence analysis plot of the policing domains, and measures of fit with an a priori classification of domains by meaning, indicated that patterns of overlap in network contacts substantially reflected inherent similarities among domains. Meanings associated with the relations involved in multiplex ties appear to be an important element of network structure.

<snippet>There is developing interest in the role of social networks in migratory experiences of highly skilled migrants. While there is some research on the networking of single economic actors, there is less focus on the social ties associated with family life and parenting among highly skilled migrants. The limited research that has been undertaken, mainly in the USA, points to the role of trailing wives' in building local social relationships. This article draws on a study of French highly skilled families in London, and explores the role of women in negotiating access to local social ties. Following Eve, we use social network theory to explore the composition, function and dynamism of these social relationships and develop a sociological explanation' of networking strategies. We contribute to understanding the human face' of highly skilled migrants, by examining the opportunities and the unanticipated obstacles they encounter in building new social ties.

<title>Group differences in reciprocity, multiplexity and exchange: measures and application</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-011-9465-6</url>
<snippet>Local forces structure social networks. One major and widely researched local force is reciprocity, often assumed to work homogeneously across actors-i.e., all actors are equally subject to the same level of force towards reciprocity. Other local forces, like multiplexity and exchange, are also often assumed to apply equally to different actors. But social theory provides us with ample arguments why such forces might be stronger in some subsets of actors than others, or why such forces might affect intergroup ties more than intragroup ties. In this paper we introduce standard measures to capture these group specific forces towards reciprocity, multiplexity, and exchange. All the measures control for differential tendencies of actors to initiate ties of various types. We also introduce a procedure by which differences in the strength of these forces between groups and subgroups can be statistically evaluated.

<title>Delinquency, Social Skills and the Structure of Peer Relations: Assessing Criminological Theories by Social Network Theory</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/sof.2010.0069</url>
<snippet>This article explores the plausibility of the conflicting theoretical assumptions underlying the main criminological perspectives on juvenile delinquents, their peer relations and social skills: the social ability model, represented by Sutherland's theory of differential associations, and the social disability model, represented by Hirschi's control theory. It does so by applying the principles associated with Granovetter's theory of strong and weak ties, drawing out its theoretical implications for the criminological theories and deriving a number of hypotheses. The article uses "strategic research materials" in the form of a data set strongly biased towards the social disability model and containing information on co-offending relations among a population (N = 580) of juveniles in a Swedish town during a three-year period. Results from cross-sectional empirical analyses using, among other things, the Quadratic Assignment Procedure, clearly support the social ability model. The robustness of the initial analyses is checked through longitudinal analyses applying actor-oriented statistical models for network evolution. The article's implications for criminological, as well as multidisciplinary, research are discussed.

Our model is based on a new way of quantifying the tie-strength, which in turn considers the affinity and relevance between nodes. We could verify that the messages to inform and influence, as well as their importance, produce different propagation behaviors in an online social network. We carried out laboratory tests with our model and with the baseline models Linear Threshold and Independent Cascade, which are currently used in many scientific works. The results were evaluated by comparing them with empirical data. The tests show conclusively that the predictions of our model are notably more accurate and precise than the predictions of the baseline models. Our model can contribute to the development of models that maximize the propagation of messages; to predict the spread of viruses in computer networks, mobile telephony and online social networks.

<title>Information communities: The network structure of communication</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.02.001</url>
<snippet>This study puts forward a variable clique overlap model for identifying information communities, or potentially overlapping subgroups of network actors among whom reinforced independent links ensure efficient communication. We posit that the average intensity of communication between related individuals in information communities is greater than in other areas of the network. Empirical tests show that the variable clique overlap model is indeed more effective in identifying groups of individuals that have strong internal relationships in communication networks relative to prior cohesive subgroup models; the pathways generated by such an arrangement of connections are particularly robust against disruptions of information transmission. Our findings extend the scope of network closure effects proposed by other researchers working with communication networks using social network methods and approaches, a tradition which emphasizes ties between organizations, groups, individuals, and the external environment.

<title>At the intersection of criminal justice involvement and sexual orientation: Dynamic networks and health among a population-based sample of young Black men who have sex with men</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2017.04.001</url>
<snippet>Mass incarceration of young Black men has a significant impact on their network composition and stability that, in turn, may have major implications for health and well-being. A sub-group of young Black men with criminal justice involvement (CJI) identify as gay, bisexual or are non-identified men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM). This paper focuses on the potential effects of CJI on the composition of Black MSM social and sexual networks, their stability over time, and concomitant health and social outcomes. We use data from the UConnect study, a population-based cohort of young Black MSM 16-29 years of age (n = 618) selected using respondent -driven sampling in Chicago from 2013 to 2016. Both confidant and sexual network name generators and interpreters were administered at 9-month intervals over three waves of data collection. Ego and dyadic-level data were collected on behaviors prevalent among MSM and including factors associated with network CJI, network stability, and health outcomes. Generalized Structural Equation Models (GSEM) were utilized to determine the relationship between CJI network composition, network stability and behaviors prevalent among young Black MSM and their networks. In the UConnect cohort, 46&#37; had at least once been detained, arrested or spent time in jail or prison. In addition, 20&#37; of participants reported incident CJI over the study period. Respondents with a history of CJI were significantly more likely to have CJI homophily in their confidant and sexual networks. Multivariate analyses demonstrate that the association between one's history of CJI, housing instability and drug use is partially explained by one's network CJI. In addition, a higher prevalence of network CJI is associated with increased turnover in the confidant network, and this network instability is also related to important health and social outcomes. This analysis describes the networks of criminal justice involved men among a representative sample of young Black MSM and demonstrates the relationship between CJI network homophily, network stability and their impact on several key health and social outcomes relevant to this population.

<title>Cumulative effects of triadic closure and homophily in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aax7310</url>
<snippet>Social network structure has often been attributed to two network evolution mechanisms-triadic closure and choice homophily-which are commonly considered independently or with static models. However, empirical studies suggest that their dynamic interplay generates the observed homophily of real-world social networks. By combining these mechanisms in a dynamic model, we confirm the longheld hypothesis that choice homophily and triadic closure cause induced homophily. We estimate how much observed homophily in friendship and communication networks is amplified due to triadic closure. We find that cumulative effects of homophily amplification can also lead to the widely documented core-periphery structure of networks, and to memory of homophilic constraints (equivalent to hysteresis in physics). The model shows that even small individual bias may prompt network-level changes such as segregation or core group dominance. Our results highlight that individuallevel mechanisms should not be analyzed separately without considering the dynamics of society as a whole.

<title>Community and Drug Use among Gay Men: The Role of Neighborhoods and Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022146510395026</url>
<snippet>Gay neighborhoods serve as vital places for gay men's socializing, yet few studies have examined their contributions to gay men's health-either directly or indirectly via residents' social networks. Drawing from theoretical perspectives on community and networks, we test hypotheses concerning whether gay neighborhoods and social network factors are associated with patterns of recent illicit drug use among a sample of 740 urban gay men from New York City. Higher odds of drug use were observed among individuals who resided in gay neighborhoods, had networks composed predominantly of other gay men, and had increased socialization with gay men. Network factors did not mediate associations between gay neighborhoods and drug use. These findings highlight the need to better contextualize the health risks faced by gay men by accounting for both neighborhood and network structures.

<title>The statistical evaluation of social network dynamics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/0081-1750.00099</url>
<snippet>A class of statistical models is proposed for longitudinal network data. The dependent variable is the changing (or evolving) relation network, represented by two or more observations of a directed graph with a fixed set of actors. The network evolution is modeled as the consequence of the actors making new choices, or withdrawing existing choices, on the basis of functions, with fixed and random components, that the actors try to maximize. Individual and dyadic exogenous variables can be used as covariates. The change in the network is modeled as the stochastic result of network effects (reciprocity, transitivity, etc.) and these covariates. The existing network structure is a dynamic constraint for the evolution of the structure itself. The models are continuous-time Markov chain models that can be implemented as simulation models. The model parameters are estimated from observed data. For estimating and testing these models, statistical procedures are proposed that are based on the method of moments. The statistical procedures are implemented using a stochastic approximation algorithm based on computer simulations of the network evolution process.

<title>Cheater's hide and seek: Strategic cognitive network activation during ethical decision making</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.03.005</url>
<snippet>We consider the dynamic process by which people cognitively activate their social networks during ethical decision making. We compare actors' goals during anticipatory and ex-post phases of ethical decision making, and propose that they trigger hide-and-seek patterns of network activation. Experiment 1 links cognitively activated network structures with self-report ethical behavior. Consistent with "hiding goals," actors randomly assigned to anticipate behaving unethically (versus honestly or in the control condition), activated sparser networks that could better hide unethicality (Experiment 2). Consistent with "seeking" goals, participants randomly assigned to unethical (versus honest) conditions mentally activated dense networks, seeking out social support to uphold their sense of self (Experiment 3a). This network activation process is mitigated when participants affirm themselves (Experiment 3b). Experiment 4 replicates these hide and seek patterns of social network activation in a single study that captures both the anticipatory and ex-post phases of ethical decision making.

<title>A Structural Model of Homophily and Clustering in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2021.1930013</url>
<snippet>I develop and estimate a structural model of network formation with heterogeneous players and latent community structure, whose equilibrium homophily and clustering levels match those usually observed in real-world social networks. Players belong to communities unobserved by the econometrician and have community-specific payoffs, allowing preferences to have a bias for similar people. Players meet sequentially and decide whether to form bilateral links, after receiving a random matching shock. The model converges to a hierarchical exponential family random graph. Using school friendship network data from Add Health, I estimate the posterior distribution of parameters and unobserved heterogeneity, detecting high levels of racial homophily and payoff heterogeneity across communities. The posterior predictions of sufficient statistics show that the model is able to replicate the homophily levels and the aggregate clustering of the observed network, in contrast with standard exponential family network models without community structure.

<title>Network Effects and Social Inequality</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102545</url>
<snippet>Students of social inequality have noted the presence of mechanisms militating toward cumulative advantage and increasing inequality. Social scientists have established that individuals' choices are influenced by those of their network peers in many social domains. We suggest that the ubiquity of network effects and tendencies toward cumulative advantage are related. Inequality is exacerbated when effects of individual differences are multiplied by social networks: when persons must decide whether to adopt beneficial practices; when network externalities, social learning, or normative pressures influence adoption decisions; and when networks are homophilous with respect to individual characteristics that predict such decisions. We review evidence from literatures on network effects on technology, labor markets, education, demography, and health; identify several mechanisms through which networks may generate higher levels of inequality than one would expect based on differences in initial endowments alone; consider cases in which network effects may ameliorate inequality; and describe research priorities.

<title>Exploring communication networks to understand organizational crisis using exponential random graph models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-011-9104-8</url>
<snippet>In recent social network studies, exponential random graph (ERG) models have been used comprehensively to model global social network structure as a function of their local features. In this study, we describe the ERG models and demonstrate its use in modelling the changing communication network structure at Enron Corporation during the period of its disintegration. We illustrate the modelling on communication networks, and provide a new way of classifying networks and their performance based on the occurrence of their local features. Among several micro-level structures of ERG models, we find significant variation in the appearance of A2P (Alternating k-two-paths) network structure in the communication network during crisis period and non-crisis period. We also notice that the attribute of hierarchical positions of actors (i.e., high rank versus low rank staff) have impact on the evolution process of networks during crisis. These findings could be used in analyzing communication networks of dynamic project groups and their adaptation process during crisis which could lead to an improved understanding how communications network evolve and adapt during crisis.

<title>Identity-based learning and segregation in social networks under different institutional environments</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-013-9169-7</url>
<snippet>To study the evolution of segregation in social networks across systems embedded in different institutional environments, we develop an identity-based learning model where segregation is stochastically conditioned by the initial distribution of the actor's attention to identity and the updating of this distribution over time. The updating process, which we call the process of mutual learning multiplier, is based on an actor's success and failure experiences in tying with the same-subgroup and cross-subgroup actors. Results from a Monte Carlo simulation of the model show that the mutual learning multiplier produces disproportional relationships between the initial distribution of identity attention and the level of segregation in social networks. We also find that those relationships are affected by the actors' attention to structural holes, rate of learning from experience, system size, and the identity heterogeneity of the system. Overall, the model provides insights into various dynamics of network structuration across time and space.

<title>Thinking you&amp;apos;re different matters more for belonging than being different</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58252-y</url>
<snippet>Belonging to a community is essential for wellbeing, but potentially unattainable for those dissimilar from a group. In the present work, we ask whether belongingness is better predicted by acting and thinking like peers or believing you act and think like peers. Students (N = 1181) reported their belonging and how much they, their friends, and an "average student" endorsed local behavioral norms and general values. We calculated difference scores for behaviors and values capturing perceived similarity to the average, actual similarity to the average, and accuracy around the norm. Key results indicate that perceived behavioral similarity to the average, when controlling for other differences, predicts belonging and most robustly mediates between identity and belonging. Using social network analysis, we find behavioral differences from friends are meaningfully linked to network density and racial homophily. Efficient interventions for enhanced belonging could highlight similarities between students and their peers.

<title>Representing Micro-Macro Linkages by Actor-based Dynamic Network Models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0049124113494573</url>
<snippet>Stochastic actor-based models for network dynamics have the primary aim of statistical inference about processes of network change, but may be regarded as a kind of agent-based models. Similar to many other agent-based models, they are based on local rules for actor behavior. Different from many other agent-based models, by including elements of generalized linear statistical models they aim to be realistic detailed representations of network dynamics in empirical data sets. Statistical parallels to micro-macro considerations can be found in the estimation of parameters determining local actor behavior from empirical data, and the assessment of goodness of fit from the correspondence with network-level descriptives. This article studies several network-level consequences of dynamic actor-based models applied to represent cross-sectional network data. Two examples illustrate how network-level characteristics can be obtained as emergent features implied by microspecifications of actor-based models.

<title>Physical activity promotion in an urban district: Analyzing the mechanisms of interorganizational cooperation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260053</url>
<snippet>Past research has identified the importance of cooperation among community-based organizations from different sectors to address public health problems such as insufficient physical activity. However, little is known about how and why interorganizational cooperation occurs. The present study sought to analyze the structure and emergent patterns of interorganizational cooperation within a network promoting physical activity based in an urban district neighborhood of a city in Southwestern Germany. Survey data on cooperative relations among 61 network organizations and organizational attributes (e.g., possession of sport facilities) were collected. Social network analysis was applied to examine network properties and exponential random graph models were estimated to test hypotheses concerning mechanisms and conditions of cooperative tie formation. The results show that the network of cooperation is sparse but characterized by a tendency for cooperation to occur in triangular structures. Other significant mechanisms of cooperative tie formation are preferential attachment, with the community department for education and sports being the most central network actor, and heterophily regarding the cooperation of organizations from different sectors. This study provides valid and reliable findings on conditions of network formation and significant mechanisms of interorganizational cooperation in the field of physical activity promotion. Knowledge about these mechanisms can help to manage networks effectively and efficiently and reveal potentials for improvement and intensification of interorganizational cooperation in both the present and other research areas of health promotion.

<title>The Social Origins of Networks and Diffusion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/681275</url>
<snippet>Recent research on social contagion has demonstrated significant effects of network topology on the dynamics of diffusion. However, network topologies are not given a priori. Rather, they are patterns of relations that emerge from individual and structural features of society, such as population composition, group heterogeneity, homophily, and social consolidation. Following Blau and Schwartz, the author develops a model of social network formation that explores how social and structural constraints on tie formation generate emergent social topologies and then explores the effectiveness of these social networks for the dynamics of social diffusion. Results show that, at one extreme, high levels of consolidation can create highly balkanized communities with poor integration of shared norms and practices. As suggested by Blau and Schwartz, reducing consolidation creates more crosscutting circles and significantly improves the dynamics of social diffusion across the population. However, the author finds that further reducing consolidation creates highly intersecting social networks that fail to support the widespread diffusion of norms and practices, indicating that successful social diffusion can depend on moderate to high levels of structural consolidation.

<title>The structure and function of antagonistic ties in village social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2401257121</url>
<snippet>Negative or antagonistic relationships are common in human social networks, but they are less often studied than positive or friendly relationships. The existence of a capacity to have and to track antagonistic ties raises the possibility that they may serve a useful function in human groups. Here, we analyze empirical data gathered from 24,770 and 22,513 individuals in 176 rural villages in Honduras in two survey waves 2.5 y apart in order to evaluate the possible relevance of antagonistic relationships for broader network phenomena. We find that the small -world effect is more significant in a positive world with negative ties compared to an otherwise similar hypothetical positive world without them. Additionally, we observe that nodes with more negative ties tend to be located near network bridges, with lower clustering coefficients, higher betweenness centralities, and shorter average distances to other nodes in the network. Positive connections tend to have a more localized distribution, while negative connections are more globally dispersed within the networks. Analysis of the possible impact of such negative ties on dynamic processes reveals that, remarkably, negative connections can facilitate the dissemination of information (including novel information experimentally introduced into these villages) to the same degree as positive connections, and that they can also play a role in mitigating idea polarization within village networks. Antagonistic ties hold considerable importance in shaping the structure and function of social networks.

<title>Advances in biased net theory: definitions, derivations, and estimations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2004.01.005</url>
<snippet>Random and biased net theory, introduced by Rapoport and others in the 1950s, is one of the earliest approaches to the formal modeling of social networks. In this theory, intended as a theory of large-scale networks, ties between nodes derive both from random and non-random events of connection. The non-random connections are postulated to arise through "bias" events that incorporate known or suspected systematic tendencies in tie formation, such as, mutuality or reciprocity, transitivity or closure in triads, and homophily-the overrepresentation of ties between persons who share important socio-demographic attributes like race/ethnicity or level of educational attainment. A key problem for biased net theory has been analytical intractability of the models. Formal derivations require approximation assumptions and model parameters have been difficult to estimate. The accuracy of the derived formulas and the estimated parameters has been difficult to assess. In this paper, we attempt to address long-standing issues in biased net models stemming from their analytical intractability. We first reformulate and clarify the definitions of basic biases. Second, we derive from first principles the triad distribution in a biased net, using two different analytical strategies to check our derivations. Third, we set out a pseudo-likelihood method for parameter estimation of key bias parameters and then check the accuracy of this relatively simple but approximate scheme against the results obtained from the triad distribution derivation.

<title>A 'Different Class'? Homophily and Heterophily in the Social Class Networks of Britpop</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1749975517712045</url>
<snippet>Social network analysis is increasingly recognised as a useful way to explore music scenes. In this article we examine the individuals who were the cultural workforce that comprised the Britpop' music scene of the 1990s. The focus of our analysis is homophily and heterophily to determine whether the clusters of friendships and working relationships of those who were best connected' in the scene were patterned by original social class position. We find that Britpop's whole network' is heterophilic but that its sub-networks' are more likely to be social class homophilic. The sub-networks that remain heterophilic are likely to be united by other common experiences that brought individuals in the network to the same social spaces. We suggest that our findings on Britpop might be generalised to the composition of other music scenes, cultural workforces and aggregations of young people. Our study differs from research on, first, British indie music' and social class which focuses upon the construction, representation and performance of social location rather than the relationships it might shape and second, the pioneering social network analyses of music scenes which currently lack explicit emphasis on social class.

<title>Immigrant children and their parents: Is there an intergenerational interdependence of integration into social networks?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.11.002</url>
<snippet>The paper investigates the integration of immigrant children and their parents in different dimensions of social networks - referred to as multiplexity in social network terminology. These dimensions are children's friendships, their attendance at birthday parties, and contact among their parents. By attending birthday parties, children's friendships are publicly reinforced and membership in a social circle is signified. During these events, communication and social exchange drive the process of social integration at the micro-level, and ethnic boundaries can be shifted or blurred. It will be shown that a variety of homophily effects can be found in all three network dimensions. In addition, ethnic segregation in parents' networks has an impact on children's participation in these events and, thereby, on children's integration in social networks. However, the causal effect in the other way around - children's birthday party attendance on contact among their parents - is even stronger. A new approach is the non-recursive analysis of how ties in one network dimension effect ties in another dimension. Analyses are based on 76 social networks of 1266 children in school classes in the city state of Bremen, Germany.

<title>Spatiotemporal network structure among "friends of friends" reveals contagious disease process</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237168</url>
<snippet>Disease transmission can be identified in a social network from the structural patterns of contact. However, it is difficult to separate contagious processes from those driven by homophily, and multiple pathways of transmission or inexact information on the timing of infection can obscure the detection of true transmission events. Here, we analyze the dynamic social network of a large, and near-complete population of 16,430 zoo birds tracked daily over 22 years to test a novel "friends-of-friends" strategy for detecting contagion in a social network. The results show that cases of avian mycobacteriosis were significantly clustered among pairs of birds that had been in direct contact. However, since these clusters might result due to correlated traits or a shared environment, we also analyzed pairs of birds that had never been in direct contact but were indirectly connected in the network via other birds. The disease was also significantly clustered among these friends of friends and a reverse-time placebo test shows that homophily could not be causing the clustering. These results provide empirical evidence that at least some avian mycobacteriosis infections are transmitted between birds, and provide new methods for detecting contagious processes in large-scale global network structures with indirect contacts, even when transmission pathways, timing of cases, or etiologic agents are unknown.

<title>Effects of population dispersal on regional signaling networks: An example from northern Iroquoia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1700497</url>
<snippet>The dispersal of Iroquoian groups from St. Lawrence River valley during the 15th and 16th centuries A.D. has been a source of archaeological inquiry for decades. Social network analysis presented here indicates that sites from Jefferson County, New York at the head of the St. Lawrence River controlled interactions within regional social signaling networks during the 15th century A.D. Measures indicate that Jefferson County sites were in brokerage liaison positions between sites in New York and Ontario. In the network for the subsequent century, to which no Jefferson County sites are assigned, no single group took the place of Jefferson County in controlling network flow. The dispersal of Jefferson County populations effectively ended this brokerage function concomitant with the emergence of the nascent Huron-Wendat and Iroquois confederacies and may have contributed to the escalation of conflict between these entities. These results add to a growing literature on the use of network analyses with archaeological data and contribute new insights into processes of population relocation and geopolitical realignment, as well as the role of borderlands and frontiers in nonstate societies.

<title>Social networks and environmental outcomes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1523245113</url>
<snippet>Social networks can profoundly affect human behavior, which is the primary force driving environmental change. However, empirical evidence linking microlevel social interactions to large-scale environmental outcomes has remained scarce. Here, we leverage comprehensive data on information-sharing networks among large-scale commercial tuna fishers to examine how social networks relate to shark bycatch, a global environmental issue. We demonstrate that the tendency for fishers to primarily share information within their ethnic group creates segregated networks that are strongly correlated with shark bycatch. However, some fishers share information across ethnic lines, and examinations of their bycatch rates show that network contacts are more strongly related to fishing behaviors than ethnicity. Our findings indicate that social networks are tied to actions that can directly impact marine ecosystems, and that biases toward within-group ties may impede the diffusion of sustainable behaviors. Importantly, our analysis suggests that enhanced communication channels across segregated fisher groups could have prevented the incidental catch of over 46,000 sharks between 2008 and 2012 in a single commercial fishery.

<title>Social class, social networks and variety of weak and strong practices</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/soc4.13124</url>
<snippet>Most research on the structural foundations of cultural consumption views tastes and practices as a better or worse emanation of social class or status. In contrast, this paper shows that cultural consumption is also embedded in a larger system of social networks. Not only does it examine whether having more diversified personal network translates into being involved in a wider range of cultural activities (omnivorousness), it also tests whether holding networks of different strength corresponds with different levels of cultural engagement (strong vs. weak). Based on the survey data collected in Poland in 2017, the analyses yield three main findings. First, cultural consumption continues to reflect social class divisions and is a potential mechanism for social exclusion. Second, network diversity is associated with cultural variety independently of class position. Third, the number of weak ties people hold is more strongly associated with the number of "weak" practices (that is practices of less frequency) and the number of strong ties is positively associated with the number of strong practices (voraciousness). These findings are discussed in terms of balance theory, interactional foci and weak versus strong culture. The implications of the article are that omnivorism both signifies class boundaries and indicates participation in different network structures.

<title>How does socioeconomic homophily emerge? Testing for the contribution of different processes to socioeconomic segregation in adolescent friendships</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.09.002</url>
<snippet>Homophily - the fact that friendships happen at a higher rate among similar individuals - does not necessarily imply homophilic selection - the tendency to look for similar friends. This is particularly true for socioeconomic homophily: because individuals' social class impacts most aspects of their lives, there are several ways in which it can favor homogeneity in friendship networks. Applying this view to the relationships of French middle-school students, the present article tries to unravel the contribution of various relational processes to the emergence of socioeconomic homophily. Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models, a class of generative models designed for network panel data, are applied to the friendship networks of 820 students surveyed over a year and a half. Simulations derived from the estimated models are then used to assess the impact of different processes on aggregated levels of homophily. To that aim, a new metric is proposed that help researchers decompose an observed property of a network into a set of contributions from low-order processes, called "contribution scores". Results suggest that direct homophilic selection can be important in explaining socioeconomic homophily, but not in all cases. Indirect inducers, such as residential propinquity or ethnic selection, also play a significant role. Moreover, endogenous network processes - namely reciprocation and transitive closure - strongly contribute to homophily by reinforcing other homophily-inducing processes.

<title>Sources of Friendship and Structurally Induced Homophily across the Life Course</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0731121419828399</url>
<snippet>How people meet new friends changes throughout life in ways that change the potential for diverse friendships. This study presents results from the first U.S. survey with data on how respondents met their friends, specifically the two nonfamily friends they most often socialize with. The most common sources of new friendships shift across life from the dominance of schooling during youth, to the centrality of work in midlife, to neighbors and voluntary groups in later life. Educational homophily peaks for friendships made in midlife, and is strongest for friendships made in higher education and at work. Racial homophily generally declines as people age but is lowest for men in midlife, while decreasing later for women. Friendship sources largely account for life course changes in racial homophily, but not educational homophily. The racial homophily induced by friendship sources also changes as people age, but in different ways for women and men.

<title>Opinion dynamics of online social network users: a micro-level analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2021.1956917</url>
<snippet>In this paper, we present an empirical study of the opinion dynamics of a large-scale sample of online social network users. We estimate users' opinions as continuous scalars based on their subscriptions to information sources and analyze how friendship connections affect the dynamics of these estimations. Distinguishing between positive (toward friends' opinions) and negative (away from friends' opinions) opinion shifts, we find that the existence and magnitude of both types of shifts are positively related (largely through linear or inverted U-shaped form) to the distance in opinions between a user and their friends. The distance additionally moderates the balance between positive and negative movements: if the distance is within a certain moderate range, there is a relatively high chance of a positive shift.

<title>Effects of Online Christian Self-Disclosure on Impression Formation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-5906.2010.01522.x</url>
<snippet>This experiment examined the effects of online Christian disclosure. Respondents (N = 233) viewed a fictional social networking profile containing one of three levels of Christian disclosure frequency: none, nominal, and extensive. Respondents made few distinctions between nondisclosure and nominal disclosure. Most notably, respondent religiosity moderated impressions. Regardless of disclosure level, religious respondents rated profile owners as more likeable and less stereotypically negative than less religious respondents. The least religious respondents tended to rate the extensively disclosing Christian as least romantically desirable and with more negative stereotyping. The most religious respondents rated the extensively disclosing Christian as most likeable and as most romantically desirable. Christian identity tended to be assumed when not disclosed. Nominal disclosure may constitute a socially acceptable level of online Christian disclosure.

<title>The Emergence and Stability of Groups in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.10.008</url>
<snippet>An important puzzle in social network research is to explain how macro-level structures emerge from micro-level network processes. Explaining the emergence and stability of structural groups in social networks is particularly difficult for two reasons. First, because groups are characterized both by high connectedness within (group cohesion) and lack of connectedness between them (group boundaries). Second, because a large number of theoretical micro-level network processes contribute to their emergence. We argue that traditional social network theories that are concerned with the evolution of positive relations (forces of attraction) are not sufficient to explain the emergence of groups because they lack mechanisms explaining the emergence of group boundaries. Models that additionally account for the evolution of negative ties (forces of repulsion) may be better suited to explain the emergence and stability of groups. We build a theoretical model and illustrate its usefulness by fitting stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs) to empirical data of co-evolving networks of friendship and dislike among 479 secondary-school students. The SAOMs include a number of newly developed effects expressing the co-evolution between positive and negative ties. We then simulate networks from the estimated models to explore the micro-macro link. We find that a model that considers forces of attraction and repulsion simultaneously is better at explaining groups in social networks. In the long run, however, the empirically informed simulations generate networks that are too stylized to be realistic, raising further questions about model degeneracy and time heterogeneity of group processes.

<title>Bayesian testing of scientific expectations under exponential random graph models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.11.004</url>
<snippet>The exponential random graph (ERGM) model is a commonly used statistical framework for studying the determinants of tie formations from social network data. To test scientific theories under ERGMs, statistical inferential techniques are generally used based on traditional significance testing using p-values. This method-ology has certain limitations, however, such as its inconsistent behavior when the null hypothesis is true, its inability to quantify evidence in favor of a null hypothesis, and its inability to test multiple hypotheses with competing equality and/or order constraints on the parameters of interest in a direct manner. To tackle these shortcomings, this paper presents Bayes factors and posterior probabilities for testing scientific expectations under a Bayesian framework. The methodology is implemented in the R package BFpack. The applicability of the methodology is illustrated using empirical collaboration networks and policy networks.

<title>Micro Effects on Macro Structure in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00811750231209040</url>
<snippet>How do individuals' network selection decisions create unique network structures? Despite broad sociological interest in the micro-level social interactions that create macro-level network structure, few methods are available to statistically evaluate micro-macro relationships in social networks. This study introduces a general methodological framework for testing the effect of (micro) network selection processes, such as homophily, reciprocity, or preferential attachment, on unique (macro) network structures, such as segregation, clustering, or brokerage. The approach uses estimates from a statistical network model to decompose the contributions of each parameter to a node, subgraph, or global network statistic specified by the researcher. A flexible parametric algorithm is introduced to estimate variances, confidence intervals, and p values. Prior micro-macro network methods can be regarded as special cases of the general framework. Extensions to hypothetical network interventions, joint parameter tests, and longitudinal and multilevel network data are discussed. An example is provided analyzing the micro foundations of political segregation in a crime policy collaboration network.

<title>Alliance-building for equity and justice: An inter-organizational perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2023.102382</url>
<snippet>Cultivating alliances between specific sectors or fields with unrealized synergies is a promising strategy for systems change. Social network analysis is a useful tool for assessing whether such alliances build relationships between these previously disparate organizations. Two waves of valued network data were collected from the members (N = 25) of a justice system reform coalition composed of two types of community-based organizations: those involved in restorative justice practice and those involved in grassroots community organizing. Social network homophily analyses were employed to characterize the impact of alliance participation on relationships over time across three domains: working together, doing impactful work together, and sharing a philosophy about justice system reform. Results indicate marked increases in the prevalence of relationships between restorative justice and community organizing organizations across all domains, with the greatest increases occurring in perceptions of shared philosophy. Network structures at each time point differed by relational domain and organization type. Findings suggest that the alliance strengthened relationships between restorative justice and community organizing organizations, particularly in perceptions of shared philosophy, but that the magnitude of these changes varied depending on pre-existing interorganizational relationships and organization type. Findings challenge the idea that close working relationships between diverse members is critical to coalition effectiveness, pointing instead to the value of ambidextrous networks and alignment in members' philosophy and vision.

<title>DYNAMICS OF STRUCTURE - AN INDIVIDUAL ORIENTED APPROACH</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-8733(94)90014-0</url>
<snippet>The dynamics of network structure are considered, here as a consequence of individual choices with regard to relationships. We introduce the individual- or object-oriented modelling approach to model social networks. Object-oriented model building is based on acting so-called 'objects', communicating with and reacting to each other. Individuals are modelled as objects, each object with the possibility of having specific characteristics and behavioral rules. In contrast to many existing studies in the field of dynamic social networks, heterogeneity and dependence of dyads can easily be dealt with using this method. To clarify the new approach, we present a first simple model of the arising of friendship networks. For this simplicity, the model presented here is based solely on individuals' different needs for social contact, but can easily be extended. We present results about the effect of the distribution of individual needs on the network emergent structure.

<title>A multilevel network study of the effects of delinquent behavior on friendship evolution</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222500305892</url>
<snippet>A multilevel approach is proposed to the study of the evolution of multiple networks. In this approach, the basic evolution process is assumed to be the same, while parameter values may differ between different networks. For the network evolution process, stochastic actor-oriented models are used, of which the parameters are estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. This is applied to the study of effects of delinquent behavior on friendship formation, a question of long standing in criminology. The evolution of friendship is studied empirically in 19 school classes. It is concluded that there is evidence for an effect of similarity in delinquent behavior on friendship evolution. Similarity of the degree of delinquent behavior has a positive effect on tie formation but also on tie dissolution. The last result seems to contradict current criminological theories, and deserves further study.

<title>Embedded Distress: Social Integration, Gender, and Adolescent Depression</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/soac034</url>
<snippet>In adolescence, teens manage close friendships while simultaneously evaluating their social position in the larger peer context. Conceptualizing distinct local and global network structures clarifies how social integration relates to mental wellbeing. Examining local cohesion and global embeddedness in the context of key factors related to mental health, such as gender and friends' depression, can further distinguish when the structure and content of social integration relate to higher and lower depressive levels. Analyses using survey data from PROSPER (n = 27,091, grades 9-12) indicate global embeddedness is generally protective, but for girls, greater global embeddedness when friends are more depressive is associated with increased depressive symptoms. For girls, greater local cohesion reduces associations between more depressive friends and increased depressive levels, while for boys, both local cohesion and friends' depression are largely irrelevant. Results indicate the importance of considering both local and global network integration in tandem with gender and friends' depression to understand how social integration relates to mental health.

<title>The 'friendship dynamics of religion,' or the 'religious dynamics of friendship'? A social network analysis of adolescents who attend small schools</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2012.03.014</url>
<snippet>Longitudinal social network data on adolescents in seven schools are analyzed to reach a new understanding about how the personal and interpersonal social dimensions of adolescent religion intertwine together in small school settings. We primarily address two issues relevant to the sociology of religion and.sociology in general: (1) social selection as a source of religious homophily and (2) friend socialization of religion. Analysis results are consistent with Collins interaction ritual chain theory, which stresses the social dimensions of religion, since network-religion autocorrelations are relatively substantial in magnitude and both selection and socialization mechanisms play key roles in generating them. Results suggest that socialization plays a stronger role than social selection in four of six religious outcomes, and that more religious youth are more cliquish. Implications for our understanding of the social context of religion, religious homophily, and the ways we model religious influence, as well as limitations and considerations for future research, are discussed.

<title>Empirical Models of Social Learning in a Large, Evolving Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0160307</url>
<snippet>This paper advances theories of social learning through an empirical examination of how social networks change over time. Social networks are important for learning because they constrain individuals' access to information about the behaviors and cognitions of other people. Using data on a large social network of mobile device users over a one-month time period, we test three hypotheses: 1) attraction homophily causes individuals to form ties on the basis of attribute similarity, 2) aversion homophily causes individuals to delete existing ties on the basis of attribute dissimilarity, and 3) social influence causes individuals to adopt the attributes of others they share direct ties with. Statistical models offer varied degrees of support for all three hypotheses and show that these mechanisms are more complex than assumed in prior work. Although homophily is normally thought of as a process of attraction, people also avoid relationships with others who are different. These mechanisms have distinct effects on network structure. While social influence does help explain behavior, people tend to follow global trends more than they follow their friends.

<title>A Theoretical Examination of Homophily Beyond Focus Theory: Causes, Consequences, and New Directions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440231173915</url>
<snippet>Scott Feld's focus theory stimulated one of the most important traditions in the study of the concept of homophily in connection to individual action and network behavior across sociology and organizational studies. This article uses Feld's focus theory as a starting point of reference to examine the major theoretical developments and empirical applications of homophily since his pioneering work. First, this article interrogates the causes of homophily by examining structured versus social psychological preference for similarity as two prominent explanatory mechanisms for homophily. Second, this article scopes out the consequences of homophily by examining the advantages and disadvantages of homophily for individual action and network behavior. Finally, building on the previous sections, this article proposes new areas for the study of homophily: deleterious psychosocial consequences of homophily, the role of multiplexity in causing homophily, and the disaggregation of homophily in general into different, nuanced (potentially interacting) types of homophily. This article thus contributes to the literature by offering a critical juncture to examine the key arguments that have guided the study of homophily since Feld's focus theory and an important launching point for future research on the concept of homophily and its applications.

<title>Symmetric core-cohesive blockmodel in preschool children's interaction networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226801</url>
<snippet>Researchers have extensively studied the social mechanisms that drive the formation of networks observed among preschool children. However, less attention has been given to global network structures in terms of blockmodels. A blockmodel is a network where the nodes are groups of equivalent units (according to links to others) from a studied network. It is already shown that mutuality, popularity, assortativity, and different types of transitivity mechanisms can lead the global network structure to the proposed asymmetric core-cohesive blockmodel. Yet, they did not provide any evidence that such a global network structure actually appears in any empirical data. In this paper, the symmetric version of the core-cohesive blockmodel type is proposed. This blockmodel type consists of three or more groups of units. The units from each group are internally well linked to each other while those from different groups are not linked to each other. This is true for all groups, except one in which the units have mutual links to all other units in the network. In this study, it is shown that the proposed blockmodel type appears in empirical interactional networks collected among preschool children. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the most often studied social network mechanisms can lead the global network structure to the proposed symmetric blockmodel type. The units' attributes are not considered in this study.

<title>Patterns of support and conflict relationships in personal networks and perceived stress</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0011392120948926</url>
<snippet>This article investigates the association between personal networks and stress, both positively through support and negatively through conflict. In a representative sample of 755 individuals residing in Switzerland, each individual was asked to name people in their lives who they perceived as very important, as well as to report their mutual support and conflict interactions. First, the article develops and investigates a typology with five relational patterns based on indicators of emotional support and conflict relationships in personal networks. These patterns are the following:bonding social capital,bridging social capital,ego-centered conflict,overload, andambivalent. Second, it explores the association of these patterns with stress levels that are perceived in various life domains. Results show that individuals involved in relationships that were predominantly supportive had lower levels of stress, whereas individuals experiencing relationships characterized by conflict, or an imbalance in support by giving more than receiving, had higher levels of stress. Finally, ambivalent relationships in which support and conflict were equally present were associated with an intermediate level of stress. These results show the importance of considering support and conflict relationships together in personal network structures.

<title>Age integration in the social convoys of young and late midlife adults</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2023.100540</url>
<snippet>Homophily on the basis of age is a notable characteristic of social convoys across the life course. Ties to older and younger persons, therefore, are both unusual and potentially provide unique social support resources. This study examined relationships with older, younger, and same-aged non-kin ties among young and late midlife adults. Data came from the University of California Berkeley Social Networks Study (UCNets), a sample of 485 people aged 21-30 and 674 people aged 50-70. A majority of non-kin ties were to people whose age was within 5 years of the participant's own age, although the majority was much larger for young adults (81 &#37;) than late midlife adults (52 &#37;). Younger and older ties often came from different social settings (school, work, religious organi-zations, and neighborhoods) than same-aged ties, and there were also some cohort differences in the social settings that produced younger, older, and same-aged ties. Younger and older ties also provided different forms of social support than did ties to same-aged persons. Again, the functions of younger and older ties varied by cohort. Implications for life course studies are discussed.

<title>Using Social Network Methods to Test for Assortment of Prosociality among Korean High School Students</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0125333</url>
<snippet>Assortative interaction among altruistic individuals is a necessary condition for the evolution of cooperation. The requirement for assortment holds regardless of whether a meta-population is subdivided into distinct and isolated subgroups or has ephemeral boundaries with a high migration rate. The assumption, however, is rarely tested directly. In this paper, we develop a method to test for assortment of prosociality in network-structured data. The method is applied to a friendship network collected from 238 Korean students attending the same high school. A mixing matrix was used to explore the presence of assortative friendship among more prosocial individuals. An exponential random graph model of network structure that accounts for additional observed relational propensities (higher-than-expected number of people nominating no friends) and sampling constraints (upper bound on friendship nominations) found that individual prosociality predicted friendship propensity, and that individuals with higher prosocial scores had a higher probability of befriending other more prosocial individuals. The results reveal that a considerable level of assortment of prosociality characterizes this population.

<title>Exponential Random Graph Models: Modelling Relational Mechanisms in the Inter-organisational Network of the Czech Coal Subsystem</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.13060/csr.2023.046</url>
<snippet>This study provides the first comprehensive introduction to exponential random graph models (ERGM) in the Czech academic literature. In it we apply ERGM to a network of 68 organisations involved in the Czech coal policy subsystem. First, we summarise the major limitations of the statistical modelling of network data arising from the interdependencies among observations and explain principled solutions to them provided by ERGM. Next, we discuss ERGM's metatheoretical assumptions and their embeddedness within the broader context of social science research. We then introduce three types of relational mechanisms (endogenous, individual, and dyadic) operationalised as specific configurations, which we illustrate through the empirical example of an expert information network. Following a descriptive analysis we apply ERGM, breaking it down into three main steps: simulation, estimation, and estimation assessment. We provide a detailed interpretation of the model's development and results, along with recommendations for building a model and solutions to convergence failure problems. One important finding is that one predictor of the exchange of expert information is ideological homophily, which reduces the potential of expertise to seek compromise solutions. We close with a discussion of the results and ERGM extensions to apply to more complex types of network data such as bipartite and multiplex networks and valued and longitudinal data.

<title>Exploring the role of network diversity and resources in relationship to generalized trust in Norway</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.02.002</url>
<snippet>Several studies suggest a positive relationship between social capital and generalized trust. Employing a network understanding of social capital (Lin, 2001), this study questions which aspects of social networks may be linked with generalized trust. It investigates whether the diversity of social networks and the socio-economic status of one's contacts are linked with generalized trust in the Norwegian, egalitarian context. The analyses examine these patterns in relationship to both kin and non-kin contacts. The study employs data from the first Norwegian survey that includes the position generator (PG). The empirical analyses show that extensive social networks are indeed linked to higher levels of generalized trust, but that this relationship is limited to non-kin contacts. Concerning the link between network resources and generalized trust, there is evidence of a more general association with generalized trust that holds when considering both kin and non-kin contacts. These results are a first step in developing a more nuanced discussion of the mechanisms associated with generalized trust and highlight the importance of employing measures that account for the homophily of networks when investigating their relationship to trust.

<snippet>This study explores the mechanisms by which online social information seeking (i.e., monitoring Facebook friends) relates to social capital. Based on the extant literature, we propose a theoretical framework that includes communication activities across different channels operationalized as offline participation, network structure on social network site operationalized as the number of actual online friends and network diversity, and self-esteem. Results from an online survey (N = 223) found a moderated mediation model in which participation in offline social activities mediated the relationship between social information seeking and self-reported bonding social capital, and self-esteem moderated this mediation. In addition, participation in offline social activities provided an additional channel to accessing bridging social capital. These results provide a theoretical framework for and suggest an approach of communication multiplexity to future research.

<title>No evidence for a relationship between social closeness and similarity in resting-state functional brain connectivity in schoolchildren</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-67718-8</url>
<snippet>Previous research suggests that the proximity of individuals in a social network predicts how similarly their brains respond to naturalistic stimuli. However, the relationship between social connectedness and brain connectivity in the absence of external stimuli has not been examined. To investigate whether neural homophily between friends exists at rest we collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 68 school-aged girls, along with social network information from all pupils in their year groups (total 5,066 social dyads). Participants were asked to rate the amount of time they voluntarily spent with each person in their year group, and directed social network matrices and community structure were then determined from these data. No statistically significant relationships between social distance, community homogeneity and similarity of global-level resting-state connectivity were observed. Nor were we able to predict social distance using a regularised regression technique (i.e. elastic net regression based on the local-level similarities in resting-state whole-brain connectivity between participants). Although neural homophily between friends exists when viewing naturalistic stimuli, this finding did not extend to functional connectivity at rest in our population. Instead, resting-state connectivity may be less susceptible to the influences of a person's social environment.

<title>Homophily in the Guise of Cross-Linking: Political Blogs and Content</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764214527090</url>
<snippet>This study examines the behavior of influential political blogs (conservative and liberal) in reference to external viral content during March 2007 and June 2009. We analyze homophily and cross-ideological (heterophily) practices. We propose a multidimensional model that employs both qualitative and quantitative methods for examining homophily behaviors by looking at three dimensions: blog-to-blog, blog-tovideo, blog post-to-video. Findings show that while homophily patterns prevail, some limited occurrences of cross-ideological practices exist. The cross-linking practices may include deliberative motives, but in essence they are not created for the purposes of discourse. Instead, these cross-linking practices strengthen previously held political stances of the users who create them and negatively portray and reframe content of alternative views. This represents homophily in the guise of cross-linking.

<title>Should I use my 'weak' social capital or 'strong' &lt;i&gt;guanxi&lt;/i&gt;? Reviewing and critiquing two theories in the context of Western-Chinese migration</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1440783320925152</url>
<snippet>Social network dynamics are complex in the context of Chinese overseas migration because of the unique dynamics of guanxi, which are distinctly different from 'Western' social capital. The few migration studies comparing guanxi and social capital suggest that the former largely consists 'strong ties', while the latter is comprised of 'weak ties'. However, most apply only a cursory comparison of one network facet. We review core literature in the two fields to contrast what each says about network norms, structures and practices. We find that: (i) guanxi is characterised by dynamics of 'face' and renqing; (ii) guanxi has core and peripheral aspects that grant it bonding and bridging qualities; (iii) weak ties in social capital networks are more beneficial for acquiring non-redundant resources, and for joining civic/voluntary associations; (iv) while strong, face-based guanxi ties better mobilise valuable resources, these ties are rarely transformed into social capital.

<title>Nonreligious Group Factors Versus Religious Belief in the Prediction of Prosociality</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-014-0700-0</url>
<snippet>Previous research has suggested that religious belief is associated with a range of prosocial behaviors such as social embeddedness and generosity. However, this literature has often conflated belief in God with group involvement and failed to control for demographic and social network effects. Rather than assessing prosociality by comparing religious group members with the unaffiliated, the present study also includes secular/nonreligious group members. Multiple regression analyses controlling for confounds diminishes many of the apparent differences between religious and nonreligious individuals. Belief in God itself accounts for approximately 1-2 &#37; of the variance in social embeddedness domains and &lt; 1 &#37; of the variance in the domains of outside-group charity and community volunteering. Belief in God is associated with homophily and parochial behavior such as within-group charitable donations and constrained contact with different others. These findings indicate that prosocial benefits are more related to general group membership equally available to religious and secular group members alike than they are to specifically religious content. Religious beliefs are related to within-group prosociality as well as homophily and parochialism directed to those outside the group.

<title>Social selection and peer influence in an online social network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1109739109</url>
<snippet>Disentangling the effects of selection and influence is one of social science's greatest unsolved puzzles: Do people befriend others who are similar to them, or do they become more similar to their friends over time? Recent advances in stochastic actor-based modeling, combined with self-reported data on a popular online social network site, allow us to address this question with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore been possible. Using data on the Facebook activity of a cohort of college students over 4 years, we find that students who share certain tastes in music and in movies, but not in books, are significantly likely to befriend one another. Meanwhile, we find little evidence for the diffusion of tastes among Facebook friends-except for tastes in classical/jazz music. These findings shed light on the mechanisms responsible for observed network homogeneity; provide a statistically rigorous assessment of the coevolution of cultural tastes and social relationships; and suggest important qualifications to our understanding of both homophily and contagion as generic social processes.

<title>Social Network Analysis of Nonprofits in Disaster Response: The Case of Twitter During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393221130674</url>
<snippet>The COVID-19 pandemic has created complex problems that require organizations to collaborate within and across the sector line. Social media data can provide insights into how nonprofits interact for the pandemic response from both social network and geographical perspectives. This study innovatively investigated the connection and interaction patterns among 74 National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD) nonprofits and three government agencies based on structural analyses and content analyses of their Twitter communications during the long-term global COVID-19 pandemic. The daily tweeting quantities of all nonprofits were generally consistent with the pandemic severity in the United States before July 2020 and remained stable afterward. Nonprofits' tweets can reflect their purposes of sharing information, building communities, and taking actions for disaster response. Government agencies played leadership roles in providing COVID-19 guidelines and information. Human services, International and Foreign Affairs, and Public and Societal Benefit nonprofits, especially American Red Cross played central roles in the nonprofit communication network. Possible explanations include the following: (1) Geographically, connections and interactions among nonprofits are more likely to happen within the same city or in neighboring states. (2) Both mission homophily and heterophily contribute to connections and interactions among nonprofits, depending on their subsectors. The findings not only help the public better understand how nonprofits are collaboratively fighting the pandemic, but also provide guidance for nonprofits to plan for better interactions and communications in future disaster response.

<title>From network ties to network structures: Exponential Random Graph Models of interorganizational relations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-011-9619-6</url>
<snippet>Theoretical accounts of network ties between organizations emphasize the interdependence of individual intentions, opportunities, and actions embedded in local configurations of network ties. These accounts are at odds with empirical models based on assumptions of independence between network ties. As a result, the relation between models for network ties and the observed network structure of interorganizational fields is problematic. Using original fieldwork and data that we have collected on collaborative network ties within a regional community of hospital organizations we estimate newly developed specifications of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) that help to narrow the gap between theories and empirical models of interorganizational networks. After controlling for the main factors known to affect partner selection decisions, full models in which local dependencies between network ties are appropriately specified outperform restricted models in which such dependencies are left unspecified and only controlled for statistically. We use computational methods to show that networks based on empirical estimates produced by models accounting for local network dependencies reproduce with accuracy salient features of the global network structure that was actually observed. We show that models based on assumptions of independence between network ties do not. The results of the study suggest that mechanisms behind the formation of network ties between organizations are local, but their specification and identification depends on an accurate characterization of network structure. We discuss the implications of this view for current research on interorganizational networks, communities, and fields.

<title>Network Evolution and Social Situations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.15195/v5.a18</url>
<snippet>Studying the evolution of friendship networks has a long tradition in sociology. Multiple micromechanisms underlying friendship formation have been discovered, the most pervasive being reciprocity, transitivity, and homophily. Although each mechanism is studied in depth on its own, their relation to one another is rarely analyzed, and a theoretical framework that integrates research on all of them does not exist. This article introduces a friendship evolution model, which proposes that each micromechanism is related to interactions in different social situations. Based on this model, decreasing returns to embedding in multiple mechanisms are hypothesized. Complete social network data of adolescents and statistical network models are used to test these hypotheses. Results show a consistently negative interaction in line with the formulated model. The consequences of this negative relation between the network evolution mechanisms are explored in a simulation study, which suggests that this is a strong determinant of network-level integration and segregation.

<title>How social learning amplifies moral outrage expression in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abe5641</url>
<snippet>Moral outrage shapes fundamental aspects of social life and is now widespread in online social networks. Here, we show how social learning processes amplify online moral outrage expressions over time. In two preregistered observational studies on Twitter (7331 users and 12.7 million total tweets) and two preregistered behavioral experiments (N = 240), we find that positive social feedback for outrage expressions increases the likelihood of future outrage expressions, consistent with principles of reinforcement learning. In addition, users conform their outrage expressions to the expressive norms of their social networks, suggesting norm learning also guides online outrage expressions. Norm learning overshadows reinforcement learning when normative information is readily observable: in ideologically extreme networks, where outrage expression is more common, users are less sensitive to social feedback when deciding whether to express outrage. Our findings highlight how platform design interacts with human learning mechanisms to affect moral discourse in digital public spaces.

<title>Segregation in Civic Life: Ethnic Sorting and Mixing across Voluntary Associations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122416651312</url>
<snippet>To what extent do voluntary organizations like sports, leisure, and neighborhood associations provide a platform where ethnic groups mingle and ethnic boundaries are overcome? This study uses unique panel data from the Netherlands Longitudinal Life Course Study (NELLS) to shed light on the integrative power of voluntary associations. I investigate decisions to join and leave associations of different ethnic composition, as a member or a volunteer, among individuals of Turkish, Moroccan, and native Dutch origin. In general, all ethnic groups are equally likely to join voluntary organizations, but ethnic minorities are more likely to leave than are Dutch natives, even after accounting for relevant sociodemographic characteristics. This alone explains ethnic minorities' lower involvement rates. Moreover, joining decisions are characterized by strong ethnic sorting across organizations of different ethnic composition: people are much more likely to join associations containing fewer ethnic out-group members. This limits the potential of voluntary associations as pathways to social integration. In contrast, once the initial hurdle of getting involved has been taken, people are no more likely to disengage from organizations with more ethnic out-group members. Inter-ethnic neighborhood contact and the local supply of involvement opportunities are most influential in explaining the strong sorting tendencies in people's joining decisions.

<title>Cultural Holes: Beyond Relationality in Social Networks and Culture</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102615</url>
<snippet>A burgeoning literature spanning sociologies of culture and social network methods has for the past several decades sought to explicate the relationships between culture and connectivity. A number of promising recent moves toward integration are worthy of review, comparison, critique, and synthesis. Network thinking provides powerful techniques for specifying cultural concepts ranging from narrative networks to classification systems, tastes, and cultural repertoires. At the same time, we see theoretical advances by sociologists of culture as providing a corrective to network analysis as it is often portrayed, as a mere collection of methods. Cultural thinking complements and sets a new agenda for moving beyond predominant forms of structural analysis that ignore action, agency, and intersubjective meaning. The notion of "cultural holes" that we use to organize our review points both to the cultural contingency of network structure and to the increasingly permeable boundary between studies of culture and research on social networks.

<title>The dual network structure of organizational problem solving: A case study on open source software development</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2012.12.003</url>
<snippet>We reconstruct the dual network structure generated by the association between 72 contributors and 737 software bugs engaged during a full development cycle of the free/open source software project Epiphany. Estimates of structural parameters of Exponential Random Graph Models for two-mode networks reveal the structural logics shaping activities of collaborative problem solving. After controlling for contributor-specific and software bug-specific characteristics, we find that contributors ("problem solvers") tend to distribute their activity over multiple software bugs. At the same time, however, we find that software bugs ("problems") tend not to share multiple contributors. This dual tendency toward de-specialization and exclusivity is sustained by specific local network dependencies revealed by our analysis which also suggests possible organizational mechanisms that may be underlying the puzzling macro-structural regularities frequently observed, but rarely explained, in the production of open source software. By combining these mechanisms with the influence of contributors characterized by different levels of involvement in the project, we provide micro-level evidence of structural interdependence between "core" and "peripheral" members identified exclusively on the basis of their individual level of contribution to the project.

<title>Closure, connectivity and degree distributions: Exponential random graph (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;*) models for directed social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2008.10.006</url>
<snippet>The new higher order specifications for exponential random graph models introduced by Snijders et al. [Snijders,T.A.B., Rattison, RE., Robins G.L., Handcock. M., 2006. New specifications for exponential random graph models. Sociological Methodology 36,99-153] exhibit substantial improvements in model fit compared with the commonly used Markov random graph models. Snijders et al., however, concentrated on non-directed graphs, with only limited extensions to directed graphs. In particular, they presented a transitive closure parameter based on path shortening. In this paper, we explain the theoretical and empirical advantages in generalizing to additional closure effects. We propose three new triadic-based parameters to represent different versions of triadic closure: cyclic effects; transitivity based on shared choices of partners; and transitivity based on shared popularity. We interpret the last two effects as forms of structural homophily, where ties emerge because nodes share a form of localized structural equivalence. We show that, for some datasets, the path shortening parameter is insufficient for practical modeling, whereas the structural homophily parameters can produce useful models with distinctive interpretations. We also introduce corresponding lower order effects for multiple two-path connectivity. We show by example that the in- and out-degree distributions may be better modeled when star-based parameters are supplemented with parameters for the number of isolated nodes, sources (nodes with zero in-degrees) and sinks (nodes with zero out-degrees). Inclusion of a Markov mixed star parameter may also help model the correlation between in- and out-degrees. We select some 50 graph features to be investigated in goodness of fit diagnostics, covering a variety of important network properties including density, reciprocity, geodesic distributions, degree distributions, and various forms of closure. As empirical illustrations, we develop models for two sets of organizational network data: a trust network within a training group, and a work difficulty network within a government instrumentality.

<title>Categorical closure: Transitivity and identities in longitudinal networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2024.06.004</url>
<snippet>This research examines whether categorical closure - an increased tendency for closure in homogeneous triads - matters for tie formation and tie persistence. We utilized 2019-2020 panel data on students' networks at three law schools and employed separable temporal exponential random graph models to examine whether closed triads with shared identities were more likely to form and to persist over time. We also investigated whether closed triads based on shared organizational assignments were associated with lower likelihoods of tie formation and tie persistence over time. Results supported the notion that law students were more likely to form homogeneous closed triads based on shared categories, particularly family background, gender, and race, while closed triads based on organizational assignments were less likely. Closed triads tended to persist over time, but there was some support for the notion that homogeneous closed triads based on family background, college rank, and sexuality were more durable. This study highlights categorical closure as an additional network mechanism giving rise to homogenous groups.

<title>World Environment Day: Understanding Environmental Programs Impact on Society Using Twitter Data Mining</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-022-02957-y</url>
<snippet>Environmental sustainability awareness has encouraged the promotion of a number of environmental programs and initiatives and, accordingly, the use of social networks for the dissemination and support of these initiatives has grown significantly. Thus, the purpose of the work is to understand United Nations World Environment Day (WED) programs impact on the digital public debate using Twitter data mining. For that, an ad hoc methodology is designed to provide it to authorities and organizations that wish to analyze the impact of different initiatives or programs on society. All in all, the research carried out analyzes more than 400,000 tweets sent during the 2021 edition of the WED. The tweets have been processed using Big Data techniques and Social Network Analysis. The research reveals that the WED was a trending topic initiative that was discussed in positive terms, where collective sentiment was shown. The topics covered dealt with the event day and the different initiatives related to restoration of ecosystems. However, it is noted that: there is no coordinated action by the institutions, groups or individuals involved in the conversation and the initiative tends towards homophily; digital mobilization is mostly centered in the host country (Pakistan) and, above all, in the neighboring country (India) and, the conspicuous absence of the business sphere in the discussion.

<title>Exponential random graph models for multilevel networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2013.01.004</url>
<snippet>Modern multilevel analysis, whereby outcomes of individuals within groups take into account group membership, has been accompanied by impressive theoretical development (e.g. Kozlowski and Klein, 2000) and sophisticated methodology (e.g. Snijders and Bosker, 2012). But typically the approach assumes that links between groups are non-existent, and interdependence among the individuals derives solely from common group membership. It is not plausible that such groups have no internal structure nor they have no links between each other. Networks provide a more complex representation of interdependence. Drawing on a small but crucial body of existing work, we present a general formulation of a multilevel network structure. We extend exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to multilevel networks, and investigate the properties of the proposed models using simulations which show that even very simple meso effects can create structure at one or both levels. We use an empirical example of a collaboration network about French cancer research elites and their affiliations (Lazega et al., 2006, 2008) to demonstrate that a full understanding of the network structure requires the cross-level parameters. We see these as the first steps in a full elaboration for general multilevel network analysis using ERGMs.

These were modeled using multivariate cross-sectional (statistical) network models. Exponential random graph models for a sample of 18 classrooms, numbering 393 students, were summarized using meta-analyses. Results showed (balanced) network structures with positive ties between those who were structurally equivalent in the negative network. Moreover, essential structural parameters for the univariate network structure of positive (general like) and negative (general dislike and bullying) tie networks were identified. Different structures emerged in positive and negative networks. The results provide a starting point for further theoretical and (multiplex) empirical research about negative ties and their interplay with positive ties.

<title>On the validity of perceived social structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2020.102384</url>
<snippet>The validity of survey-based reports of social relationships is a critical assumption for much social network research. Research on informant accuracy has shown that observational data and recalled behavior by informants are imperfectly correlated, which calls into question whether complex relations like friendship and advice-seeking can be accurately measured from individual reports. A class of network inference models, the Bayesian Network Accuracy Models, growing out of the pioneering work of Batchelder and Romney on inference from informant reports, provides a principled basis for inferring network structure given such error-prone data. Using these models, we can gain insight into the accuracy of informants' self and proxy reports of social ties, and more broadly, the reliability and validity of respondents' reports of informal social relations. While existing data does not provide a criterion validity check for inferring most relationships, other notions of validity and/or reliability can still be applied. For instance, if friendship reports are generated from a common underlying network that is perceivable (albeit imperfectly) by all actors, then random subsets of actors should produce estimates that should agree (i.e., split-half reliability). Using informant reports on friendship and advice-seeking networks from four different organizations, we show substantially higher levels of split-half reliability than can be explained by chance, suggesting that models are indeed estimating a common underlying relation. We also show that informants' errors appear to be structured in ways that are consistent with cognitive models of social perception, with greater accuracy on average for large-scale network features rather than fine details, for own versus others' ties, and for core-periphery structures versus bipartitions. Evidence from construct validity checks further suggests the that common networks underlying informants' reports have properties that would be expected of true social structures. Taken together, our findings support the view that informants' mental models of social structure, while error-prone, nevertheless reflect an underlying social reality.

<title>LOGISTIC NETWORK REGRESSION FOR SCALABLE ANALYSIS OF NETWORKS WITH JOINT EDGE/VERTEX DYNAMICS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0081175013520159</url>
<snippet>Change in group size and composition has long been an important area of research in the social sciences. Similarly, interest in interaction dynamics has a long history in sociology and social psychology. However, the effects of endogenous group change on interaction dynamics are a surprisingly understudied area. One way to explore these relationships is through social network models. Network dynamics may be viewed as a process of change in the edge structure of a network, in the vertex set on which edges are defined, or in both simultaneously. Although early studies of such processes were primarily descriptive, recent work on this topic has increasingly turned to formal statistical models. Although showing great promise, many of these modern dynamic models are computationally intensive and scale very poorly in the size of the network under study and/or the number of time points considered. Likewise, currently used models focus on edge dynamics, with little support for endogenously changing vertex sets. Here, the authors show how an existing approach based on logistic network regression can be extended to serve as a highly scalable framework for modeling large networks with dynamic vertex sets. The authors place this approach within a general dynamic exponential family (exponential-family random graph modeling) context, clarifying the assumptions underlying the framework (and providing a clear path for extensions), and they show how model assessment methods for cross-sectional networks can be extended to the dynamic case. Finally, the authors illustrate this approach on a classic data set involving interactions among windsurfers on a California beach.

<title>Social learning and partisan bias in the interpretation of climate trends</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1722664115</url>
<snippet>Vital scientific communications are frequently misinterpreted by the lay public as a result of motivated reasoning, where people misconstrue data to fit their political and psychological biases. In the case of climate change, some people have been found to systematically misinterpret climate data in ways that conflict with the intended message of climate scientists. While prior studies have attempted to reduce motivated reasoning through bipartisan communication networks, these networks have also been found to exacerbate bias. Popular theories hold that bipartisan networks amplify bias by exposing people to opposing beliefs. These theories are in tension with collective intelligence research, which shows that exchanging beliefs in social networks can facilitate social learning, thereby improving individual and group judgments. However, prior experiments in collective intelligence have relied almost exclusively on neutral questions that do not engage motivated reasoning. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we conducted an online experiment to test how bipartisan social networks can influence subjects' interpretation of climate communications from NASA. Here, we show that exposure to opposing beliefs in structured bipartisan social networks substantially improved the accuracy of judgments among both conservatives and liberals, eliminating belief polarization. However, we also find that social learning can be reduced, and belief polarization maintained, as a result of partisan priming. We find that increasing the salience of partisanship during communication, both through exposure to the logos of political parties and through exposure to the political identities of network peers, can significantly reduce social learning.

<title>Network creation with homophilic agents</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00355-024-01562-x</url>
<snippet>Network Creation Games are an important framework for understanding the formation of real-world networks. These games usually assume a set of indistinguishable agents strategically buying edges at a uniform price, which leads to the formation of a network among them. However, in real life, agents are heterogeneous and their relationships often display a bias towards similar agents, say of the same ethnic group. This homophilic behavior on the agent level can then lead to the emergent global phenomenon of social segregation. We study Network Creation Games with multiple types of homophilic agents and non-uniform edge cost, introducing two models focusing on the perception of same-type and different-type neighbors, respectively. Despite their different initial conditions, both our theoretical and experimental analysis show that both the composition and segregation strength of the resulting stable networks are very similar, indicating a robust structure of social networks under homophily.

<title>Digital Communication and Work-Life Supportive Supervisor Behaviors in Europe</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/si.v11i4.7084</url>
<snippet>The spread of digital communication in the employee-supervisor exchange relation has increased the risks of blurred boundaries between life domains and, subsequently, the need for work-life supportive supervisor behaviors (WLSSB). However, media richness and social presence theory indicate that WLSSB is simultaneously at risk because close bonds with supervisors are more difficult to develop and challenges in integrating work and personal life are more difficult to be signaled and understood. Following social network theory in the argument that it is not only the characteristic of the medium that is of importance but also the social embeddedness of its use, this research asks to what extent the association of digital communication with one's supervisor and perceived WLSSB is context-dependent. The overall results based on the European Social Survey (round 10) reveal that in-person communication is more strongly associated with WLSSB than digital communication. However, more nuanced investigations suggest that this is not necessarily driven by the richness of the mode of communication. We find that the meaning of digital communication with one's supervisor gains importance in size and significance (a) where it complements seldom in-person communication, (b) where the organizational norm of high work devotion is weak, and

<title>Cultural Resources and Mobilization of Social Capital: The Case of Finding a Job</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/soin.12500</url>
<snippet>By combining the latest knowledge from cultural sociology and social network theories, a hypothesis is posed regarding the association between cultural consumption and social capital mobilization. On the classic example of looking for work, an assumption was made that persons who prefer or engage in a larger number of cultural forms (the so-called omnivores) have greater chances to find work through social contacts than through any other methods or may count on social support when looking for job, and this relationship is stronger for non-family than for family ties. These arguments are tested with the use of survey data collected in Poland in 2017 on a locally representative sample of adult residents aged 18-75. The results support the hypotheses and additionally show that people with different cultural profiles differ in their capacity to access and mobilize social resources. While participation in both highbrow and popular culture is efficacious, not all forms of the popular one are positively related to social resources. The article is closed with some concluding remarks, limitations of the study, and guidelines for future research.

<title>Lay theories of networking ability: Beliefs that inhibit instrumental networking</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2020.01.003</url>
<snippet>While touting the importance of building effective networks, scholars have paid far less attention to why so many people feel so ambivalent or conflicted about instrumental networking, and what can be done to change such attitudes. The present research provides the first empirical test of a novel theory, which argues that people are more likely to disengage from networking if they hold a "fixed theory" of networking ability-believing that how well one networks is fixed or innate rather than learned through effort-which triggers negative attitudes toward moral and instrumental aspects of networking. To test this argument, we first develop and validate a Lay Theory of Networking Ability scale (Study 1) and show that this scale predicts people's attendance in networking events over a 6-week period (Study 2). Next, we show that lay theories can be experimentally manipulated, with consequences for attendance in networking events over a 4-week period (Study 3) as well as people's affective experiences in networking events (Study 4). In all, the present research contributes to our understanding of the motivational psychology of networking by highlighting the importance of beliefs as an understudied construct in the networks literature and by introducing methods to measure and manipulate them.

<title>Binational Social Networks and Assimilation: A Test of the Importance of Transnationalism</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/sp.2014.12192</url>
<snippet>While the concept of transnationalism has gained widespread popularity among scholars as a way to describe immigrants' long-term maintenance of cross-border ties to their origin communities, critics have argued that the overall proportion of immigrants who engage in transnational behavior is low and that, as a result, transnationalism has little sustained effect on the process of immigrant adaptation and assimilation. In this article, we argue that a key shortcoming in the current empirical debate on transnationalism is the lack of data on the social networks that connect migrants to each other and to nonmigrants in communities of origin. To address this shortcoming, our analysis uses unique binational data on the social network connecting an immigrant sending community in Guanajuato, Mexico, to two destination areas in the United States. We test for the effect of respondents' positions in cross-border networks on their migration intentions and attitudes towards the United States using data on the opinions of their peers, their participation in cross-border and local communication networks, and their structural position in the network. The results indicate qualified empirical support for a network-based model of transnationalism; in the U.S. sample we find evidence of network clustering consistent with peer effects, while in the Mexican sample we find evidence of the importance of cross-border communication with friends.

The possibility to look beyond dyadic interactions by considering whole networks of social relationships allows researchers the opportunity to study social groups in more natural ways. As such, network-based analyses provide an informative way to investigate the factors influencing the social environment of group-living animals, and so has direct application to animal welfare. For example, animal groups in captivity are frequently disrupted by separations, reintroductions and/or mixing with unfamiliar individuals and this can lead to social stress and associated aggression. Social network analysis of animal groups can help identify the underlying causes of these socially-derived animal welfare concerns. In this review we discuss how this approach can be applied, and how it could be used to identify potential interventions and solutions in the area of animal welfare.

<title>Homophily in Adolescence: Is Similarity in Status Characteristics Associated with Similarity in Anti-school Behaviour?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1103308814557400</url>
<snippet>This study asks to what extent similarity in status characteristics (gender and ethnicity) is linked with similarity in anti-school behaviour. We argue that the social forces responsible for homophily-based selection are also at work with regard to homophily-based influence. We use data from the Flemish Educational Assessment Study, which collected complete network data from a representative sample of Flemish secondary school adolescents (N = 11,872). Results indicate that similarity on gender and ethnicity is linked with similarity on behavioural characteristics. Furthermore, the association between status homophily and behavioural homophily is stronger for boys than girls. For minorities, status heterophily on ethnicity is associated with behavioural heterophily, which may be an indication that minority students distance themselves from their majority-group friends.

<title>Seed exchange networks, ethnicity, and sorghum diversity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1513238112</url>
<snippet>Recent studies investigating the relationship between crop genetic diversity and human cultural diversity patterns showed that seed exchanges are embedded in farmers' social organization. However, our understanding of the social processes involved remains limited. We investigated how farmers' membership in three major social groups interacts in shaping sorghum seed exchange networks in a cultural contact zone on Mount Kenya. Farmers are members of residence groups at the local scale and of dialect groups clustered within larger ethnolinguistic units at a wider scale. The Chuka and Tharaka, who are allied in the same ethnolinguistic unit, coexist with the Mbeere dialect group in the study area. We assessed farmers' homophily, propensity to exchange seeds with members of the same group, using exponential random graph models. We showed that homophily is significant within both residence and ethnolinguistic groups. At these two levels, homophily is driven by the kinship system, particularly by the combination of patrilocal residence and ethnolinguistic endogamy, because most seeds are exchanged among relatives. Indeed, residential homophily in seed exchanges results from local interactions between women and their in-law family, whereas at a higher level, ethnolinguistic homophily is driven by marriage endogamy. Seed exchanges and marriage ties are interrelated, and both are limited between the Mbeere and the other groups, although frequent between the Chuka and Tharaka. The impact of these social homophily processes on crop diversity is discussed.

<title>Exposure to opposing views on social media can increase political polarization</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1804840115</url>
<snippet>There is mounting concern that social media sites contribute to political polarization by creating "echo chambers" that insulate people from opposing views about current events. We surveyed a large sample of Democrats and Republicans who visit Twitter at least three times each week about a range of social policy issues. One week later, we randomly assigned respondents to a treatment condition in which they were offered financial incentives to follow a Twitter bot for 1 month that exposed them to messages from those with opposing political ideologies (e.g., elected officials, opinion leaders, media organizations, and nonprofit groups). Respondents were resurveyed at the end of the month to measure the effect of this treatment, and at regular intervals throughout the study period to monitor treatment compliance. We find that Republicans who followed a liberal Twitter bot became substantially more conservative posttreatment. Democrats exhibited slight increases in liberal attitudes after following a conservative Twitter bot, although these effects are not statistically significant. Notwithstanding important limitations of our study, these findings have significant implications for the interdisciplinary literature on political polarization and the emerging field of computational social science.

<title>Networks and geography: Modelling community network structures as the outcome of both spatial and network processes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2010.12.001</url>
<snippet>This paper focuses on how to extend the exponential random graph models to take into account the geographical embeddedness of individuals in modelling social networks. We develop a hierarchical set of nested models for spatially embedded social networks, in which, following Butts (2002), an interaction function between tie probability and Euclidean distance between nodes is introduced. The models are illustrated by an empirical example from a study of the role of social networks in understanding spatial clustering in unemployment in Australia. The analysis suggests that a spatial effect cannot solely explain the emergence of organised network structure and it is necessary to include both spatial and endogenous network effects in the model.

<title>Reciprocity, transitivity, and skew: Comparing local structure in 40 positive and negative social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267886</url>
<snippet>While most social network research focuses on positive relational ties, such as friendship and information exchange, scholars are beginning to examine the dark side of human interaction, where negative connections represent different forms of interpersonal conflict, intolerance, and abuse. Despite this recent work, the extent to which positive and negative social network structure differs remains unclear. The current project considers whether a network's small-scale, structural patterns of reciprocity, transitivity, and skew, or its "structural signature," can distinguish positive versus negative links. Using exponential random graph models (ERGMs), we examine these differences across a sample of twenty distinct, negative networks and generate comparisons with a related set of twenty positive graphs. Relational ties represent multiple types of interaction such as like versus dislike in groups of adults, friendship versus cyberaggression among adolescents, and agreements versus disputes in online interaction. We find that both positive and negative networks contain more reciprocated dyads than expected by random chance. At the same time, patterns of transitivity define positive but not negative graphs, and negative networks tend to exhibit heavily skewed degree distributions. Given the unique structural signatures of many negative graphs, our results highlight the need for further theoretical and empirical research on the patterns of harmful interaction.

<title>The Rise of Fashion Informatics: A Case of Data-Mining-Based Social Network Analysis in Fashion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0887302X18821187</url>
<snippet>With the advent of modern cognitive computing technologies, fashion informatics researchers contribute to the academic and professional discussion about how a large-scale data set is able to reshape the fashion industry. Data-mining-based social network analysis is a promising area of fashion informatics to investigate relations and information flow among fashion units. By adopting this pragmatic approach, we provide dynamic network visualizations of the case of Paris Fashion Week. Three time periods were researched to monitor the formulation and mobilization of social media users' discussions of the event. Initial textual data on social media were crawled, converted, calculated, and visualized by Python and Gephi. The most influential nodes (hashtags) that function as junctions and the distinct hashtag communities were identified and represented visually as graphs. The relations between the contextual clusters and the role of junctions in linking these clusters were investigated and interpreted.

<title>A Bad Barrel Spoils a Good Apple: How Uncertainty and Networks Affect Whether Matching Rules Can Foster Cooperation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4754</url>
<snippet>Meritocratic matching solves the problem of cooperation by ensuring that only prosocial agents group together while excluding proselfs who are less inclined to cooperate. However, matching is less effective when estimations of individual merit rely on group-level outcomes. Prosocials in uncooperative groups are unable to change the nature of the group and are themselves forced to defect to avoid exploitation. They are then indistinguishable from proselfs, preventing them from accessing cooperative groups. We investigate informal social networks as a potential solution. Interactions in dyadic network relations provide signals of individual cooperativeness which are easier to interpret. Network relations can thus help prosocials to escape from uncooperative groups. To test our intuitions, we develop an ABM modeling cooperative behavior based on a stochastic learning model with adaptive thresholds. We investigate both randomly and homophilously formed networks. We find that homophilous networks create conditions under which meritocratic matching can function as intended. Simulation experiments identify two underlying reasons. First, dyadic network interactions in homophilous networks differentiate more between prosocials and proselfs. Second, homophilous networks create groups of prosocial agents who are aware of each other's behavior. The stronger this prosociality segregation is, the more easily prosocials cooperate in the group context. Further analyses also highlight a downside of homophilous networks. When prosocials successfully escape from uncooperative groups, noncooperatives have fewer encounters with prosocials, diminishing their chances to learn to cooperate through those encounters.

<title>Career mobility and job flocking</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2005.01.002</url>
<snippet>Flocking is oftentimes used to metaphorically describe social behavior. Do people actually flock in a way that avian species do? This paper develops a purely ecological mechanism for explaining similarity in human behavior by distinguishing between social networks of person-to-person ties and ecological networks of ties of observability. I test the "information center hypothesis" [Ibis 115 (1973) 517] from bioecology on the career mobility of professional managers who all graduated from the same university. In this case, spatial proximity in birds is replaced with sociodemographic homophily on an acquired status characteristic among persons. The results indicate that homophilous individuals exchange information about a favorable destination state by ecological ties of observability, that is, they follow the career mobility of fellow alumni and "flock" along with them.

<title>A behavior genetic analysis of the tendency for youth to associate according to GPA</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.01.001</url>
<snippet>Behavior genetic research has revealed that many "environmental" variables are partially influenced by genetic factors. Known as gene-environment correlation (rGE), this line of scholarship provides insight on how and why individuals select into certain environments. Juxtaposing this body of evidence with research on peer group homophily-the tendency for peers to resemble one another on certain traits such as academic ability-raised two research hypotheses: (1) youth will associate with peers who receive grades similar to themselves (i.e., homophily for GPA); and (2) a portion of the variance in peer group GPA (i.e., the peer network average GPA) will be explained by individuals' genetic self-selection into the peer group (rGE). The results supported both hypotheses by showing a strong predictive relationship between the target individual's GPA and that of his/her peers and by revealing that 72&#37; of the variance in peer group GPA was explained by genetic influences.

<title>Wild animals suppress the spread of socially transmitted misinformation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2215428120</url>
<snippet>Understanding the mechanisms by which information and misinformation spread through groups of individual actors is essential to the prediction of phenomena ranging from coordinated group behaviors to misinformation epidemics. Transmission of information through groups depends on the rules that individuals use to transform the perceived actions of others into their own behaviors. Because it is often not possible to directly infer decision-making strategies in situ, most studies of behavioral spread assume that individuals make decisions by pooling or averaging the actions or behavioral states of neighbors. However, whether individuals may instead adopt more sophisticated strategies that exploit socially transmitted information, while remaining robust to misinformation, is unknown. Here, we study the relationship between individual decision-making and misinformation spread in groups of wild coral reef fish, where misinformation occurs in the form of false alarms that can spread contagiously through groups. Using automated visual field reconstruction of wild animals, we infer the precise sequences of socially transmitted visual stimuli perceived by individuals during decision-making. Our analysis reveals a feature of decision-making essential for controlling misinformation spread: dynamic adjustments in sensitivity to socially transmitted cues. This form of dynamic gain control can be achieved by a simple and biologically widespread decision-making circuit, and it renders individual behavior robust to natural fluctuations in misinformation exposure.

<title>Formation of raiding parties for intergroup violence is mediated by social network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1610961113</url>
<snippet>Intergroup violence is common among humans worldwide. To assess how within-group social dynamics contribute to risky, between-group conflict, we conducted a 3-y longitudinal study of the formation of raiding parties among the Nyangatom, a group of East African nomadic pastoralists currently engaged in small-scale warfare. We also mapped the social network structure of potential male raiders. Here, we show that the initiation of raids depends on the presence of specific leaders who tend to participate in many raids, to have more friends, and to occupy more central positions in the network. However, despite the different structural position of raid leaders, raid participants are recruited from the whole population, not just from the direct friends of leaders. An individual's decision to participate in a raid is strongly associated with the individual's social network position in relation to other participants. Moreover, non-leaders have a larger total impact on raid participation than leaders, despite leaders' greater connectivity. Thus, we find that leaders matter more for raid initiation than participant mobilization. Social networks may play a role in supporting risky collective action, amplify the emergence of raiding parties, and hence facilitate intergroup violence in small-scale societies.

<title>Can Cultural Worldviews Influence Network Composition?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Most sociological research assumes that social network composition shapes individual beliefs. Network theory and research has not adequately considered that internalized cultural worldviews might affect network composition. Drawing on a synthetic, dual-process theory of culture and two waves of nationally-representative panel data, this article shows that worldviews are strong predictors of changes in network composition among U.S. youth. These effects arc robust to the influence of other structural factors, including prior network composition and behavioral homophily. By contrast, there is little evidence that networks play a strong proximate role in shaping worldviews. This suggests that internalized cultural dispositions play an important role in shaping the interpersonal environment and that the dynamic link between culture and social structure needs to be reconsidered.

<title>Modeling influence on posting engagement in online social networks: Beyond neighborhood effects</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.05.005</url>
<snippet>In many online social networks (OSN), Member A can observe the online participation of Member B and thus may be exposed to a shift in the online participation of B. Such exposure is often modeled by a neighbor-to-neighbor spreading process that can lead to local influence. In other words, exposure to participation shifts of Neighbor B can exert local influence on A's posting engagement. Since many posts nowadays are public rather than private, exposure to participation shifts of non-neighbors outside A's neighborhood can exert global influence on A's posting engagement. We model influence spread in an OSN by differentiating between exposure to participation shifts of local and global influence sources. The results of applying the proposed model to different temporal dynamic OSNs show evidence of both local and global influence on posting engagement of members. This consideration of global influence in OSNs, beyond neighborhood effects, extends past research that focused mainly on local influence and provides new insights about influence sources in general and viral marketing in particular.

<title>Using Ego Network Data to Inform Agent-based Models of Diffusion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0049124118769100</url>
<snippet>Agent-based modeling holds great potential as an analytical tool. Agent-based models (ABMs) are, however, also vulnerable to critique, as they often employ stylized social worlds, with little connection to the actual environment in question. Given these concerns, there has been a recent call to more fully incorporate empirical data into ABMs. This article falls in this tradition, exploring the benefits of using sampled ego network data in ABMs of cultural diffusion. Thus, instead of relying on full network data, which can be difficult and costly to collect, or no empirical network data, which is convenient but not empirically grounded, we offer a middle-ground, one combining ABMs with recent work on network sampling. The main question is whether this approach is effective. We provide a test of the approach using six complete networks; the test also includes a range of diffusion models (where actors follow different rules of adoption). For each network, we take a random ego network sample and use that sample to infer the full network structure. We then run a diffusion model through the known, complete networks, as well as the inferred networks, and compare the results. The results, on the whole, are quite strong: Across all analyses, the diffusion curves based on the sampled data are very similar to the curves based on the true, complete network. This suggests that ego network sampling can, in fact, offer a practical means of incorporating empirical data into an agent-based model.

<title>Imagined social structures: Mirrors or alternatives? A comparison between networks of characters in contemporary Dutch literature and networks of the population in the Netherlands</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2019.101379</url>
<snippet>We study whether patterns of segregation and homogeneity in personal networks in the Netherlands are comparable to the network structures of characters in modern Dutch literature and examine the degree to which social divides in terms of sex, education, ethnicity, and age are reflected in literary novels. A representative sample of people living in the Netherlands (the Survey of the Social Networks of the Dutch, SSND 2014, n = 967 respondents and 3424 network members) is employed as well as a representative sample from Dutch literary fiction published in 2012 and submitted to the Libris Prize (n = 170 books and 1292 characters). While controlling for author characteristics, our multilevel regression models reveal that networks in books are more diverse in terms of ethnicity, education and age. However, higher levels of education show more closure in books than in the actual world, and the same holds for characters with a higher age. We conclude with a discussion of the relationship between literature and society.

<title>How do youth choose activities? Assessing the relative importance of the micro-selection mechanisms behind adolescent extracurricular activity participation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.12.008</url>
<snippet>We investigate the network micro-selection mechanisms responsible for patterns of high school student extracurricular activity (ECA) participation, with a particular focus on those that can lead to ethnoracial segregation. We identify six types of mechanisms by which students select into activities (e.g., peer influence, homophily), which we test using a unique longitudinal dataset that combines student surveys with yearbook data on ECA involvement. These contexts represent two ethnoracially diverse U.S. high schools involving 2403 students and over 200 different activities spanning two school years. Using a stochastic actor-oriented model for two-mode networks, we find support for the hypothesized activity selection mechanisms. Follow-up analyses convey the relative importance of different mechanisms and inform our discussion of how ECA participation patterns develop and possible sources of segregation. Whereas selection is driven by mechanisms that include influence from friends and co-participants and similarity to fellow participants, no single overarching mechanism appears strong enough to fully account for ECA segregation

<title>DIFFERENTIAL PARTICIPATION IN PROFESSIONAL ACTIVISM: THE CASE OF THE GUANTANAMO HABEAS LAWYERS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Scholars of social movements tend to regard professionals as a homogeneous group whose activism plays a secondary role in mobilization processes. In this article, I focus on activism driven by professionals themselves and therein examine how heterogeneous professionals participate in their activism. Drawing on the case of the Guantanamo habeas lawyers, I utilize a two-step methodology to investigate the factors that contribute to the differential participation of legal professionals. The first stage of analysis shows that while lawyers with higher status played a critical role in initiating professional activism under a hostile environment, the Rasul v. Bush ruling opened up a legal opportunity for lawyers with lower status to participate in activism. In the second stage, social network analyses of the lawyers' collaborative structure reveal that movement-affiliated lawyers played a bridging role that coordinated initiators and latecomers. The results have important implications for understanding professionals' participation in contentious politics.

<title>Toward Detecting Rumor Initiator in Online Social Networks Using Ontology-Driven Model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13369-024-08852-7</url>
<snippet>Online social networks (OSNs) have become breeding grounds for negative content like rumor, misinformation, disinformation, etc. A rumor is an unverified piece of information in circulation. Rumor diffusion is one of the important problems that OSNs are facing. Finding rumor initiator in an OSN is both important and challenging. Firstly, most of the solutions proposed are based on network structure while completely ignoring network semantics. Secondly, the solutions proposed are for networks that are limited in cycles, directions, and degrees. To deal with semantics and limited network structure, researchers have proposed ontological models for OSNs. However, these models are intended to solve problems like social tagging mechanism, social network access control, rumor detection, rumor modeling, etc., rather than finding rumor initiators in OSNs. In this research article, we propose an ontology-based model for OSNs that is intended to find rumor initiators in OSNs. This model comprises three layers-design-time layer, integration layer, and runtime layer. The model maps interoperable concepts of different OSNs in the upper-level ontology, which is further used to obtain vendor-specific lower-level ontology. The model is populated and queried using the property path expressions of SPARQL to find rumor initiators for two scenarios, viz. when the veracity of the rumor is known and when the veracity of the rumor is unknown. Further, the model is assessed using the OQuaRE framework for ontology quality assessment. The OQuaRE framework evaluated our proposed model for seven characteristics of ontology quality, viz. structural, functional adequacy, maintainability, reliability, operability, compatibility, and transferability.

<title>Why network structure and coordination matter: A social network analysis of sport for disadvantaged people</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1012690216666273</url>
<snippet>Although local governments attempt to promote sports among all layers of society, people with a lower socio-economic status are still under-represented in grassroots sports. Previous studies indicate that inter-sectoral networks and joint efforts can contribute to an increase in sport participation among these groups, but a systematic analysis of the structure, coordination and interactions in the networks is still missing. Insight into networks to promote sport for disadvantaged people may help in designing effective networks. Therefore, we conducted a social network analysis to explore the network structure and characteristics of networks that promote sport participation among disadvantaged people in three Flemish cities. Our results show that the networks needed to be coordinated by a sport administrator, in the initial stage. Once the network is up and running, coordination can be shared so that the sport administration can rely on the experiences of other sectors. More sport initiatives and a better network structure were found in the cities with a community sport development program, through which the sport-for-all policy is implemented and coordinated, compared to a city without such a program.

<title>Friends in locked places: An investigation of prison inmate network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2016.12.006</url>
<snippet>The current study investigates informal social structure among prison inmates. Data come from the Prison Inmate Network Study (PINS), a project focused on a unit of a Pennsylvania medium security men's prison. We focus on 205 inmates and their "get along with" network - an approximation of friendship in other settings. We find a weak subgroup structure dominated by two groups of "old heads" and characterized by moderate (non gang-based) race/ethnic clustering. Structurally, the network resembles adolescents in schools, suggesting that prison inmates are capable, of successfully building peer associations. We conclude that under the right conditions self-organizing inmate society can foster social integration reminiscent of other social settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Conditionally exponential random models for individual properties and network structures: Method and application</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2016.09.001</url>
<snippet>Exponential random models have been widely adopted as a general probabilistic framework for complex networks and recently extended to embrace broader statistical settings such as dynamic networks, valued networks or two-mode networks. Our aim is to provide a further step into the generalization of this class of models by considering sample spaces which involve both families of networks and nodal properties verifying combinatorial constraints. We propose a class of probabilistic models for the joint distribution of nodal properties (demographic and behavioral characteristics) and network structures (friendship and professional partnership). It results in a general and flexible modeling framework to account for homophily in social structures. We present a Bayesian estimation method based on the full characterization of their sample spaces by systems of linear constraints. This provides an exact simulation scheme to sample from the likelihood, based on linear programming techniques. After a detailed analysis of the proposed statistical methodology, we illustrate our approach with an empirical analysis of co-authorship of journal articles in the field of neuroscience between 2009 and 2013.

<title>Utility and dynamic social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-8733(00)00024-1</url>
<snippet>A dynamic process model of utility maximizing social actors embedded within social networks is developed. Actors make social choices under four combinations of tie formation and deletion rules: unilateral and mutual tie formation, and unilateral and mutual tie deletion. Ties are dual valued, parameterized with both a benefit and a cost. A utility function is used to assess the structurally determined utility of an actor's position in the social network. The process generates eight types of networks: Null. near-Null, Star, near-Star, Shared, near-Shared, Complete, near-Complete. Agent-based simulation modeling is the basic methodology used in these analyses. Two types of simulation models were developed: a multi-thread "real time" model, and a discrete event model.

<title>Resilience and fragmentation in healthcare coalitions: The link between resource contributions and centrality in health-related interorganizational networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.07.004</url>
<snippet>Interorganizational coalitions or collaboratives in healthcare are essential to address the health challenges of local communities, particularly during crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic. However, few studies use large-scale data to systematically assess the network structure of these collaboratives and understand their potential to be resilient or fragment in the face of structural changes. This paper analyzes data collected in 2009-2017 about 817 organizations (nodes) in 42 healthcare collaboratives (networks) throughout Florida, the third-largest U.S. state by population, including information about interorganizational ties and organizations' resource contributions to their coalitions. Social network methods are used to characterize the resilience of these collaboratives, including identification of key players through various centrality metrics, analyses of fragmentation centrality and core/periphery structure, and Exponential Random Graph Models to examine how resource contributions facilitate interorganizational ties. Results show that the most significant resource contributions are made by key players identified through fragmentation centrality and by members of the network core. Departure or removal of these organizations would both strongly disrupt network structure and sever essential resource contributions, undermining the overall resilience of a collaborative. Furthermore, one-third of collaboratives are highly susceptible to disruption if any fragmentation-central organization is removed. More fragmented networks are also associated with poorer health-system outcomes in domains such as education, health policy, and services. ERGMs reveal that two types of resource contributions - community connections and in-kind resource sharing - are especially important to facilitate the formation of interorganizational ties in these coalitions.

In this article, we review sociological research that examines the processes through which dyadic ties form, persist, and dissolve. Three sociological mechanisms are overviewed: assortative mechanisms that draw attention to the role of actors' attributes, relational mechanisms that emphasize the influence of existing relationships and network positions, and proximity mechanisms that focus on the social organization of interaction.

<title>Consumer Culture, Taste Preferences, and Social Network Formation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/soc4.12265</url>
<snippet>One of the most important and consistent findings in the social networks literature is that individuals are socially connected to people who resemble themselves. This finding extends to preferences for consumer culture. Whereas network theorists previously had presumed that social networks generated this outcome through a process of social influence, this traditional conception of the relationship between culture and social networks has been challenged by new theoretical perspectives and novel methodological techniques that enable researchers to empirically test the causal direction of the relationship. In this article, I first discuss how theorists have adjudicated between competing explanations of the relationship of taste preferences and social network structure. Second, I discuss how sociologists have theorized that tastes contribute to variation in network structure. Third, I examine survey and ethnographic research that discusses interactional mechanisms by which people actively mobilize culture to form social relationships. Fourth and finally, I discuss research that explores how consumer culture constitutes the meaning of social relationships and how relationship category affects theorizing of network formation.

<title>Monophily in social networks introduces similarity among friends-of-friends</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-018-0321-8</url>
<snippet>The observation that individuals tend to be friends with people who are similar to themselves, commonly known as homophily, is a prominent feature of social networks. While homophily describes a bias in attribute preferences for similar others, it gives limited attention to variability. Here, we observe that attribute preferences can exhibit variation beyond what can be explained by homophily. We call this excess variation monophily to describe the presence of individuals with extreme preferences for a particular attribute possibly unrelated to their own attribute. We observe that monophily can induce a similarity among friends-of-friends without requiring any similarity among friends. To simulate homophily and monophily in synthetic networks, we propose an overdispersed extension of the classical stochastic block model. We use this model to demonstrate how homophily-based methods for predicting attributes on social networks based on friends (that is, 'the company you keep') are fundamentally different from monophily-based methods based on friends-of-friends (that is, 'the company you're kept in'). We place particular focus on predicting gender, where homophily can be weak or non-existent in practice. These findings offer an alternative perspective on network structure and prediction, complicating the already difficult task of protecting privacy on social networks.

<title>Vaccination homophily in ego contact networks during the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-65986-2</url>
<snippet>Vaccine hesitancy is an inevitable risk for societies as it contributes to outbreaks of diseases. Prior research suggests that vaccination decisions of individuals tend to spread within social networks, resulting in a tendency to vaccination homophily. The clustering of individuals resistant to vaccination can substantially make the threshold necessary to achieve herd immunity harder to reach. In this study, we examined the extent of vaccination homophily among social contacts and its association with vaccine uptake during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary using a contact diary approach in two cross-sectional surveys. The results indicate strong clustering among both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. The most powerful predictor of vaccine uptake was the perceived vaccination rate within the egos' social contact network. Vaccination homophily and the role of the interpersonal contact network in vaccine uptake were particularly pronounced in the networks of close relationships, including family, kinship, and strong social ties of the ego. Our findings have important implications for understanding COVID-19 spread dynamics by showing that the strong clustering of unvaccinated individuals posed a great risk in preventing the spread of the disease.

<title>Social Networks and Social Settings: Developing a Coevolutionary View</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11577-014-0271-8</url>
<snippet>One way to think about social context is as a sample of alters. To understand individual action, therefore, it matters greatly where these alters may be coming from, and how they are connected. According to one vision, connections among alters induce local dependencies-emergent rules of social interaction that generate endogenously the observed network structure of social settings. Social selection is the decision of interest in this perspective. According to a second vision, social settings are collections of social foci-physical or symbolic locales where actors meet. Because alters are more likely to be drawn from focused sets, shared social foci are frequently considered as the main generators of network ties, and hence of setting structure. Affiliation to social foci is the decision of central interest in this second view. In this paper we show how stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs) originally derived for studying the dynamics of multiple networks may be adopted to represent and examine these interconnected systems of decisions (selection and affiliation) within a unified analytical framework. We illustrate the empirical value of the model in the context of a longitudinal sample of adolescent participating in the Glasgow Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study. Social selection decisions are examined in the context of networks of friendship relations. The analysis treats musical genres as the main social foci of interest.

<title>Extremists of a feather flock together? Community structures, transitivity, and patterns of homophily in the US Islamist co-offending network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0298273</url>
<snippet>Prior research suggests that members of terrorist groups prioritize forming network ties based on trust to improve their organizational and operational security. The homophily principle, which postulates that individuals tend to form relationships based on shared characteristics, can be a key mechanism through which people identify trustworthy associates. Next to homophily, the mechanism of establishing interconnected relationships through transitivity is also well-known to serve this purpose and shape community structures in social networks. We analyze the community structures of the Islamist co-offending network in the United States, which is highly violent, to assess whether homophily and transitivity determine which extremists form co-offending ties. We rely on a new database on the individual attributes and the co-offending relationships of 494 Islamist offenders radicalized in the United States between 1993 and 2020. Using community detection algorithms, we show that the US Islamist co-offending network is highly clustered, modular, and includes many small but only a few large communities. Furthermore, results from exponential random graph modeling show that transitive relationships as well as spatial proximity, ideological affiliation, and shared socio-cultural characteristics drive co-offending among US Islamist extremists. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the processes of homophily and transitivity shape violent social networks.

<title>Identifying the roles of race-based choice and chance in high school friendship network formation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0911793107</url>
<snippet>Homophily, the tendency of people to associate with others similar to themselves, is observed in many social networks, ranging from friendships to marriages to business relationships, and is based on a variety of characteristics, including race, age, gender, religion, and education. We present a technique for distinguishing two primary sources of homophily: biases in the preferences of individuals over the types of their friends and biases in the chances that people meet individuals of other types. We use this technique to analyze racial patterns in friendship networks in a set of American high schools from the Add Health dataset. Biases in preferences and biases in meeting rates are both highly significant in these data, and both types of biases differ significantly across races. Asians and Blacks are biased toward interacting with their own race at rates &gt; 7 times higher than Whites, whereas Hispanics exhibit an intermediate bias in meeting opportunities. Asians exhibit the least preference bias, valuing friendships with other types 90&#37; as much as friendships with Asians, whereas Blacks and Hispanics value friendships with other types 55&#37; and 65&#37; as much as same-type friendships, respectively, and Whites fall in between, valuing other-type friendships 75&#37; as much as friendships with Whites. Meetings are significantly more biased in large schools (&gt; 1,000 students) than in small schools (&lt; 1,000 students), and biases in preferences exhibit some significant variation with the median household income levels in the counties surrounding the schools.

<snippet>Information about social networks can often be collected as event stream data. However, most methods in social network analysis are defined for static network snapshots or for panel data. We propose an actor oriented Markov process framework to analyze the structural dynamics in event streams. Estimated parameters are similar to what is known from exponential random graph models or stochastic actor oriented models as implemented in SIENA. We apply the methodology on a question and answer web community and show how the relevance of different kinds of one- and two-mode network structures can be tested using a new software.

<title>How Do Low-Income People Form Survival Networks? Routine Organizations as Brokers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002716220915431</url>
<snippet>While supportive social ties help to buffer against the consequences of poverty, few researchers have examined how people form such ties. New ties are often formed in routine organizations such as businesses, churches, and childcare centers, which, beyond being places to work, shop, or receive services, are institutionally governed spaces of social interaction. Based on the notion of organizational brokerage, we introduce a perspective that specifies when routine organizations contribute to tie formation and use it to reexamine data from existing qualitative studies of such organizations among the poor. We argue that successful brokerage will depend on the degree to which an organization's institutional norms render interaction among participants frequent, long-lasting, focused on others, and centered on joint tasks; and that the ensuing networks may differ from other supportive ties in the sense of belonging they may cultivate, the form of generalized exchange they may engender, and the organizational connections they may create.

<title>Causal inference over stochastic networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jrsssa/qnae001</url>
<snippet>Claiming causal inferences in network settings necessitates careful consideration of the often complex dependency between outcomes for actors. Of particular importance are treatment spillover or outcome interference effects. We consider causal inference when the actors are connected via an underlying network structure. Our key contribution is a model for causality when the underlying network is endogenous; where the ties between actors and the actor covariates are statistically dependent. We develop a joint model for the relational and covariate generating process that avoids restrictive separability and fixed network assumptions, as these rarely hold in realistic social settings. While our framework can be used with general models, we develop the highly expressive class of Exponential-family Random Network models (ERNM) of which Markov random fields and Exponential-family Random Graph models are special cases. We present potential outcome-based inference within a Bayesian framework and propose a modification to the exchange algorithm to allow for sampling from ERNM posteriors. We present results of a simulation study demonstrating the validity of the approach. Finally, we demonstrate the value of the framework in a case study of smoking in the context of adolescent friendship networks.

<title>Social Distance in the United States: Sex, Race, Religion, Age, and Education Homophily among Confidants, 1985 to 2004</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122414531776</url>
<snippet>Homophily, the tendency for similar actors to be connected at a higher rate than dissimilar actors, is a pervasive social fact. In this article, we examine changes over a 20-year period in two types of homophily-the actual level of contact between people in different social categories and the level of contact relative to chance. We use data from the 1985 and 2004 General Social Surveys to ask whether the strengths of five social distinctions-sex, race/ethnicity, religious affiliation, age, and education-changed over the past two decades in core discussion networks. Changes in the actual level of homophily are driven by the demographic composition of the United States. As the nation has become more diverse, cross-category contacts in race/ethnicity and religion have increased. After describing the raw homophily rates, we develop a case-control model to assess homophily relative to chance mixing. We find decreasing rates of homophily for gender but stability for race and age, although the young are increasingly isolated from older cohorts outside of the family. We also find some weak evidence for increasing educational and religious homophily. These relational trends may be explained by changes in demographic heterogeneity, institutional segregation, economic inequality, and symbolic boundaries.

<title>Conditional independence in dynamic networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2012.03.002</url>
<snippet>Given a longitudinal network observed at time points t(1) &lt; . . . &lt; t(r), tie changes that happen in the interval (t(h), t(h+1)) typically depend on the networks at t(1) , . . . , t(h). In this article we deal with the question whether changes within one interval mutually depend on each other or whether they are conditionally independent, given the previously observed networks. Answering this question for given data is of high practical relevance since, if the conditional independence assumption is valid, network dynamics can be modeled with simple and computationally efficient statistical techniques for independent observations. Consequently, we propose a framework to systematically compare conditional independence models with more general models that are specifically designed for social network data. Our results suggest that conditional independence models are inappropriate as a general model for network evolution and can lead to distorted substantive findings on structural network effects, such as transitivity. On the other hand, the conditional independence assumption becomes less severe when inter-observation times are relatively short. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2017.01.005</url>
<snippet>A group's resilience is often linked to its network structure. While decentralized network properties have been associated with resilience at the group-level, little is known about the individual-level factors that lead groups to adopt these structures. Criminal groups, consistently faced with unexpected external disruptions, provide an opportunity to examine individual decisions to collaborate across periods of increased risk. Using data on 118 terrorist offenders across six attacks we test whether individual decisions to collaborate are influenced by variation in law enforcement activity. Results from exponential random graph models demonstrate that many of the processes that drive collaboration between offenders differ when faced with greater risk. Connectivity was maximized in periods of decreased enforcement activity, with offenders more likely to collaborate in dense, local triads. Following an increase in interdictions, triad closure had no impact on co-offending. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Social influence or selection? Peer effects on the development of adolescents' educational expectations in Germany</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01425692.2020.1763163</url>
<snippet>Educational expectations are a key predictor of educational attainment. Throughout adolescence, friends increasingly function as 'significant others' and, thus, can affect the development of these expectations. Although scholars often interpret the clustering of students with similar expectations within friendship networks as the outcome of peer influence, a similarity of friends can also be a result of friendship selection processes and preselection due to ability tracking. We apply multilevel social network models to panel data of adolescents from Germany (1,992 ninth-grade students in 91 classes) to disentangle these mechanisms. Beyond selecting similar friends (homophily), we find that adolescents adapt their expectations towards the average expectations of their friends (social influence) but only in secondary-school tracks that support diverse educational paths. We conclude that peer socialization is important for the development of students' educational expectations in contexts that are sufficiently heterogeneous to allow for the emergence of distinct peer milieus.

<title>Friendships and Social Networks in an Individual-Based Model of Primate Social Behaviour</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3450</url>
<snippet>The individual-based model GrooFiWorld proposes a parsimonious theory explaining the complex behaviour of macaque societies. It suggests that the socio-spatial structure of the group underlies the emergence of complex behaviour. A spatial structure with dominants at the center and subordinates at the periphery emerges due to aggression. This structure influences the distribution of social interactions: individuals interact more with close-by partners and thus several behavioural patterns emerge. In GrooFiWorld, however, individuals have no preferential interactions; whereas in primates, individuals prefer interactions with 'friends'. The distribution of interactions, then, may be influenced by 'friendships' rather than spatial structure. To study this, here, we omitted space from the model and investigated the effects of 'friendships' on the emergence of social behaviour and network structure. Results show that 'friendships' promote cooperation but fail to produce other patterns characteristic of macaques. This highlights the importance that spatial structure may have in structuring macaque societies.

<title>The spread of fake news: Disclosure willingness role</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34468</url>
<snippet>The epidemic has had a profound negative impact on individuals worldwide, leading to pervasive anxiety, fear, and mental instability. Exploiting these fears, a significant amount of fake information proliferates and spreads rapidly on social networks. This study explores the factors that cause individuals to believe fake news under stressful and fearful conditions by applying the truth-default theory. Data was collected online in Vietnam, using Smart PLS software to analyze the research model. The findings indicated that risk perception, media trust, trust in celebrity posts, and stress were factors that urge users to believe news posted on social media, and even they actively share this news on their own channels. Disclosure willingness moderated the relationship between adoption fake news and sharing it. Both theoretical and practical implications were discussed.

<title>A comparative study of social network models: Network evolution models and nodal attribute models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2009.06.004</url>
<snippet>This paper reviews, classifies and compares recent models for social networks that have mainly been published within the physics-oriented complex networks literature. The models fall into two categories: those in which the addition of new links is dependent on the (typically local) network structure (network evolution models, NEMs), and those in which links are generated based only on nodal attributes (nodal attribute models, NAMs). An exponential random graph model (ERGM) with structural dependencies is included for comparison. We fit models from each of these categories to two empirical acquaintance networks with respect to basic network properties. We compare higher order structures in the resulting networks with those in the data, with the aim of determining which models produce the most realistic network structure with respect to degree distributions, assortativity, clustering spectra, geodesic path distributions, and community structure (subgroups with dense internal connections). We find that the nodal attribute models successfully produce assortative networks and very clear community structure. However, they generate unrealistic clustering spectra and peaked degree distributions that do not match empirical data on large social networks. On the other hand, many of the network evolution models produce degree distributions and clustering spectra that agree more closely with data. They also generate assortative networks and community structure, although often not to the same extent as in the data. The ERGM model, which turned out to be near-degenerate in the parameter region best fitting our data, produces the weakest community structure. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<snippet>We examine how the structure and content of individuals' networks in the workplace affect intraorganizational mobility. Consistent with prior research, we find that an. individual's mobility is enhanced by having a large, sparse network of informal ties for acquiring information and resources. However in contrast to previous work, we emphasize the importance of consistent role expectations for performance and mobility. We find evidence that well-defined performance expectations are more likely to arise from a small, dense network of individuals. We develop a typology of network contents and document the interaction between network structure and content in analyses of mobility among employees of a high-technology firm. We also examine how the effects of tie duration on mobility vary by tie content. We discuss the implications of our results for theory and research on networks and organizational mobility.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-019-0189-5</url>
<snippet>How diverse are sharing economy platforms? Are they fair marketplaces, where all participants operate on a level playing field, or are they large-scale online aggregators of offline human biases? Often portrayed as easy-to-access digital spaces whose participants receive equal opportunities, such platforms have recently come under fire due to reports of discriminatory behaviours among their users, and have been associated with gentrification phenomena that exacerbate preexisting inequalities along racial lines. In this paper, we focus on the Airbnb sharing economy platform, and analyse the diversity of its user base across five large cities. We find it to be predominantly young, female, and white. Notably, we find this to be true even in cities with a diverse racial composition. We then introduce a method based on the statistical analysis of networks to quantify behaviours of homophily, heterophily and avoidance between Airbnb hosts and guests. Depending on cities and property types, we do find signals of such behaviours relating both to race and gender. We use these findings to provide platform design recommendations, aimed at exposing and possibly reducing the biases we detect, in support of a more inclusive growth of sharing economy platforms.

<title>The Double Edge of Common Interest: Ethnic Segregation as an Unintended Byproduct of Opinion Homophily</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0038040711427314</url>
<snippet>How can we reduce ethnic friendship segregation in ethnically heterogeneous schools? The Common Ingroup Identity Model suggests that interethnic friendships are promoted by those intervention programs that focus on the interests students have in common. The authors argue that the outcome of these common interest interventions may crucially depend on sufficient consensus in participants' opinions regarding the shared interest. Such an intervention may backfire and increase ethnic segregation if participants from different ethnic groups have different opinions about the common interest. The authors test their argument analyzing the dynamics of friendship networks and opinions in 48 school classes with an actor-based stochastic model. Their findings suggest that salient common interests in ethnically mixed school classes can indeed reduce ethnic segregation. However, they also found that friendship selection on the basis of similar opinions can foster ethnic segregation. This occurred when ethnicity was correlated with the opinions that students held regarding the salient interest, even when these students did not prefer intra-ethnic friendship per se.

<snippet>Referrals and information flow distort market mechanisms of hiring in the labor market, but they might assist employers under asymmetric information in finding better alternatives. This paper investigates whether an impartial information flow between employers in a cyclic network structure could generate more discrimination than when no information is exchanged between employers. We set up an artificial labor market in which there was no average quality difference between two categories of workers. We asked participants to play the role of employers and examined the partiality of their hiring choices. Results showed that discrimination was prevalent in all conditions. Higher standards by the employers for the quality of workers increased discrimination as did the presence of referrals from workers. Unexpectedly, impartial information flow in a cyclic network of employers did not help to decrease discrimination. We also showed that these mechanisms interact with and subdue each other in complex ways. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

<title>Estimating Homophily in Social Networks Using Dyadic Predictions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.15195/v8.a14</url>
<snippet>Predictions of node categories are commonly used to estimate homophily and other relational properties in networks. However, little is known about the validity of using predictions for this task. We show that estimating homophily in a network is a problem of predicting categories of dyads (edges) in the graph. Homophily estimates are unbiased when predictions of dyad categories are unbiased. Node-level prediction models, such as the use of names to classify ethnicity or gender, do not generally produce unbiased predictions of dyad categories and therefore produce biased homophily estimates. Bias comes from three sources: sampling bias, correlation between model errors and node degree, and correlation between node-level model errors along dyads. We examine three methods for estimating homophily: predicting node categories, predicting dyad categories, and a hybrid "ego-alter" approach. This analysis indicates that only the dyadic prediction approach is unbiased, whereas the node-level approach produces both high bias and high overall error. We find that node-level classification performance is not a reliable indicator of accuracy for homophily. Although this article focuses on a particular version of homophily, results generalize to heterophilous cases and other dyadic measures. We conclude with suggestions for research design.

<title>Echo chambers and viral misinformation: Modeling fake news as complex contagion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203958</url>
<snippet>The viral spread of digital misinformation has become so severe that the World Economic Forum considers it among the main threats to human society. This spread have been suggested to be related to the similarly problematized phenomenon of "echo chambers", but the causal nature of this relationship has proven difficult to disentangle due to the connected nature of social media, whose causality is characterized by complexity, non-linearity and emergence. This paper uses a network simulation model to study a possible relationship between echo chambers and the viral spread of misinformation. It finds an "echo chamber effect": the presence of an opinion and network polarized cluster of nodes in a network contributes to the diffusion of complex contagions, and there is a synergetic effect between opinion and network polarization on the virality of misinformation. The echo chambers effect likely comes from that they form the initial bandwagon for diffusion. These findings have implication for the study of the media logic of new social media.

<snippet>This paper describes the structure of social networks of students within school classes and examines differences in network structure between classes. In order to examine the network structure within school classes, we focused in particular on the principle of homophily, i.e. the tendency that people associate with similar others. When differences between classes were observed, it was investigated whether these were related to group compositional characteristics. A two-stage regression procedure is proposed to analyze social networks of multiple groups. The random coefficient model is discussed briefly as an alternative to the two-stage method.

<title>Social network effects on academic achievement</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2017.06.001</url>
<snippet>How peer groups contribute to educational outcomes has long interested researchers. However, the possibility that peer groups dominated by either low- or high-achieving youth can have substantively different effects on achievement has been largely ignored. In this paper, we show that while being embedded in a high-achieving network of friends is not associated with increased own achievement, being embedded in a low-achieving network is associated with decreased own achievement. In additional analyses, we present evidence that these associations are at least in part due to influence, as opposed to only selection effects or shared environment. We also examine whether the structure of the network in which a student is embedded might affect their educational achievement. We show that achieving at higher levels positively predicts how centrally located a student is in their network, but being more centrally located does not predict concurrent achievement. This finding suggests that the behavior of individuals is affecting the formation of network structure and not the reverse. (C) 2017 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2020.1818078</url>
<snippet>Fragmentation, echo chambers, and their amelioration in social networks have been a growing concern in the academic and non-academic world. This paper shows how, under the assumption of homophily, echo chambers and fragmentation are system-immanent phenomena of highly flexible social networks, even under ideal conditions for heterogeneity. We achieve this by finding an analytical, network-based solution to the Schelling model and by proving that weak ties do not hinder the process. Furthermore, we derive that no level of positive algorithmic bias in the form of rewiring is capable of preventing fragmentation and its effect on reducing the fragmentation speed is negligible.

<title>Hegemonic and Other Masculinities in Local Social Contexts</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X06298776</url>
<snippet>This article is a theoretical examination of Connell's social theory of gender, discussing how hegemonic, complicit, subordinate, and marginalized masculinities interact and relate to one another in the men's everyday lives in particular social contexts. Connell's theory is articulated in global terms that need to be localized to examine the actual interactions of men with one another. The theory implies a multilevel framework that the authors develop more explicitly. They investigate two interrelated theoretical concerns: (a) inadequately detailed interdependencies between structural, individual, and cultural factors with respect to masculinities, and (b) the lack of contextualization of masculinities in specific relational settings. The authors suggest that theoretical insights gained from social network theory and analysis allow such issues to be addressed and assist in local-level accounts of gendered power relations. The authors conclude by specifying Connell's theory into particular, testable hypotheses for use with statistical models for social networks.

<title>Demographic and HIV status diversities as mechanisms of social integration and segregation among Black sexual and gender minorities enrolled in a community-based social network intervention</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.12.006</url>
<snippet>Drawing on a social integration and intersectionality framework, this study advances a dynamic network un-derstanding of the mechanisms that enable differential patterns of within-group social integration and segre-gation among Black sexual and gender minorities (BSGM). Specifically, in a cohort of BSGM (18-35 years of age, n symbolscript 340) participating in a community-based network intervention for HIV prevention, we examine how sexual, gender, age, and HIV status diversities contribute to friendship formation and maintenance patterns over the 12 -month study enrollment period. We found attenuated social integration (or social activity) among non-gay -identified and older BSGM and evidence of social segregation (or homophily) on the basis of sexual identity and age similarities. Accounting for the moderating effects of the intervention revealed that the attenuated integration of non-gay-identified and older BSGM were stronger for participants who received the peer leader-ship training, and integration challenges were also found for transgender BSGM who received the peer leadership training. Meanwhile, BSGM living with HIV who received the peer leadership training were significantly more integrated than their counterparts in the control arm. These findings help us understand the complicated social fabric among BSGM and the dynamics that interventions for this community may have to contend with or alter.

<title>Too many options: How to identify coalitions in a policy network?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2024.06.005</url>
<snippet>For different currents in policy analysis as policy networks and the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), identifying coalitions from policy beliefs and coordination between actors is crucial to a precise understanding of a policy process. Focusing particularly the relational dimension of ACF approaches linked with policy network analysis, determining policy subsystems from the actor collaborations and exchanges has recently begun offering fertile links with the network analysis. Studies in this way frequently apply Block Modeling and Community Detection (BMCD) strategies to define homogeneous political groups. However, the BMCD literature is growing quickly, using a wide variety of algorithms and interesting selection methods that are much more diverse than those used in the policy network analysis and particularly the ACF when this current focused on the collaboration networks before or after regarding the belief distance between actors. Identifying the best methodological option in a specific context can therefore be difficult and few ACF studies give an explicit justification. On the other hand, few BMCD publications offer a systematic comparison of real social networks and they are never applied to policy network datasets. This paper offers a new, relevant 5-Step selection method to reconcile advances in both the policy networks/ACF and BMCD. Using an application based on original African policy network data collected in Madagascar and Niger, we provide a useful set of practical recommendations for future ACF studies using policy network analysis: (i) the density and size of the policy network affect the identification process, (ii) the "best algorithm"can be rigorously determined by maximizing a novel indicator based on convergence and homogeneity between algorithm results, (iii) researchers need to be careful with missing data: they affect the results and imputation does not solve the problem.

<title>Modeling the Role of Networks and Individual Differences in Inter-Group Violence</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0148314</url>
<snippet>There is significant heterogeneity within and between populations in their propensity to engage in conflict. Most research has neglected the role of within-group effects in social networks in contributing to between-group violence and focused instead on the precursors and consequences of violence, or on the role of between-group ties. Here, we explore the role of individual variation and of network structure within a population in promoting and inhibiting group violence towards other populations. Motivated by ethnographic observations of collective behavior in a small-scale society, we describe a model with differentiated roles for individuals embedded within friendship networks. Using a simple model based on voting-like dynamics, we explore several strategies for influencing group-level behavior. When we consider changing population level attitude changes and introducing control nodes separately, we find that a particularly effective control strategy relies on exploiting network degree. We also suggest refinements to our model such as tracking fine-grained information spread dynamics that can lead to further enrichment in using evolutionary game theory models for sociological phenomena.

<title>Multilevel longitudinal analysis of social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jrsssa/qnac009</url>
<snippet>Stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs) are a modelling framework for analysing network dynamics using network panel data. This paper extends the SAOM to the analysis of multilevel network panels through a random coefficient model, estimated with a Bayesian approach. The proposed model allows testing theories about network dynamics, social influence, and interdependence of multiple networks. It is illustrated by a study of the dynamic interdependence of friendship networks and minor delinquency. Data were available for 126 classrooms in the first year of secondary school, of which 82 were used, containing relatively few missing data points and having not too much network turnover.

<title>The Trojan-horse mechanism: How networks reduce gender segregation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abf6730</url>
<snippet>The segregation of labor markets along ethnic and gender lines is socially highly consequential, and the social science literature has long viewed homophily and network-based job recruitments as some of its most crucial drivers. Here, we focus on a previously unidentified mechanism, the Trojan-horse mechanism, which, in contradiction to the main tenet of previous research, suggests that network-based recruitment reduce rather than increase segregation levels. We identify the conditions under which networks are desegregating, and using unique data on all individuals and all workplaces located in the Stockholm region during the years 2000-2017, we find strong empirical evidence for the Trojan-horse mechanism and its role in the gender segregation of labor markets.

<title>The ambivalence of cultural homophily: Field positions, semantic similarities, and social network ties in creative collectives</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2019.02.004</url>
<snippet>This paper utilizes a mixture of qualitative, formal, and statistical socio-semantic network analyses to examine how cultural homophily works when field logic meets practice. On the one hand, because individuals in similar field positions are also imposed with similar cultural orientations, cultural homophily reproduces 'objective' field structure in intersubjective social network ties. On the other hand, fields are operative in practice and to accomplish pragmatic goals individuals who occupy different field positions often join in groups, creatively reinterpret the field-imposed cultural orientations, and produce cultural similarities alternative to the position-specific ones. Drawing on these emergent similarities, the cultural homophily mechanism might stimulate social network ties between members who occupy not the same but different field positions, thus contesting fields. I examine this ambivalent role of cultural homophily in two creative collectives, each embracing members positioned closer to the opposite poles of the field of cultural production. I find different types of cultural similarities to affect different types of social network ties within and between the field positions: Similarity of vocabularies stimulates friendship and collaboration ties within positions, thus reproducing the field, while affiliation with the same cultural structures stimulates collaboration ties between positions, thus contesting the field. The latter effect is visible under statistical analysis of ethnographic data, but easy to oversee in qualitative analysis of texts because informants tend to flag conformity to their positions in their explicit statements. This highlights the importance of mixed socio-semantic network analysis, both sensitive to the local context and capable of unveiling the mechanisms underlying the interplay between the cultural and the social.

<title>Measuring transnational social fields through binational link-tracing sampling</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253042</url>
<snippet>We advance bi-national link-tracing sampling design, an innovative data collection methodology for sampling from so-called "transnational social fields", i.e. transnational networks embedding migrants, returned migrants and non-migrants. This paper describes our contributions to this methodology and its empirical implementation, and evaluates the features of the resulting networks (sample), with the aim to guide future research. We performed 303 face-to-face structured interviews on sociodemographic variables, migration trajectories and personal networks of people living in a Romanian migration sending community (Dambovi?a) and in a migration receiving Spanish town (Castellon). Inter-connecting the personal networks, we built a multi-layered complex network structure embedding 4,855 nominated people, 5,477 directed ties (nominations) and 2,540 edges. Results indicate that the link-tracing nomination patterns are affected by sex and residence homophily. Our research contributes to the emerging efforts of applying social network analysis to the study of international migration.

<title>Incorporating structural stigma into network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2020.05.005</url>
<snippet>A rich literature has explored the modeling of homophily and other forms of nonuniform mixing associated with individual-level covariates within the exponential family random graph (ERGM) framework. Such differential mixing does not fully explain phenomena such as stigma, however, which involve the active maintenance of social boundaries by ostracism of persons with out-group ties. Here, we introduce a new family of statistics that allows for such effects to be captured, making it possible to probe for the potential presence of boundary maintenance above and beyond simple differences in nomination rates. We demonstrate these statistics in the context of gender segregation in a school classroom, and introduce a framework for understanding the associated coefficients via network perturbation.

<title>How do migrants' processes of social embedding unfold over time?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/glob.12297</url>
<snippet>In this article we investigate how migrants' processes of social (dis-) embedding in local and transnational contexts unfold over time and illustrate their driving forces. Drawing on unique longitudinal, mixed-methods social network data of 77 transnational migrants in Barcelona, Spain, we were able to capture changes in social relationships at a micro-level. We found that migrant embedding is far from a linear process. In many regards, the observed network dynamics are similar to those the literature observed for non-migrants; for example, the more substantial changes were typically caused by life events. We also found that migrants' opportunities to form new relationships with natives depended on their positions within their places of residence, which were structured by gender, race and class. These results call into question assumptions of individual agency in integration and assimilation debates. Furthermore, they call for a greater presence of temporality and life course scholarship in research into migrants' networks.

<title>Penalized homophily latent space models for directed scale-free networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253873</url>
<snippet>Online social networks like Twitter and Facebook are among the most popular sites on the Internet. Most online social networks involve some specific features, including reciprocity, transitivity and degree heterogeneity. Such networks are so called scale-free networks and have drawn lots of attention in research. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel methodology for directed network embedding within the latent space model (LSM) framework. It is known, the link probability between two individuals may increase as the features of each become similar, which is referred to as homophily attributes. To this end, penalized pair-specific attributes, acting as a distance measure, are introduced to provide with more powerful interpretation and improve link prediction accuracy, named penalized homophily latent space models (PHLSM). The proposed models also involve in-degree heterogeneity of directed scale-free networks by embedding with the popularity scales. We also introduce LASSO-based PHLSM to produce an accurate and sparse model for high-dimensional covariates. We make Bayesian inference using MCMC algorithms. The finite sample performance of the proposed models is evaluated by three benchmark simulation datasets and two real data examples. Our methods are competitive and interpretable, they outperform existing approaches for fitting directed networks.

<snippet>This paper analyzes the spatial dimensions of office layouts in diverse knowledge-intensive workplace environments based on the theoretical and methodological propositions of Space Syntax, and brings this together with the analysis of intra-organizational interaction networks. Physical distances between agents are modeled in different ways and used as explanatory variables in exponential random graph modeling. The paper shows that spatial configuration in offices can be considered an important but not sole rationale for tie formation. Furthermore, it is shown that spatial distance measures based on detailed configurational analysis outperform simple Euclidean distance metrics in predicting social ties. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

<title>Brokerage activity, exclusivity and role diversity: A three-dimensional approach to brokerage in networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.02.014</url>
<snippet>The purpose of this paper is to connect central theoretical contributions to the study of brokerage and propose a novel conceptual and analytical approach for investigating it. On one hand, it builds on, and further substantiate the utility of, the innovation of conceptualizing brokerage activity and brokerage exclusivity separately, whilst analyzing them together. On the other hand, it also builds on the seminal notion of qualitatively different brokerage roles and introduces the conceptual innovation of brokerage role diversity to study the implications of and for actors occupying one or several roles to similar or varying degrees. These implications are further unpacked by analyzing the specific brokerage activity and exclusivity for each brokerage role separately, before reassembling the results into a rich description of the patterns of brokerage among different types of actors. This three-dimensional approach was applied to study brokerage in a network of individual actors governing flood risk mitigation in a catchment area in Southern Sweden. The results suggest that studying these three dimensions of brokerage simultaneously provides a sharper lens that picks up important nuances that available approaches may fail to reveal. The paper makes a substantive contribution to the knowledge of brokerage in collaborative governance of complex issues, as well as a methodological contribution to the study of brokerage in general.

<title>Universal patterns of long-distance commuting and social assortativity in cities</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-00416-1</url>
<snippet>Millions commute to work every day in cities and interact with colleagues, partners, friends, and strangers. Commuting facilitates the mixing of people from distant and diverse neighborhoods, but whether this has an imprint on social inclusion or instead, connections remain assortative is less explored. In this paper, we aim to better understand income sorting in social networks inside cities and investigate how commuting distance conditions the online social ties of Twitter users in the 50 largest metropolitan areas of the United States. An above-median commuting distance in cities is linked to more diverse individual networks, moreover, we find that longer commutes are associated with a nearly uniform, moderate reduction of overall social tie assortativity across all cities. This suggests a universal relation between long-distance commutes and the integration of social networks. Our results inform policy that facilitating access across distant neighborhoods can advance the social inclusion of low-income groups.

<title>Who teaches and who learns? Policy learning through the C40 cities climate network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11077-012-9159-5</url>
<snippet>This study examines the network structure of policy learning in the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, which is a network of the world's largest cities committed to tackling climate change issues. Among forty members and nineteen affiliate members, we ask the question with whom do cities learn and why? How are policy-learning relationships associated with cities' multi-stakeholder governing body, policy performance, and cultural similarities? While studies on learning have analyzed conditions facilitating learning, quantitative studies of local government learning in global networks are rare. To facilitate the investigation into learning, we conceptualize learning as a process comprising information seeking, adoption and policy change, and focus on information seeking as the foundation step in the learning process. This social network analysis using the exponential random graph model reveals the cities that seek information and those that are information sources are different subgroups. Furthermore, analysis of nodal attributes suggests that transmunicipal learning in the C40 network is facilitated by the presence of a multi-stakeholder governing body; homophily of culture (language and regional proximity); and higher level of climate change policy performance. Creating a multi-stakeholder governing body could ensure participatory representativeness from citizens and relevant stakeholders to enhance climate change policy engagement and decision making as well as policy learning.

<snippet>Adolescent societieswhether arising from weak, short-term classroom friendships or from close, long-term friendshipsexhibit various levels of network clustering, segregation, and hierarchy. Some are rank-ordered caste systems and others are flat, cliquish worlds. Explaining the source of such structural variation remains a challenge, however, because global network features are generally treated as the agglomeration of micro-level tie-formation mechanisms, namely balance, homophily, and dominance. How do the same micro-mechanisms generate significant variation in global network structures? To answer this question we propose and test a network ecological theory that specifies the ways features of organizational environments moderate the expression of tie-formation processes, thereby generating variability in global network structures across settings. We develop this argument using longitudinal friendship data on schools (Add Health study) and classrooms (Classroom Engagement study), and by extending exponential random graph models to the study of multiple societies over time.

<title>The geographic embedding of online echo chambers: Evidence from the Brexit campaign</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0206841</url>
<snippet>This study explores the geographic dependencies of echo-chamber communication on Twitter during the Brexit campaign. We review the evidence positing that online interactions lead to filter bubbles to test whether echo chambers are restricted to online patterns of interaction or are associated with physical, in-person interaction. We identify the location of users, estimate their partisan affiliation, and finally calculate the distance between sender and receiver of @-mentions and retweets. We show that polarized online echo-chambers map onto geographically situated social networks. More specifically, our results reveal that echo chambers in the Leave campaign are associated with geographic proximity and that the reverse relationship holds true for the Remain campaign. The study concludes with a discussion of primary and secondary effects arising from the interaction between existing physical ties and online interactions and argues that the collapsing of distances brought by internet technologies may foreground the role of geography within one's social network.

<title>The Structure of Negative Social Ties in Rural Village Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.15195/v6.a8</url>
<snippet>Negative (antagonistic) connections have been of longstanding theoretical importance for social structure. In a population of 24,696 adults interacting face to face within 176 isolated villages in western Honduras, we measured all connections that were present, amounting to 105,175 positive and 16,448 negative ties. Here, we show that negative and positive ties exhibit many of the same structural characteristics. We then develop a complete taxonomy of all 138 possible triads of two-type relationships. Consistent with balance theory, we find that antagonists of friends and friends of antagonists tend to be antagonists; but, in an important empirical refutation of balance theory, we find that antagonists of antagonists also tend to be antagonists, not friends. Finally, villages with comparable levels of animosity tend to be geographically proximate. Similar processes, involving social contact, give rise to both positive and negative social ties in rural villages, and negative ties play an important role in social structure.

<title>The Early-Life Origins of Later-Life Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spaa047</url>
<snippet>Personal social networks profoundly influence a wide range of outcomes throughout the life course. But little research has considered how some features of individuals' social networks may be shaped by experiences in early life. This study uses nationally representative data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project to examine how childhood circumstances may shape the structure of older adults' personal social networks. The analyses show that higher childhood socioeconomic status is associated with larger network size and a more expansive, less kin-based network structure. At the same time, higher levels of family happiness in childhood are associated with greater network density and more kin-centric network composition, which may reflect greater access to social support and overall network intimacy across the life course. The results suggest that studies of the relative advantages of social network structure may benefit from contextualizing individuals' social networks in terms of their social origins. The article discusses the need for additional research on the life-course bases of the link between childhood circumstances and later-life network properties, and what role this connection plays in shaping later-life well-being.

It also illustrates the long-run knowledge distribution. Further, the model is embedded with new structural components that illustrate the strength of weak ties and the small-world phenomenon.

In this paper, we examine this theory by studying gender homophily in social networks of older adults. We document subjective social networks in multiple long term care settings for older adults over several time points. Homophily for each gender is estimated using exponential random graph models. We find evidence for positive homophily across all networks, and show that it is correlated to the magnitude of the female majority or male minority. Our findings empirically verify distinctiveness theory and could improve interventions to promote tie formation in social networks.

The purpose of this article is to interrogate this assumption: I identify when, how, and to what consequence digital networks are similar to and different from other kinds of social networks and thereby attempt to strengthen the available theoretical scaffolding for this important and rapidly growing body of work.

<title>Network formation in organizational settings: Exploring the importance of local social processes and team-level contextual variables in small groups using bayesian hierarchical ERGMs</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.07.001</url>
<snippet>Statistical models for social networks, such as exponential random graphs (ERGMs), have increasingly been used by organizational scholars to study the social interactions inside organizations, departments, and teams. While such models have been successful in providing insights about the local processes that underlie these interactions (such as homophily, reciprocity or transitivity), an additional interesting avenue for research focuses on the role of group -level contextual variables (such as the climate or composition of a team or organization) when considering a multitude of teams or organizations. In this paper we show how, in a team context, integrating team -level factors in a multilevel framework (i.e., a Bayesian hierarchical ERGM) enables us to answer questions about: 1) how team -level contextual factors might provide alternative explanations for the emergence of intra-team ties, and 2) whether any variation in local tendencies between teams might be dependent on such team -level variables (i.e., cross -level interactions). Using data collected among 103 MBA students who were grouped into 18 teams of 5-7 members to work on a project, we study the impact of members' expertise and perceived psychological safety on advice seeking behavior. At a local level, we focus on the effect of these nodal attributes for homophily and differences in advice seeking and giving, while at the team level we incorporate the average expertise and the team's psychological safety climate. Our results show that expert members are more likely to be the recipient of advice ties, but also that this effect is more pronounced in teams where the overall level of expertise is high. For psychological safety, we find that a high psychological safety climate impacts the advice relations among all members in the group, not solely those who themselves perceive a high level of psychological safety, suggesting that the team climate has an impact on all its members. This illustrates how a Bayesian hierarchical ERGM allows us to obtain relevant results even when studying small -sized groups.

<title>A model for the multiplex dynamics of two-mode and one-mode networks, with an application to employment preference, friendship, and advice</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2012.05.005</url>
<snippet>We propose a new stochastic actor-oriented model for the co-evolution of two-mode and one-mode networks. The model posits that activities of a set of actors, represented in the two-mode network, co-evolve with exchanges and interactions between the actors, as represented in the one-mode network. The model assumes that the actors, not the activities, have agency. The empirical value of the model is demonstrated by examining how employment preferences co-evolve with friendship and advice relations in a group of seventy-five MBA students. The analysis shows that activity in the two-mode network, as expressed by number of employment preferences, is related to activity in the friendship network, as expressed by outdegrees. Further, advice ties between students lead to agreement with respect to employment preferences. In addition, considering the multiplexity of advice and friendship ties yields a better understanding of the dynamics of the advice relation: tendencies to reciprocation and homophily in advice relations are mediated to an important extent by friendship relations. The discussion pays attention to the implications of this study in the broader context of current efforts to model the co-evolutionary dynamics of social networks and individual behavior.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-024-00485-y</url>
<snippet>The Ego Network Model (ENM) is a model for the structural organisation of relationships, rooted in evolutionary anthropology, that is found ubiquitously in social contexts. It takes the perspective of a single user (Ego) and organises their contacts (Alters) into a series of (typically 5) concentric circles of decreasing intimacy and increasing size. Alters are sorted based on their tie strength to the Ego, however, this is difficult to measure directly. Traditionally, the interaction frequency has been used as a proxy but this misses the qualitative aspects of connections, such as signs (i.e. polarity), which have been shown to provide extremely useful information. However, the sign of an online social relationship is usually an implicit piece of information, which needs to be estimated by interaction data from Online Social Networks (OSNs), making sign prediction in OSNs a research challenge in and of itself. This work aims to bring the ENM into the signed networks domain by investigating the interplay of signed connections with the ENM. This paper delivers 2 main contributions. Firstly, a new and data-efficient method of signing relationships between individuals using sentiment analysis and, secondly, we provide an in-depth look at the properties of Signed Ego Networks (SENs), using 9 Twitter datasets of various categories of users. We find that negative connections are generally over-represented in the active part of the Ego Networks, suggesting that Twitter greatly over-emphasises negative relationships with respect to "offline" social networks. Further, users who use social networks for professional reasons have an even greater share of negative connections. Despite this, we also found weak signs that less negative users tend to allocate more cognitive effort to individual relationships and thus have smaller ego networks on average. All in all, even though structurally ENMs are known to be similar in both offline and online social networks, our results indicate that relationships on Twitter tend to nurture more negativity than offline contexts.

<title>Homophily Among Good Friends. Close and Weak Friendships Between Children With Migration Background and Native Peers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Modifying M. Granovetters distinction between strong and weak tie friendships, social assimilation of immigrant children will be investigated from a social network perspective. Using data from primary school classes we start from the assumption that particularly close friendships have a positive impact on the process of acculturation. We investigate the role of ethnic homophily in the formation of weak and close friendships between immigrant and native children. In doing so, alternative explanations of friendship formation like social homophily as a mediator of ethnic homophily will be considered measured by similarity of ego and alter in terms of cultural capital "in the objectified state". As a result, immigrant children of Turkish origin have friendships with native peers, but these connections tend to be rather weak tie relations. Dyads of two Turkish children, in contrast, chances of close friendships are higher. It will be argued that these results are in line with the concept of selective acculturation of immigrant children of Turkish origin.

<title>The ties that bind global governance: Using media-reported events to disentangle the global interorganizational network in a global pandemic</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.02.012</url>
<snippet>This article disentangles the global interorganizational network by analyzing the ties of international actors comprising multinational companies, intergovernmental organizations, and international nongovernmental organizations. The onset of COVID-19 is a rare opportunity to explore how this network has evolved in an exogenous event. Using a unique GDELT big dataset of events reported by the world's media, we extract and analyze the interorganizational interactions of international actors before and after the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the COVID-19 outbreak was a public health emergency of international concern. Adopting an exploratory and descriptive approach at multiple levels of analysis, we draw on the theory of networks to uncover the fragmented, polycentric, and complex characteristics of the global interorganizational network. Our study highlights the use of media-reported events and the Goldstein scale as means to unpack the difficult-to-capture relational dynamics of international actors, which can help in theory development of the global interorganizational network that is crucial for collective action to address societal grand challenges.

<title>Spatial Modeling Approach for Dynamic Network Formation and Interactions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2019.1639395</url>
<snippet>This study primarily seeks to answer the following question: How do social networks evolve over time and affect individual economic activity? To provide an adequate empirical tool to answer this question, we propose a new modeling approach for longitudinal data of networks and activity outcomes. The key features of our model are the inclusion of dynamic effects and the use of time-varying latent variables to determine unobserved individual traits in network formation and activity interactions. The proposed model combines two well-known models in the field: latent space model for dynamic network formation and spatial dynamic panel data model for network interactions. This combination reflects real situations, where network links and activity outcomes are interdependent and jointly influenced by unobserved individual traits. Moreover, this combination enables us to (1) manage the endogenous selection issue inherited in network interaction studies, and (2) investigate the effect of homophily and individual heterogeneity in network formation. We develop a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling approach to estimate the model. We also provide a Monte Carlo experiment to analyze the performance of our estimation method and apply the model to a longitudinal student network data in Taiwan to study the friendship network formation and peer effect on academic performance. for this article are available online.

<title>Social context, spatial structure and social network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2010.09.002</url>
<snippet>Frequently, social networks are studied in their own right with analyses devoid of contextual details. Yet contextual features - both social and spatial - can have impacts on the networks formed within them. This idea is explored with five empirical networks representing different contexts and the use of distinct modeling strategies. These strategies include network visualizations, QAP regression, exponential random graph models, blockmodeling and a combination of blockmodels with exponential random graph models within a single framework. We start with two empirical examples of networks inside organizations. The familiar Bank Wiring Room data show that the social organization (social context) and spatial arrangement of the room help account for the social relations formed there. The second example comes from a police academy where two designed arrangements, one social and one spatial, powerfully determine the relational social structures formed by recruits. The next example is an inter-organizational network that emerged as part of a response to a natural disaster where features of the improvised context helped account for the relations that formed between organizations participating in the search and rescue mission. We then consider an anthropological example of signed relations among sub-tribes in the New Guinea highlands where the physical geography is fixed. This is followed by a trading network off the Dalmatian coast where geography and physical conditions matter. Through these examples, we show that context matters by shaping the structure of networks that form and that a variety of network analytic tools can be mobilized to reveal how networks are shaped, in part, by social and spatial contexts. Implications for studying social networks are suggested. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Teammate invitation networks: The roles of recommender systems and prior collaboration in team assembly</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.04.008</url>
<snippet>Teammate invitation networks are foundational for team assembly, and recommender systems (similar to dating websites, but for selecting potential teammates) can aid the formation of such networks. This paper extends Hinds et al.'s (2000) influential model of team member selection by incorporating online recommender systems. Exponential random graph modeling of two samples (overall N = 410; 63 teams; 1,048 invitations) shows the invitation network is predicted by online recommendations, beyond previously-established effects of prior collaboration/familiarity, skills/competence, and homophily. Importantly, online recommendations are less heeded when there is prior collaboration (this effect replicates across samples). This study highlights technologyenabled team assembly from a network perspective.

<title>Life course similarities on social networking sites</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2016.04.002</url>
<snippet>Dyadic social relations are known to exhibit homophily - attraction and bonding between similar individuals - and recent studies have detected homophily also on the social network level. Here, we investigate whether social media networks exhibit signs of homophily with regards to life stages. Using a large and global database (N = 111,863) of social media profile pictures, we investigate proportions of picture types in an individual's social network. Typical stages of young adulthood include peer group formation, mate searching, union formation, and parenting. We studied to what extent different association categories with pictures of one or several individuals correlated with each other. Results showed that users with a profile picture of a single individual were more likely to have other profile pictures of single individuals of the opposite sex, but not of the same sex, in their social media network. Profile pictures of heterosexual couples were more likely to appear with other heterosexual couple pictures, and profiles with baby pictures were strongly associated with the frequency of other baby pictures within the same network; both of these types were negatively associated with the frequency of pictures of singles. Pictures of two females together were positively linked with the largest number of other association types. The results probably reflect both selection and contagion effects. We conclude that contemporary social media networks appear to exhibit homophily in displays related to mate searching, pair bonds, and the transition to parenthood. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

<title>Network ecology: Tie fitness in social context(s)</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.11.002</url>
<snippet>Social relations are embedded in material, cultural, and institutional settings that affect network dynamics and the resulting topologies. For example, romantic entanglements are subject to social and cultural norms, interfirm alliances are constrained by country -specific legislation, and adolescent friendships are conditioned by classroom settings and neighborhood effects. In short, social contexts shape social relations and the networks they give rise to. However, how and when they do so remain to be established. This paper presents network ecology as a general framework for identifying how the proximal environment shapes social networks by focusing interactions and social relations, and how these interactions and relations in turn shape the environment in which social networks form. Tie fitness is introduced as a metric that quantifies how well particular dyadic social relations would align with the setting. Using longitudinal networks collected on two cohorts each in 18 North American schools, i.e., 36 settings, we develop five generalizable observations about the time -varying fitness of adolescent friendship. Across all 252 analyzed networks, tie fitness predicted new tie formation, tie longevity, and tie survival. Dormant fit ties cluster in relational niches, thereby establishing a resource base for social identities competing for increased representation in the relational system.

<title>Social Homophily in Middle School. Friendships and Enmities between Socially Distant Students in four French Middle Schools</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Most studies of degrees of social mix in middle school focus on individual schools' socio-occupational composition (i.e., the socio-occupational statuses of their students' parents). But little is known about relations between students within socially mixed schools. One question that arises in this connection is social homophily; i.e., the propensity to have friends of social backgrounds close to one's own. This article analyses the social networks of 861 students from their first to fourth years of middle school in four French schools characterized by strong social mix. It measures the impact of sociooccupational background on their friendships and enmities and compares that to the impacts of other homophily factors (gender, grades [academic performance], migrant status and, if applicable, migrant origin). It finds, first, that social homophily does exist in middle school and is more pronounced for strong friendships and friendships that extend beyond the school environment than for those confined to it. Second, social background does not seem to have a significant effect on student enmities. Third, homophily strength varies considerably from one school to another, suggesting an important role for local school context.

<title>Personal network dynamics across the life course: A relationship-related structural approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2023.100567</url>
<snippet>Building on Georg Simmel's concept of "form", the article presents a relationship related structural concept of social relationships that specifically accounts for opportunities and constraints resulting from the fact that relationships are solidified patterns of interaction that, once established, can develop a power of their own (inertia, momentum) that cannot easily be influenced by the involved actors. In this "relationship-related structural approach", social relationships or "forms" can be understood as specific constellations of "basic structural properties", i.e. specifications of various aspects of quantity, of time, of space, of similarity, and including also a certain degree of freedom to enter or quit a relationship, knowledge about one another, and types and degree of institutionalization. The specification of these structural properties impacts the functional capacity of relationships, as well as the dynamics of both relationships and networks, especially the ways in which relationships are formed, maintained, or lost. Referring to various life course transitions from different phases of the life course, it is demonstrated how this approach helps to better understand the dynamics of social relationships and networks and the impact of life events on personal relationships across the life course. Finally, implications of this novel perspective for life course and network research are discussed.

<title>Homophily Through Nonreciprocity: Results of an Experiment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/sos065</url>
<snippet>This study outlines a new explanation for homophily in social networks that is neither intended nor imposed by constraints on partner choices. Rather, homophily is an endogenous product of the emergent exchange process, in which actors seek high-value partners who reciprocate their gestures. Whereas all actors initially direct exchange toward higher value partners, the gestures of lower value actors are more likely to go unreciprocated. This imbalance drives lower value actors to seek new partners, who end up being others who are also lower value. The consequence is homophily on value despite no such preference. I draw upon social exchange theory to articulate how this process unfolds in a newly forming network. A laboratory experiment tests hypotheses about how exchange patterns change over time. Findings reveal that shifts in participants' behavior over time were consistent with a concern for reciprocity, resulting in increasing levels of homophily in the network.

<title>Not all brokers are alike: Creative implications of brokering networks in different work functions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0018726716672921</url>
<snippet>Brokers are expected to be more creative than employees embedded in closed social structures because they occupy a position in the social space that provides them with access to non-redundant knowledge. However, the extant research provides partly inconsistent findings on the creative implications of brokerage, which raises important questions about when and how brokering between otherwise disconnected colleagues leads to individual creativity. We advance the relational perspective on individual creativity by adopting a contingency view, and showing that a curvilinear ( inverted U-shape) specification of the relationship between brokerage and creativity applies particularly when brokers work in research and development, as they are more likely to intensively exploit their structural opportunities. In addition, we show that brokers who work in research and development are more sensitive to work environments that protect their cognitive resources, such that they exhibit greater creativity when the work environment is free from environmental stressors, such as noise and disturbances. Thus, environmental stressors are particularly harmful for those employees who are most likely to exploit the opportunity to broker across otherwise disconnected colleagues.

<title>Who Received Informal Social Support During the First COVID-19 Lockdown in Germany, and Who Did Not? The Role of Social Networks, Life Course and Pandemic-Specific Risks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-022-02890-0</url>
<snippet>In this article, we study the receipt of informal support during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The containment measures have had various, far-reaching consequences for the wellbeing of people, creating demands for economic, practical, and emotional support-even among individuals who hitherto were not in need of support. Existing research has shown substantial levels of informal support during the pandemic, often based on individuals' existing social networks, but has predominantly taken the perspective of donors. In this article, we focus on the "demand" or recipient "side" of informal support, and ask: (1) Who receives which type of informal social support during the pandemic? (2) Who reports unmet need? (3) Which factors explain support receipt, unmet need and the type of support received? To explain patterns of receiving social support, we identify "classic" life course and "new" pandemic-specific risks and complement this perspective with individuals' support potentials from their social networks. Empirically, we use data from an online survey, collected among a quota sample of the German population (n = 4,496) at the end of the first lockdown in late spring 2020. Our analysis shows that one in six respondents received social support, while only 3&#37; report unmet need. Practical and emotional support are most widespread. Using logistic and multinomial logistic regression models our results show that social support in general and the type of support received can be explained by life course and pandemic risks, while unmet need is mainly a consequence of social network structure.

<title>The Network Dynamics of Status: Assimilation and Selection</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/sox040</url>
<snippet>Using longitudinal data that we have collected on friendship and advice relations in a cohort of MBA students, we examine how status affects the dynamics of network ties among peers. Estimates of Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs) suggest that status is a consequence of network ties because over time the level of status attributed to individual students by other students tends to the average level of status attributed to their network partners-a phenomenon we call status assimilation. Status is also an antecedent to network ties because it affects partner selection decisions, giving rise to distinct forms of social attachment. We find that both network-based processes of status assimilation, as well as status-based processes of social selection, are present, but they vary subtly yet significantly across network domains. Students tend to the average level of status of their friends, but not to that of their advisors. High-status students are more active in the friendship network, but more popular in the advice network. We find evidence of performance homophily rather than status homophily: students with similar grades are more likely to exchange friendship and advice ties. High-status students tend to be more central in the advice network, but status attributions spill over through friendship, rather than advice relations. The study documents how the relation between social status and social networks varies both over time, as well as across network domains. The study also demonstrates the importance of accounting for multiplexity-the tendency of a network to operate through another.

<title>Ukrainian refugees struggling to integrate into Czech school social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01880-y</url>
<snippet>We provide a brief insight into the integration of Ukrainian refugees in school social networks in the Czech Republic following the mass migration caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Our sample contains twelve classrooms with a total of 266 students in grades 5 to 9; 21.05&#37; of the students were of Ukrainian origin. We employed multiplex exponential random graph modelling to assess the level to which Ukrainian refugees were integrated within peer networks, capturing both friendship and exclusion ties. We then employed a meta-analytical procedure to aggregate the results from the individual classrooms and a meta-regression to study the relationship between classroom ethnic composition and the level of integration of Ukrainian refugees. We found social networks to be formed heavily along ethnic lines with strong ethnic homophily in friendship ties and a propensity of the Ukrainian students to both send and receive fewer friendship ties than their Czech classmates. We found no evidence that the Ukrainian students sent or received more exclusion ties than their Czech classmates, suggesting that the Ukrainian students did not face explicit rejection from classmates; rather, we saw a tendency of the Ukrainian students to be neglected. Our findings stand in contrast to reports from school headmasters who asserted that the social integration of Ukrainian students was seamless. We further found a higher proportion of Ukrainian students in classrooms to be related to stronger homophilic behaviour and a lower tendency of Ukrainian students to make friends. Our results therefore imply that increased classroom diversity may negatively influence the integration of refugees in social networks.

<title>Finding College Student Social Networks by Mining the Records of Student ID Transactions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym11030307</url>
<snippet>Information about college students' social networks plays a pivotal role in college students' mental health monitoring and student management. While there have been many studies to infer social networks by data mining, the mining of college students' social networks lacks consideration of homophily. College students' social behaviors show significant homophily in the aspect of major and grade. Consequently, the inferred inter-major and inter-grade social ties will be erroneously omitted without considering such an effect. In this work, we aimed to increase the fidelity of the extracted networks by alleviating the homophily effect. To achieve this goal, we propose a method that combines the sliding time-window method with the hierarchical encounter model based on association rules. Specifically, we first calculated the counts of spatial-temporal co-occurrences of each student pair. The co-occurrences were acquired by the sliding time-window method, which takes advantage of the symmetry of the social ties. We then applied the hierarchical encounter model based on association rules to extract social networks by layer. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive method to set co-occurrence thresholds. Results suggested that our model infers the social networks of students with better fidelity, with the proportion of extracted inter-major social ties in entire social ties increasing from 0.89&#37; to 5.45&#37; and the proportion of inter-grade social ties rising from 0.92&#37; to 4.65&#37;.

<title>Three dimensions of the public sphere on Facebook</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1281329</url>
<snippet>The article provides an empirical analysis of the online public sphere in the three dimensions introduced by Dahlgren (2005): structural, representational and interactional. The main subject of analysis is the largest social networking site - Facebook - and Polish users' activity on the Facebook Pages of political parties and politicians. The researchers analysed data about all users active on those Pages during two 4-month periods in 2013 and 2015. The results of the study show that only a small fraction of Facebook users are active in public political discussions that take place on political Facebook Pages (structural dimension). However, the level of engagement depends on the current political events taking place within the public sphere offline, and users are more active during electoral campaigns. Moreover, Facebook does not provide an alternative public sphere for political actors that are less present in mainstream media. Parties and politicians that are visible in traditional media are also attracting active fans in social media (representational dimension). Nonetheless, non-parliamentary groups have more active fans than would result only from their popularity in mainstream media. Finally, the online public on Facebook is fragmented and clustered into homogenous political groups (interactional dimension), thus supporting the hypothesis on echo chambers' presented by Sunstein (2001). The divisions are smaller when there are significantly more users involved. However, most of these cross-cutting links are the result of the electoral campaign.

<title>Geographical variability and network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2011.08.003</url>
<snippet>In this paper, we explore the potential implications of geographical variability for the structure of social networks. Beginning with some basic simplifying assumptions, we derive a number of ways in which local network structure should be expected to vary across a region whose population is unevenly distributed. To examine the manner in which these effects would be expected to manifest given realistic population distributions, we then perform an exploratory simulation study that examines the features of large-scale interpersonal networks generated using block-level data from the 2000 U.S. Census. Using a stratified sample of micropolitan and metropolitan areas with populations ranging from approximately 1000 to 1,000,000 persons, we extrapolatively simulate network structure using spatial network models calibrated to two fairly proximate social relations. From this sample of simulated networks, we examine the effect of both within-location and between-location heterogeneity on a variety of structural properties. As we demonstrate, geographical variability produces large and distinctive features in the "social fabric" that overlies it; at the same time, however, many aggregate network properties can be fairly well-predicted from relatively simple spatial demographic variables. The impact of geographical variability is thus predicted to depend substantially on the type of network property being assessed, and on the spatial scale involved. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

<snippet>We consider linked lives through the Convoy Model of Social Relations to illustrate their complexity, consequences, and development across contexts. To illustrate how the Convoy Model lens provides a unique opportunity to examine the multidimensional and dynamic character of linked lives across time and space, we analyze twenty-three years of longitudinal data from the Social Relations Study (SRS). The SRS is a regionally representative Detroit-area sample (N=1,498) with three waves (1992; 2005; 2015) of data from community dwelling people age 13 to 93. We present three illustrative examples of linked lives: 1) the influence of earlier life social network characteristics (size and closeness) on later life health outcomes; 2) the influence of social position (race and education) on relationship quality with spouse/partner and child over time; and 3) the influence of transitioning from working to retirement on network structure (size and geographic proximity). Findings illustrate linked lives through multiple instances of social relationships and as influenced by various contexts. Further, the consequences of linked lives for mental health are consistent across the life course while influence on physical health is variable. The Convoy Model presents key concepts to situate the ways in which linked lives form and function at various levels and across multiple contexts to have far reaching effects on life outcomes.

<title>Trust Thy Crooked Neighbor: Multiplexity in Chicago Organized Crime Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122416650149</url>
<snippet>Bureaucratic and patrimonial theories of organized crime tend to miss the history and mobility of crime groups integrating into and organizing with legitimate society. The network property of multiplexitywhen more than one type of relationship exists between a pair of actorsoffers a theoretical and empirical inroad to analyzing overlapping relationships of seemingly disparate social spheres. Using the historical case of organized crime in Chicago and a unique relational database coded from more than 5,000 pages of archival documents, we map the web of multiplex relationships among bootleggers, politicians, union members, businessmen, families, and friends. We analyze the overlap of criminal, personal, and legitimate networks containing 1,030 individuals and 3,726 mutual dyads between them. Multiplexity is rare in these data: only 10 percent of the mutual dyads contain multiplex ties. However, results from bivariate exponential random graph models demonstrate that multiplexity is a relevant structural property binding the three networks together. Even among our sample of criminals, we find dependencies between the criminal and personal networks and the criminal and legitimate networks. Although not pervasive, multiplexity glued these worlds of organized crime together above and beyond the personalities of famous gangsters, ethnic homophily, and other endogenous network processes.

<title>Individual personality predicts social network assemblages in a colonial bird</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-29315-3</url>
<snippet>Animal personalities manifest as consistent individual differences in the performance of specific behavioural expressions. Personality research has implications for zoo animal welfare, as it can further our understanding of how captive individuals may differ in their resource use and provide insight into improving individual and group social health. For group living species, personality may enable assortment based on similar behaviour and influence an individual's interactions with conspecifics (e.g. social support). This research aimed to document how personality traits (aggressive, exploratory, submissive) influenced the social network structure of highly social animals in a captive environment. Data were collected from separate flocks of captive Caribbean (Phoenicopterus ruber) and Chilean flamingos (Phoenicopterus chilensis) to identify relationships between birds and examine opportunities for social support. The flocks associated non-randomly, and in both cases, personality was a substantial predictor of network structure. Personality also predicted key elements of Caribbean flamingo social role (degree, betweenness and average association strength) conflict outcome, and propensity to provide social support, however these patterns were not replicated within the Chilean flamingo network. While both species appear to assort by personality, the broader relationship between personality and social role may vary depending on species and context.

<title>The Ethnic Lens: Social Networks and the Salience of Ethnicity in the School Context</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.15195/v10.a22</url>
<snippet>Research on ethnic segregation in schools regularly assumed that ethnic homophily-the tendency to befriend same-ethnic peers, above and beyond other mechanisms of tie formation-is associated with salient ethnic boundaries. We devise a more direct test of this assumption based on a novel measure of ethno-racial group perceptions. In a network study of more than 3000 students in 39 schools of a metropolitan region in Germany, we asked students to indicate which cliques they perceived in their school grade and to describe these groups in their own words. We find that ethno-racial labels are more likely directed at larger cliques that include a higher share of Muslim students or more students with stronger ethnic identification. Still, ethno-racial labels are rarely employed, both absolutely and relative to other modes of classification. Moreover, net ethnic segregation in friendships ("ethnic homophily") and the reverse pattern in dislike relations ("ethnic heterophobia") are not associated with a more frequent use of ethno-racial labels. Our results have substantive and methodological implications for the study of social networks and diversity in educational settings.

<title>Connected seniors: how older adults in East York exchange social support online and offline</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1305428</url>
<snippet>How do older adults mobilize social support, with and without digital media? To investigate this, we focus on older adults 65+ residing in the Toronto locality of East York, using 42 interviews lasting about 90 minutes done in 2013-2014. We find that digital media help in mobilizing social support as well as maintaining and strengthening existing relationships with geographically near and distant contacts. This is especially important for those individuals (and their network members) who have limited mobility. Once older adults start using digital media, they become routinely incorporated into their lives, used in conjunction with the telephone to maintain existing relationships but not to develop new ones. Contradicting fears that digital media are inadequate for meaningful relational contact, we found that these older adults considered social support exchanged via digital media to be real support that cannot be dismissed as token. Older adults especially used and valued digital media for companionship. They also used them for coordination, maintaining ties, and casual conversations. Email was used more with friends than relatives; some Skype was used with close family ties. Our research suggests that policy efforts need to emphasize the strengthening of existing networks rather than the establishment of interventions that are outside of older adults' existing ties. Our findings also show that learning how to master technology is in itself a form of social support that provides opportunities to strengthen the networks of older adults.

<title>Network dynamics of television use in school classes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2011.08.002</url>
<snippet>Seventy years ago Paul Lazarsfeld and colleagues found empirical evidence for a significant influence of the social context on media effects by interpersonal communication. Subsequently various theories in mass media science incorporated the social context as an independent or dependent variable. However, there is little empirical research that addresses the dynamics of media use within a social context using network analytic methods. This study considers the social context as both an independent and dependent variable in a dynamic network process in order to disentangle social selection and influence processes. Hence, on one hand it tests whether the intensity of TV use and the use of specific TV genres predict the selection of conversation partners in social groups (social selection process). On the other hand it tests if individuals' social context predicts their TV use (social influence process). Here, social context is defined as the conversation structure as well as the media use of all other persons in the social group. The research design includes a four wave panel survey on interpersonal communication networks and TV use of 707 students (age 13-16) in 29 Swiss school classes. The stochastic actor-based models tested with the program SIENA support the hypothesized selection processes. Conversation partners about TV programs are selected according to the similarity of their TV use. In contrast to this finding, the widely held assumption that individuals are influenced by their social network is not supported. Some inconclusive evidences suggest a possible social influence process on the level of TV intensity but not on the level of specific TV genres. Network-autocorrelation of conversation ties and TV use has therefore primarily be accredited to social selection processes and not social influence. Furthermore, the results show that avid viewers tend to talk more often about TV programs (ego effect), that avid viewers are more likely to be addressed (alter effect), and a general tendency to talk to persons with the same program preference (similarity effect). This challenges the classic idea of a two-step flow of communication in which intensive media users which are well informed would provide information to occasional users which are less conversant with a topic.

<title>Exponential random graph models and pendant-triangle statistics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2024.07.002</url>
<snippet>The paper builds on the framework proposed by Pattison and Snijders (2012) for specifying exponential random graph models (ERGMs) for social networks. We briefly review the two-dimensional hierarchy of potential dependence structures for network tie variables that they outlined and provide proofs of the relationships among the model forms and of the nature of their sufficient statistics, noting that models in the hierarchy have the potential to reflect the outcome of processes of cohesion, closure, boundary and bridge formation and path creation over short or longer network distances. We then focus on the so-called partial inclusion dependence assumptions among network tie variables and the pendant-triangle, or paw, statistics to which they give rise, and illustrate their application in an empirical setting. We argue that the partial inclusion assumption leads to models that can reflect processes of boundary and bridge formation and that the model hierarchy provides a broad and useful framework for the statistical analysis of network data. We demonstrate in the chosen setting that pendant- triangle (or paw) effects, in particular, lead to a marked improvement in goodness-of-fit and hence add a potentially valuable capacity for modelling social networks.

<title>School Choice or Schools' Choice? Managing in an Era of Accountability</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0038040710375688</url>
<snippet>Drawing on a year and a half of ethnographic research in three New York City small high schools, this study examines the role of the school in managing school choice and asks what social processes are associated with principals' disparate approaches. Although district policy did not allow principals to select students based on their performance, two of the three schools in this study circumvented these rules to recruit and retain a population that would meet local accountability targets. This article brings together sensemaking and social network theories to offer a theoretical account of schools' management of choice in an era of accountability. In doing so, the author demonstrates that principals' sensemaking about the accountability and choice systems occurred within the interorganizational networks in which they were embedded and was strongly conditioned by their own professional biographies and worldviews. Principals' networks offered access to resources that could be activated to make sense of the accountability and choice systems. How principals perceived accountability and choice policies influenced whether they activated their social networks for assistance in strategically managing the choice process, as well as how they made sense of advice available to them through these networks. Once activated, principals' networks provided uneven access to instrumental and expressive resources. Taken together, these results suggest that schools respond to accountability and choice plans in varied ways that are not simply a function of their short-term incentives.

<title>Misery Does Not Love Company: Network Selection Mechanisms and Depression Homophily</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122411420813</url>
<snippet>Conventional wisdom holds that friends protect against depression through the social support they provide; however, depression likely has a role in structuring friendship networks. In particular, we investigate friend selection mechanisms responsible for similarity in depression among friends (i.e., homophily). Preference is one explanation, yet several correlates of depression make homophilous selection among depressed individuals unlikely. We propose two alternative mechanisms-avoidance and withdrawal-that can produce depression homophily in the absence of preference. These alternative mechanisms create homophily indirectly by limiting friendship partners available to depressed individuals. We test the preference, avoidance, and withdrawal mechanisms using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and a dynamic network model. Results provide support for the withdrawal mechanism. These findings help explain how depression affects friend selection and have broader implications for understanding selection mechanisms responsible for network patterns such as homophily.

<title>Crafting Mosaics: Person-Centered Religious Influence and Selection in Adolescent Friendships</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12638</url>
<snippet>This research addresses the intersection of two key domains of adolescents' lives: religion and peer networks. Religion scholars argue that religion is multi-faceted and better understood by focusing on combinations of indicators (i.e., mosaics), versus a variable-centered approach. We adopt this framework and investigate the interplay between religion and peer networks, both in how religious mosaics are shaped by friends and how religious profiles affect friend selection dynamics. With data from two schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate religious mosaics using latent class analysis (LCA) to identify profiles consisting of combinations of commonly available survey-based measures of religious attitudes, behaviors, and identities. Finding evidence of theoretically expected profiles, we then use stochastic actor-based models (SABMs) to investigate network dynamics for these LCA-based religious profiles. We demonstrate how the profile data can be integrated within the SABM framework to evaluate processes of friend selection and influence. Results show evidence of adolescents influencing one another's religious mosaics, but not selecting friends on that basis.

<title>How conversational ties are formed in an online community: a social network analysis of a tweet chat group</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1581242</url>
<snippet>This paper examines the generative processes underlying the conversational network structure of a tweet chat community (#dsma, 'Diabetes Social Media Advocacy'). Taking a relational perspective to the study of mediated communication, this paper uses social network analysis and treats conversational ties as the unit of analysis. It explores the formation of such ties in a multitheoretical, multilevel framework via exponential random graph modeling (ERGM). Twitter network data on #dsma from a two-year period (2015-2017) were analyzed. Results showed that similar to offline relationship formation observed in previous research, this online conversational community also emerged from a combination of social processes (including attribute-based social selection and endogenous network self-organization) that occurred at individual, dyadic, and triadic levels. This study contributes empirical insights into relational dynamics underlying online networks and encourages future research on mediated communication as an emergent, interdependent process involving multifaceted, multilevel mechanisms.

<title>Resilient Homophily Patterns in Youth Friendship Networks: A Case Study Using a Computer Simulation Experiment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.5477/cis/reis.177.43</url>
<snippet>This paper deals with how to recognise if the patterns of homophily found in a social network are resilient to small disturbances that may occur in that network. Data from a survey of students in a secondary school in the Canary Islands were replicated using an agent-based model. The model calculated homophily indexes and their statistical significance and then simulated small alterations in the distribution of links. The results clearly show that some homophily indexes resist these kinds of perturbations and others do not. Evidence suggests that the distribution of individuals across the social network communities is a key factor in explaining why certain patterns of relationships are more resilient than others.

<title>Tackling connections, structure, and meaning in networks: quantitative and qualitative methods in sociological network research</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-011-9492-3</url>
<snippet>The paper systematizes the role of qualitative methods, statistical analyses, and formal network analysis in sociological network research, and argues for their systematic combination. Formal network analysis mainly aims at a description of network structures as well as at an explanation of the behavior of the network at the systemic level. Formal network analysis can also be used in order to explain individual behavior or the existence of individual connections from network structure. Statistical analyses of ego-centered networks are used to correlate individual attributes with the structure and composition of the individual embeddedness, thus providing a statistical explanation of network effects and determinants. Qualitative methods are important for exploring network structures, and for understanding the meaning connected to them. A historical overview shows that these three strands have long co-existed in sociological network research without engaging in combined research efforts. Combinations of these methods prove useful when considering the various aspects of networks (individual connections, structural patterns, and meaning).

<title>Interactions, Actors, and Time: Dynamic Network Actor Models for Relational Events</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.15195/v4.a14</url>
<snippet>Ample theoretical work on social networks is explicitly or implicitly concerned with the role of interpersonal interaction. However, empirical studies to date mostly focus on the analysis of stable relations. This article introduces Dynamic Network Actor Models (DyNAMs) for the study of directed, interpersonal interaction through time. The presented model addresses three important aspects of interpersonal interaction. First, interactions unfold in a larger social context and depend on complex structures in social systems. Second, interactions emanate from individuals and are based on personal preferences, restricted by the available interaction opportunities. Third, sequences of interactions develop dynamically, and the timing of interactions relative to one another contains useful information. We refer to these aspects as the network nature, the actor-oriented nature, and the dynamic nature of social interaction. A case study compares the DyNAM framework to the relational event model, a widely used statistical method for the study of social interaction data.

<snippet>In this paper, we harness server-side data-540,000 messages generated by 2085 users on TamTamy, an Enterprise Social Media (ESM) platform-to examine how gender and rank shaped "homophily" (the tendency to connect with similar others) and centrality in an ESM network. Drawing on the logic of "distinctiveness theory," which argues that the numeric rarity of a category in a given setting promotes the use of that category as a basis for connecting with others, we hypothesized and found: (a) the tendency to connect with same-gender others was stronger among women than among men; (b) the tendency to connect with same-rank others was stronger among high-ranking employees than among low-ranking employees;
