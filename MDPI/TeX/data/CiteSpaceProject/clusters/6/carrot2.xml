<title>China's non-ferrous metal recycling technology convergence and driving factors: A quadratic assignment procedure analysis based on patent collaboration-based network structural hole</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0271694</url>
<snippet>Technological convergence is an important organizational innovation capability, essential for improving the core competitiveness of green and sustainable industries. However, studies have mainly focused on measuring technological convergence and have ignored the factors that affect the capabilities of such convergence capabilities. Thus, this study attempts to bridge this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of the impact of structural holes in inter-organizational technical cooperation networks. This technological convergence is studied from the perspective of a patent. It also considers the moderating effects of the degree of patent cooperation and the cooperation distance. It employs the social network theory to construct inter-organizational patent cooperation, and technological convergence networks, to facilitate the analysis of the effect of structural holes on such a convergence. It empirically examines 52 non-ferrous metal recycling organizations, with close patent cooperation. Accordingly, the structural hole constraint index by the inter-organizational patent cooperation network, shows a positive U-shaped curve relationship with technology convergence. Moreover, the degree of inter-organizational patent cooperation strengthens the positive U-shaped relationship, and the distance of cooperation weakens the influence of the structural hole constraint index on technology convergence. Therefore, managers and policymakers should encourage more industry-academia-research or patent alliances and designate policies to promote such cooperation.

<title>Learning Dynamics in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA18659</url>
<snippet>This paper proposes a tractable model of Bayesian learning on large random networks where agents choose whether to adopt an innovation. We study the impact of the network structure on learning dynamics and product diffusion. In directed networks, all direct and indirect links contribute to agents' learning. In comparison, learning and welfare are lower in undirected networks and networks with cliques. In a rich class of networks, behavior is described by a small number of differential equations, making the model useful for empirical work.

<title>Social Network Dynamics and Biographical Disruption: The Case of "First-Timers" with Mental Illness</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/666377</url>
<snippet>This study examines how dynamics surrounding biographical disruptions compare to more routine fluctuations in personal social networks. Using data from the Indianapolis Network Mental Health Study, the authors track changes in patients' social networks over three years and compare them to a representative sample of persons with no self-reported mental illness. Overall, individuals at the onset of treatment report larger and more broadly functional social networks than individuals in the population at large. However, the number of network ties among the latter increases over time, whereas network size decreases slightly among people using mental health services. As individuals progress through treatment, less broadly supportive ties drop out of extended networks, but a core safety net remains relatively intact. The findings in this case provide evidence that social network dynamics reflect changing needs and resources: persons labeled with psychiatric disorders learn to manage illness, with functionality driving social interaction in times of biographical disruption.

<title>Interpreting change as controllable: The role of network centrality and self-efficacy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0018726712441642</url>
<snippet>Interpreting organizational change initiatives as controllable can mean the difference between achieving positive or negative outcomes. However, little is known about the factors that underpin such interpretations. This study examines how interpretations of controllability are influenced by individual centrality in social networks and change-related self-efficacy. Drawing on a sample of 148 US public school teachers facing a significant organizational transformation, our analysis reveals that change-related self-efficacy fully mediates relationships between centrality within instrumental and expressive organizational social networks and individual interpretations of change controllability. Network centrality, and the associated access to information and social support that accompany it, are theorized to provide the confidence necessary to interpret change as within one's control. Drawing upon social network theory, we provide insights into how change is interpreted as controllable, and how the nature of change may dictate which types of centrality are most important for such interpretations. Implications for the broader understanding of change are also discussed.

<title>Postmortem Analysis of Decayed Online Social Communities: Cascade Pattern Analysis and Prediction</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/3873601</url>
<snippet>Recently, many online social networks, such as MySpace, Orkut, and Friendster, have faced inactivity decay of their members, which contributed to the collapse of these networks. The reasons, mechanics, and prevention mechanisms of such inactivity decay are not fully understood. In this work, we analyze decayed and alive subwebsites from the Stack Exchange platform. The analysis mainly focuses on the inactivity cascades that occur among the members of these communities. We provide measures to understand the decay process and statistical analysis to extract the patterns that accompany the inactivity decay. Additionally, we predict cascade size and cascade virality using machine learning. The results of this work include a statistically significant difference of the decay patterns between the decayed and the alive subwebsites. These patterns are mainly cascade size, cascade virality, cascade duration, and cascade similarity. Additionally, the contributed prediction framework showed satisfactorily prediction results compared to a baseline predictor. Supported by empirical evidence, the main findings of this work are (1) there are significantly different decay patterns in the alive and the decayed subwebsites of the Stack Exchange; (2) the cascade's node degrees contribute more to the decay process than the cascade's virality, which indicates that the expert members of the Stack Exchange subwebsites were mainly responsible for the activity or inactivity of the Stack Exchange subwebsites; (3) the Statistics subwebsite is going through decay dynamics that may lead to it becoming fully-decayed; (4) the decay process is not governed by only one network measure, it is better described using multiple measures; (5) decayed subwebsites were originally less resilient to inactivity decay, unlike the alive subwebsites; and (6) network's structure in the early stages of its evolution dictates the activity/inactivity characteristics of the network.

<title>Modelling group navigation: transitive social structures improve navigational performance</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2015.0213</url>
<snippet>Collective navigation demands that group members reach consensus on which path to follow, a task that might become more challenging when the group's members have different social connections. Group decision-making mechanisms have been studied successfully in the past using individual-based modelling, although many of these studies have neglected the role of social connections between the group's interacting members. Nevertheless, empirical studies have demonstrated that individual recognition, previous shared experiences and inter-individual familiarity can influence the cohesion and the dynamics of the group as well as the relative spatial positions of specific individuals within it. Here, we use models of collective motion to study the impact of social relationships on group navigation by introducing social network structures into a model of collective motion. Our results show that groups consisting of equally informed individuals achieve the highest level of accuracy when they are hierarchically organized with the minimum number of preferred connections per individual. We also observe that the navigational accuracy of a group will depend strongly on detailed aspects of its social organization. More specifically, group navigation does not only depend on the underlying social relationships, but also on how much weight leading individuals put on following others. Also, we show that groups with certain social structures can compensate better for an increased level of navigational error. The results have broader implications for studies on collective navigation and motion because they show that only by considering a group's social system can we fully elucidate the dynamics and advantages of joint movements.

<title>The Cascade Capacity Predicts Individuals to Seed for Diffusion Through Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sres.2398</url>
<snippet>Why ideas and practices spread an important topic for management scholars and practitioners. This paper presents the cascade capacity as an aspect of network structure as a measure of essentially how 'choosy' everyone in a social network can be and still allow an individual to cause something to spread completely through the network. Drawing on social contagion theory and network theory, we propose a research model about how network structure relates to diffusion and test it by simulation, using network data from the popular microblogging service Twitter. Results show the cascade capacity is an important determinant of diffusion, even when we model for homophily. We show how the concept could be used to select individuals to seed to encourage word of mouth marketing. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

<title>Balancing the strength of external and internal tie for tacit knowledge management</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2020.1714025</url>
<snippet>From external and internal perspective, this research constructs the model regarding tie strength and tacit knowledge management based on social network theory. To test the proposed model, this study disposes and analyses the data captured from 301 emerging firms located in Chinese large cities. The results confirm the proposition that both external and internal tie strength impose a positive effect on the process of tacit knowledge management. In addition, temperate internal tie strength positively affects the relationship between external tie strength and tacit knowledge acquisition, while excessive internal tie strength negatively moderates this relationship. This study not only expands the theoretical space in the field of social networks and knowledge management, but also provides guidance for the enterprise's relationship network management and innovation practice.

<title>Theorizing and mapping media ownership networks in authoritarian-populist contexts: a comparative analysis of Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, and Turkey</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01634437231179366</url>
<snippet>This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discussions on authoritarian populism and the media, from the lens of the political economy of ownership. In contrast to studies that consider the link between media and authoritarian populism by focusing on the discursive structures of populist communication, this study analyses changes in the structure of news media ownership in four European countries that have been subject to authoritarian populism. By employing social network analysis, a methodology rarely used in media ownership research, we reveal how news media ownership concentration as well as changes in ownership structures have provided favorable conditions for the rise and endurance of authoritarian populism. Our study covers ownership developments during the period 2000 to 2020, in Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, and Turkey where authoritarian populist tendencies have been evident, albeit to varying degrees. Conclusions are drawn to illustrate how authoritarian populist actors in the sample countries not only capitalize on prevailing news media ownership structures, but also proactively intervene in ownership relations in order to increase influence over the diffusion of information.

<title>Social network analysis of a landscape-scale conservation initiative in South Africa</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/sajs.2022/11703</url>
<snippet>Assessment of social relations, including social network analysis, is central to understanding collaborative processes for environmental decision-making and action. The capacity of network role players to learn and adapt appropriately to uncertainty and change is a critical determinant of the resilience of social-ecological systems. Poor social network structure can predispose failure. In this study, we used social network analysis to explore learning capacity and network resilience in a multi-authority conservation initiative on the West Coast of South Africa (Dassenberg Coastal Catchment Partnership). Our analysis focused on structural variables for network learning and resilience, namely connectivity, heterogeneity, and centrality. The governance network was found to be structurally connected, with the interaction between heterogeneous organisations and sectors, and centralised around a core group of actors. The network had good structural features to enable learning. However, the high level of centrality, and dependence on a small number of core actors, rendered the network potentially vulnerable to dealing with complex challenges. We recommend that core actors (1) reflect on their core functions and whether the network can absorb these functions if they were to leave and (2) tap into the knowledge potential of actors on the network periphery or invite new actors to the network when dealing with complex challenges. This may require the network to diverge into decentralised subgroups to deal with complex issues. We further suggest that the Dassenberg Coastal Catchment Partnership network incorporate social network research with qualitative monitoring into a long-term plan to monitor the movement and influence of actors as the initiative evolves. Significance: This study illustrates how social network analysis can help researchers, public-sector organisations, and donor agencies to monitor the structural features of governance networks that enable or disable learning and resilience within landscape-scale conservation initiatives. Our results illustrate how social network analysis can assist public-sector actors to reflect on their roles and whether there is redundant competency within the network to maintain its resilience.

<title>Building social networks out of cognitive blocks: factors of interest in agent-based socio-cognitive simulations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-014-9179-0</url>
<snippet>This paper examines how cognitive and environmental factors influence the formation of dyadic ties. We use agent models instantiated in ACT-R that interact in a social simulation, to illustrate the effect of memory constraints on networks. We also show that environmental factors are important including population size, running time, and map configuration. To examine these relationships, we ran simulations of networks using a factorial design. Our analyses suggest three interesting conclusions: first, the tie formation of these networks approximates a logistic growth model; second, that agent memory quality (i.e., perfect or human-like) strongly alters the network's density and structure; third, that the three environmental factors all influence both network density and some aspects of network structure. These findings suggest that meaningful variance of social network analysis measures occur in a narrow band of memory strength (the cognitive band); the threshold for defining tie criteria is important; and future simulations examining generative social networks should control and carefully report these environmental and cognitive factors.

<title>Reputation Detection for Information Diffusion in Social Network Systems</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/5317738</url>
<snippet>Reputation detection in traditional distributed systems (e.g., electronic commerce systems and peer-to-peer systems) relies heavily on the factor of interaction reputation, which can be derived from direct interactions between agents through bidirectional relationships. However, in the current information diffusion in social network systems (SNS) (e.g., Twitter), the characteristic of the unidirectional relationship between agents and the decay property of diffusion will result in lacking direct interactions; therefore, interaction reputations will be difficult to be obtained by agents in a distributed manner. To solve this problem, a novel distributed reputation detection model following the pattern "from path to individual" (FPTI) is proposed, which can provide a new reputation factor as an alternative to interaction reputation in such environments. The main idea is that the positive (or negative) observation of an information diffusion process increases (or decreases) the belief of the corresponding diffusion path, which further increases (or decreases) the reputation of each involved agent. Thus, the reputation of a target agent can be assessed by the superimposition of reputations of multiple paths on which this agent has participated in past information diffusion processes. Furthermore, being aware of agent's limited capacity for reputation detection in SNS, we then propose the enhanced FPTI model (eFPTI), which simplifies the detection source to reduce detection costs and achieve the approximate performance as FPTI. Theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our models and also show several properties of the models, for example, the robustness for dynamic environments.

<title>HOW ARE TWITTER ACTIVITIES RELATED TO TOP CRYPTOCURRENCIES' PERFORMANCE? EVIDENCE FROM SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORK AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.5559/di.28.3.04</url>
<snippet>Cryptocurrencies have embraced Twitter as a major channel of communication. Employing social network analysis and sentiment analysis, this study investigates the Twitter-mediated communication behaviors among cryptocurrencies. This study determines whether a significant association exists between cryptocurrencies' Twitter networks and their credit scores. Data were drawn from the Twitter pages of several top cryptocurrencies. The results indicate that reply-mention networks had the densest structure, that the following-follower network structure was correlated with the reply-mention structure, and that the reply-mention and co-tweet networks were positively correlated. The results also indicate that cryptocurrencies' active networking strategies affected their credit scores and more importantly, that cryptocurrencies frequently linked with fellow currencies tended to have high credit scores.

<title>The Problem of Scaling in Exponential Random Graph Models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0049124120986178</url>
<snippet>This study shows that residual variation can cause problems related to scaling in exponential random graph models (ERGM). Residual variation is likely to exist when there are unmeasured variables in a model-even those uncorrelated with other predictors-or when the logistic form of the model is inappropriate. As a consequence, coefficients cannot be interpreted as effect sizes or compared between models and homophily coefficients, as well as other interaction coefficients, cannot be interpreted as substantive effects in most ERGM applications. We conduct a series of simulations considering the substantive impact of these issues, revealing that realistic levels of residual variation can have large consequences for ERGM inference. A flexible methodological framework is introduced to overcome these problems. Formal tests of mediation and moderation are also proposed. These methods are applied to revisit the relationship between selective mixing and triadic closure in a large AddHealth school friendship network. Extensions to other classes of statistical work models are discussed.

<title>Influence of number of individuals and observations per individual on a model of community structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252471</url>
<snippet>Social network analysis is increasingly applied to understand animal groups. However, it is rarely feasible to observe every interaction among all individuals in natural populations. Studies have assessed how missing information affects estimates of individual network positions, but less attention has been paid to metrics that characterize overall network structure such as modularity, clustering coefficient, and density. In cases such as groups displaying fission-fusion dynamics, where subgroups break apart and rejoin in changing conformations, missing information may affect estimates of global network structure differently than in groups with distinctly separated communities due to the influence single individuals can have on the connectivity of the network. Using a bat maternity group showing fission-fusion dynamics, we quantify the effect of missing data on global network measures including community detection. In our system, estimating the number of communities was less reliable than detecting community structure. Further, reliably assorting individual bats into communities required fewer individuals and fewer observations per individual than to estimate the number of communities. Specifically, our metrics of global network structure (i.e., graph density, clustering coefficient, R-com) approached the 'real' values with increasing numbers of observations per individual and, as the number of individuals included increased, the variance in these estimates decreased. Similar to previous studies, we recommend that more observations per individual should be prioritized over including more individuals when resources are limited. We recommend caution when making conclusions about animal social networks when a substantial number of individuals or observations are missing, and when possible, suggest subsampling large datasets to observe how estimates are influenced by sampling intensity. Our study serves as an example of the reliability, or lack thereof, of global network measures with missing information, but further work is needed to determine how estimates will vary with different data collection methods, network structures, and sampling periods.

<title>The Microrelations of Urban Governance: Dynamics of Patronage and Partnership</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/709250</url>
<snippet>The classic urban ecological paradigm envisioned the articulation of the social organization of neighborhoods with that of the city as a whole. This article offers novel empirical evidence in support of this proposition. We analyze the microrelations of governance across two key urban domains, politics and nonprofit organizations, and identify the district-based politician as a key actor linking neighborhood-based and citywide forms of social organization. Using data of contracts allocated by city council members to nonprofits in New York City, analysis of the social network system linking these two types of actors shows two distinct relational dynamics: apatronage dynamiccharacterized by exclusive and long-lasting relationships between a council member and his/her local constituency and apartnership dynamiccharacterized by citywide relationships that are short-lived and fostered by organizational differentiation and embeddedness. Furthermore, politicians and nonprofits differently accommodate the copresence of these two models of resource allocation.

<title>A time evolving online social network generation algorithm</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-29443-w</url>
<snippet>The rapid growth of online social media usage in our daily lives has increased the importance of analyzing the dynamics of online social networks. However, the dynamic data of existing online social media platforms are not readily accessible. Hence, there is a necessity to synthesize networks emulating those of online social media for further study. In this work, we propose an epidemiology-inspired and community-based, time-evolving online social network generation algorithm (EpiCNet), to generate a time-evolving sequence of random networks that closely mirror the characteristics of real-world online social networks. Variants of the algorithm can produce both undirected and directed networks to accommodate different user interaction paradigms. EpiCNet utilizes compartmental models inspired by mathematical epidemiology to simulate the flow of individuals into and out of the online social network. It also employs an overlapping community structure to enable more realistic connections between individuals in the network. Furthermore, EpiCNet evolves the community structure and connections in the simulated online social network as a function of time and with an emphasis on the behavior of individuals. EpiCNet is capable of simulating a variety of online social networks by adjusting a set of tunable parameters that specify the individual behavior and the evolution of communities over time. The experimental results show that the network properties of the synthetic time-evolving online social network generated by EpiCNet, such as clustering coefficient, node degree, and diameter, match those of typical real-world online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.

<title>What Makes Weak Ties Strong?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-030921-034152</url>
<snippet>We raise two challenges concerning the validity of arguments underlying Granovetter's strength of weak ties (SWT) thesis: (a) whether weak ties are actually bridges, i.e., they help reach more socially distant actors than strong ties, and (b) whether weak ties transmit information effectively enough so that weak ties' alleged structural properties make them more useful than strong ties. In the course of reviewing subsequent research that has made progress in addressing these challenges, we identify both potential limits and possibilities for the SWT thesis. We argue for the importance of identifying how actors' agency-i.e., the way people use their ties-may affect social networks' value. We conclude by summarizing some outstanding questions that progress on the SWT thesis has generated.

<title>Patent citation network analysis: A perspective from descriptive statistics and ERGMs</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241797</url>
<snippet>Patent Citation Analysis has been gaining considerable traction over the past few decades. In this paper, we collect extensive information on patents and citations and provide a perspective of citation network analysis of patents from a statistical viewpoint. We identify and analyze the most cited patents, the most innovative and the highly cited companies along with the structural properties of the network by providing in-depth descriptive analysis. Furthermore, we employ Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to analyze the citation networks. ERGMs enables understanding the social perspectives of a patent citation network which has not been studied earlier. We demonstrate that social properties such as homophily (the inclination to cite patents from the same country or in the same language) and transitivity (the inclination to cite references' references) together with the technicalities of the patents (e.g., language, categories), has a significant effect on citations. We also provide an in-depth analysis of citations for sectors in patents and how it is affected by the size of the same. Overall, our paper delves into European patents with the aim of providing new insights and serves as an account for fitting ERGMs on large networks and analyzing them. ERGMs help us model network mechanisms directly, instead of acting as a proxy for unspecified dependence and relationships among the observations.

<title>Vertical organizations, flat networks: Centrality and criminal collaboration in the Italian-American Mafia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.06.001</url>
<snippet>While criminal organizations often feature hierarchical positions, scholars debate the extent to which networks of informal collaboration among criminals reflect such hierarchies. This research uses historical data on collaboration involving more than 700 criminals across 24 Italian-American Mafia families and applies network regression models and simulations to determine whether mafiosi of similar centrality-based status were more likely to be criminal associates than mafiosi of dissimilar status. Rather than forming vertical collaborations linking mafia members into a centralized, hierarchical network structure, we find that mafiosi collaborated disproportionately more with colleagues of similar status. While network centrality predicted tie formation, formal rank in an organizational chart generally did not. Knowledge simply of a covert organization's formal structure may not translate to understanding "on-the-ground" collaborations.

<title>Cognitive and Social Structure of the Elite Collaboration Network of Astrophysics: A Case Study on Shifting Network Structures</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11024-011-9184-0</url>
<snippet>Scientific collaboration can only be understood along the epistemic and cognitive grounding of scientific disciplines. New scientific discoveries in astrophysics led to a major restructuring of the elite network of astrophysics. To study the interplay of the epistemic grounding and the social network structure of a discipline, a mixed-methods approach is necessary. It combines scientometrics, quantitative network analysis and visualization tools with a qualitative network analysis approach. The centre of the international collaboration network of astrophysics is demarcated by identifying the 225 most productive astrophysicists. For the years 1998-1999 and 2001-2006 four co-authorship networks are constructed comprehending each a two year period. A visualization of the longitudinal network data gives first hints on the structural development of the network. The network of 2005-2006 is analyzed in depth. Based on cohesion analysis tools for network analysis, two main cores and three smaller ones are identified. Scientists in each core and additionally in structurally interesting positions are identified and 17 qualitative expert interviews are conducted with them. The visualization of the network of 2005-2006 is used in the interviews as a stimulus for the interviewees. An analysis of the three most often used keywords of the 225 astrophysicists is included and combined with the other data. The triangulation of these approaches shows that major epistemic changes in astrophysics, e.g. the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe, together with technical and organizational innovations, leads to a restructuring of the network of the discipline. The importance of a combination of qualitative and quantitative network analysis tools for the understanding of the interplay of cognitive and social structure in the sociology of science is substantiated.

<title>Link recommendation algorithms and dynamics of polarization in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2102141118</url>
<snippet>The level of antagonism between political groups has risen in the past years. Supporters of a given party increasingly dislike members of the opposing group and avoid intergroup interactions, leading to homophilic social networks. While new connections offline are driven largely by human decisions, new connections on online social platforms are intermediated by link recommendation algorithms, e.g., "People you may know" or "Whom to follow" suggestions. The long-term impacts of link recommendation in polarization are unclear, particularly as exposure to opposing viewpoints has a dual effect: Connections with out-group members can lead to opinion convergence and prevent group polarization or further separate opinions. Here, we provide a complex adaptive-systems perspective on the effects of link recommendation algorithms. While several models justify polarization through rewiring based on opinion similarity, here we explain it through rewiring grounded in structural similarity-defined as similarity based on network properties. We observe that preferentially establishing links with structurally similar nodes (i.e., sharing many neighbors) results in network topologies that are amenable to opinion polarization. Hence, polarization occurs not because of a desire to shield oneself from disagreeable attitudes but, instead, due to the creation of inadvertent echo chambers. When networks are composed of nodes that react differently to out-group contacts, either converging or polarizing, we find that connecting structurally dissimilar nodes moderates opinions. Overall, our study sheds light on the impacts of social-network algorithms and unveils avenues to steer dynamics of radicalization and polarization in online social networks.

<title>Is fertility contagious? Using panel data to disentangle mechanisms of social network influences on fertility decisions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2013.10.001</url>
<snippet>Using panel data (N = 1.679 married and cohabiting couples), this paper investigates the presence and causal mechanisms of social contagion processes regarding first births. Results confirmed the hypothesized positive association between the number of network members (friends, acquaintances, siblings) with young children and the respondents' transition rate into parenthood, particularly among younger couples. Several potential intervening mechanisms underlying this social contagion effect were tested. First, evidence was found for observational learning processes in which Ego obtained information on the joys and challenges of parenthood from network members with children. Second, childless respondents tended to feel pressured from couples with children in the network to start a family. Third, results supported the notion of social opportunity costs in that the anticipated loss of social ties after becoming a parent was more likely the fewer parents there were in the network. All three mechanisms exerted a positive impact on both fertility intentions and behavior. Panel regression models relying on intraindividtal change scores showed that social learning was the most robust mechanism. An additional indirect test for causality suggested that the findings were unlikely to merely reflect parental status homophily (i.e., selection effects). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

<title>Contributions of brokerage roles to firms' innovation in a confectionery cluster</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2015.1045858</url>
<snippet>Scholars have provided valuable insights into the networking phenomenon and its impact on firms' performance. Nonetheless, a wide spectrum of issues remains unexplored. Using the network approach, this paper examines the different patterns of intermediation between otherwise disconnected firms and its impact on innovation performance. Our research was conducted on a well-known confectionery cluster in the Valencia region. The data allowed us to calculate four brokerage roles, depending on the affiliation of the organisations involved. Through these values, we open the 'black box' of brokerage by examining the differential contributions made to innovation performance by the coordinator, gatekeeper, representative, and liaison roles. These differences between roles are based on the tacit or explicit nature of the knowledge transferred and the specificities of each broker profile. Consequently, the research makes a relevant contribution to the network and cluster literatures and implies some useful recommendations for policy-makers and individual firms.

<title>Navigating networks by using homophily and degree</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0800497105</url>
<snippet>Many large distributed systems can be characterized as networks where short paths exist between nearly every pair of nodes. These include social, biological, communication, and distribution networks, which often display power-law or small-world structure. A central challenge of distributed systems is directing messages to specific nodes through a sequence of decisions made by individual nodes without global knowledge of the network. We present a probabilistic analysis of this navigation problem that produces a surprisingly simple and effective method for directing messages. This method requires calculating only the product of the two measures widely used to summarize all local information. It outperforms prior approaches reported in the literature by a large margin, and it provides a formal model that may describe how humans make decisions in sociological studies intended to explore the social network as well as how they make decisions in more naturalistic settings.

<title>Short-term and long-term effects of a social network intervention on friendships among university students</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59594-z</url>
<snippet>Informal social relations, such as friendships, are crucial for the well-being and success of students at all levels of education. Network interventions can aim at providing contact opportunities in school settings to prevent the social isolation of individuals and facilitate integration between otherwise segregated social groups. We investigate the short-term and long-term effects of one specific network intervention in an undergraduate cohort freshly admitted to an engineering department (N=226). In this intervention, we randomly assigned students into small groups at an introduction event two months prior to their first day at university. The groups were designed to increase mixed-gender contact opportunities. Two months after the intervention, we find a higher rate of friendships, common friends, and mixed-gender friendships in pairs of students who were assigned to the same group than in pairs from different groups (short-term effects). These effects gradually diminish over the first academic year (long-term effects). Using stochastic actor-oriented models, we investigate the long-term trajectory of the intervention effects, while considering alternative network processes, such as reciprocity, transitivity, homophily, and popularity. The results suggest that even though the induced friendship ties are less stable than other friendships, they may serve as early seeds for complex social network processes. Our study shows that simple network interventions can have a pronounced short-term effect and indirect long-term effects on the evolution and structure of student communities.

<title>A network centrality bias: Central individuals in workplace networks have more supportive coworkers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.12.002</url>
<snippet>Combining the results of two empirical studies, we investigate the role of alters' motivation in explaining change in ego's network position over time. People high in communal motives, who are prone to supportive and altruistic behavior in their interactions with others as a way to gain social acceptance, prefer to establish ties with co-workers occupying central positions in organizational social networks. This effect results in a systematic network centrality bias: The personal network of central individuals (individuals with many incoming ties from colleagues) is more likely to contain more supportive and altruistic people than the personal network of in-dividuals who are less central (individuals with fewer incoming ties). This result opens the door to the possibility that the effects of centrality so frequently documented in empirical studies may be due, at least in part, to characteristics of the alters in an ego's personal community, rather than to egos themselves. Our findings invite further empirical research on how alters' motives affect the returns that people can reap from their personal networks in organizations.

<title>Power and Relation in the World Polity: The INGO Network Country Score, 1978-1998</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/sof.0.0217</url>
<snippet>World polity theory is explicitly relational, implying a global network structure that exists outside of the nation-state. And world polity theory increasingly acknowledges power - that some states and regions are dominant in the international field. But current world polity measures of international nongovernmental organizations do not adequately incorporate either networks or power, leading to a mismatch between theory and measurement. In this article, we draw upon world polity, world system and social networks theories to inform the development Of a new over-time measure Of country-level connectedness to the world polity, which we label the "INGO Network Country Score." This measure scores countries by their centrality in the world country-INGO network. We compare our newly-proposed INGO Network Country Score to the traditional measure (country-level raw counts of INGO memberships) and demonstrate striking differences. Our network-based measure shows less inequality among Western countries than the traditional measure, and greater inequality between the West and the rest of the world. Looking over time, we draw three further implications from our new measure. First, there is evidence of inequality in network centrality in the world polity at all time points. Second, regional inequalities persist. Third, connections in the world polity are not exponentially increasing, as previously hypothesized. An added benefit of the analysis is our presentation of the first visual representation of country connections through INGOs.

<title>The Dynamics of Closeness and Betweenness</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2011.597011</url>
<snippet>Although both betweenness and closeness centrality are claimed to be important for the effectiveness of someone's network position, it has not been comprehensively studied which networks emerge if actors strive to optimize their centrality in the network in terms of betweenness and closeness. We study each of these centrality measures separately, but we also analyze what happens if actors value betweenness and closeness simultaneously. Network dynamics differ considerably in a scenario with either betweenness or closeness incentives compared with a scenario in which closeness and betweenness incentives are combined. There are not only more stable networks if actors' betweenness and closeness are combined, but also these stable networks are less stylized.

<title>Social networks and risk of delayed hospital arrival after acute stroke</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09073-5</url>
<snippet>Arriving rapidly to the hospital after a heart attack or stroke is critical for patients to be within time windows for treatment. Prior research in heart attacks has suggested a paradoxical role of the social environment: those who arrive early are surrounded by nonrelatives, while those who arrive late are surrounded by spouses or family members. Here, we used network methods to more deeply examine the influence of social context in stroke. We examined the relationship of personal social networks and arrival time in 175 stroke patients. Our results confirmed the paradox by showing that small and close-knit personal networks of highly familiar contacts, independent of demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic factors, were related to delay. The closed network structure led to constricted information flow in which patients and close confidants, absent outside perspectives, elected to watch-and-wait. Targeting patients with small, close-knit networks may be one strategy to improve response times.

<title>Social Network Influence on Online Behavioral Choices: Exploring Group Formation on Social Network Sites</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764214527092</url>
<snippet>Social media communication is characterized by reduced anonymity and off-to-online social interactions. These characteristics require scholars to revisit social influence mechanisms online. The current study builds on social influence literature to explore social network and gender effects on online behavior. Findings from a quasi-experiment suggest that both network-related variables and gender are significantly associated with online behavior. Perceived social environment, measured by personal network exposure rate, is more significant than objective reality, measured by frequency of received social messages, in determining behavior. We discuss the implications of social contagion effects on web-based strategic communication-including advertising, political campaigns, and social mobilization. Data limitations and the difficulty of measuring social network influence via social media are also discussed.

<title>Responsiveness of Mining Community Acceptance Model to Key Parameter Changes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3458</url>
<snippet>The mining industry has difficulties predicting changes in the level of community acceptance of its projects over time. These changes are due to changes in the society and individual perceptions around these mines as a result of the mines' environmental and social impacts. Agent-based modeling can be used to facilitate better understanding of how community acceptance changes with changing mine environmental impacts. This work investigates the sensitivity of an agent-based model (ABM) for predicting changes in community acceptance of a mining project due to information diffusion to key input parameters. Specifically, this study investigates the responsiveness of the ABM to average degree (total number of friends) of the social network, close neighbour ratio (a measure of homophily in the social network) and number of early adopters ("innovators"). A two-level full factorial experiment was used to investigate the sensitivity of the model to these parameters. The primary (main), secondary and tertiary effects of each parameter were estimated to assess the model's sensitivity. The results show that the model is more responsive to close neighbour ratio and number of early adopters than average degree. Consequently, uncertainty surrounding the inferences drawn from simulation experiments using the agent-based model will be minimized by obtaining more reliable estimates of close neighbour ratio and number of early adopters. While it is possible to reliably estimate the level of early adopters from the literature, the degree of homophily (close neighbour ratio) has to be estimated from surveys that can be expensive and unreliable. Further, work is required to find economic ways to document relevant degrees of homophily in social networks in mining communities.

<title>Robustness and rich clubs in collaborative learning groups: a learning analytics study using network science</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71483-z</url>
<snippet>Productive and effective collaborative learning is rarely a spontaneous phenomenon but rather the result of meeting a set of conditions, orchestrating and scaffolding productive interactions. Several studies have demonstrated that conflicts can have detrimental effects on student collaboration. Through the application of network science, and social network analysis in particular, this learning analytics study investigates the concept of group robustness; that is, the capacity of collaborative groups to remain functional despite the withdrawal or absence of group members, and its relation to group performance in the frame of collaborative learning. Data on all student and teacher interactions were collected from two phases of a course in medical education that employed an online learning environment. Visual and mathematical analysis were conducted, simulating the removal of actors and its effect on the group's robustness and network structure. In addition, the extracted network parameters were used as features in machine learning algorithms to predict student performance. The study contributes findings that demonstrate the use of network science to shed light on essential elements of collaborative learning and demonstrates how the concept and measures of group robustness can increase understanding of the conditions of productive collaborative learning. It also contributes to understanding how certain interaction patterns can help to promote the sustainability or robustness of groups, while other interaction patterns can make the group more vulnerable to withdrawal and dysfunction. The finding also indicate that teachers can be a driving factor behind the formation of rich clubs of well-connected few and less connected many in some cases and can contribute to a more collaborative and sustainable process where every student is included.Y

<title>RETRACTED: Limited individual attention and online virality of low-quality information (Retracted Article)</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-017-0132</url>
<snippet>Social media are massive marketplaces where ideas and news compete for our attention(1). Previous studies have shown that quality is not a necessary condition for online virality(2) and that knowledge about peer choices can distort the relationship between quality and popularity(3). However, these results do not explain the viral spread of low-quality information, such as the digital misinformation that threatens our democracy(4). We investigate quality discrimination in a stylized model of an online social network, where individual agents prefer quality information, but have behavioural limitations in managing a heavy flow of information. We measure the relationship between the quality of an idea and its likelihood of becoming prevalent at the system level. We find that both information overload and limited attention contribute to a degradation of the market's discriminative power. A good tradeoff between discriminative power and diversity of information is possible according to the model. However, calibration with empirical data characterizing information load and finite attention in real social media reveals a weak correlation between quality and popularity of information. In these realistic conditions, the model predicts that low-quality information is just as likely to go viral, providing an interpretation for the high volume of misinformation we observe online.

<title>SOCIAL NETWORKS AND ORGANIZATIONAL DYNAMICS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2096202</url>
<snippet>In this paper we develop and test a theory of the dynamic behavior of voluntary groups. The theory combines an image of social network structure with the concept of natural selection to model changes in group composition over time. We consider the group to be a population of members subject to natural selection in sociodemographic space. According to the theory, the probability that members will enter or leave the group depends upon the number and strength of social network ties that connect group members to each other and to nonmembers. We analyze an event history dataset constructed from interviews using Life History Calendar method and information on ego-centered social networks developed from the General Social Survey Network Module. We test the hypothesis that network connections inside a group are associated with reduced membership turnover, while connections outside the group increase turnover. We find that weak ties and network connections that span greater distances in sociodemographic space are positively correlated with leaving current groups and joining new ones. We conclude that weak ties are a major source of change in group composition.

<title>How gender differences in informal networking result in unequal access to interorganizational R&amp;D projects</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13511610.2024.2380368</url>
<snippet>Women are underrepresented in interorganizational research &amp; development (R&amp;D) projects. This affects the innovativeness of such projects, the representation of female perspectives in the design of innovations and the career opportunities of women. Such projects often emerge from preceding interorganizational R&amp;D projects and are particularly successful when they do so. We argue that instrumental networking in ongoing projects is constitutive for the formation of such follow-up collaborations and, further, that stereotypical gender roles hinder women's participation in instrumental interactions with their current project partners. Hence, we assume that unequal opportunities to participate in follow-up projects can be attributed to women's lesser involvement in instrumental networks. Empirically, we test our argument using data on 2746 directed and weighted personal relationships across 24 interorganizational R&amp;D projects. We show that instrumental interactions are crucial for who initiates follow-up projects with which current partner. Furthermore, we can show that the low participation of women in these activities can be better explained by gender roles than by gender homophily. In doing so, we reveal an important cause of women's under-representation in R&amp;D.

<title>A Member Saved Is a Member Earned? The Recruitment-Retention Trade-Off and Organizational Strategies for Membership Growth</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122417693616</url>
<snippet>A long line of research documents the essential role of social networks in mediating the recruitment and retention of members in organizations. But organizations also comprise a primary context where people form social ties. We investigate how the network structure an organization creates among its members influences its ability to grow and reproduce. In particular, we propose that two dimensions of organizational strategy influence affiliation dynamics: (1) the extent to which an organization induces social interaction among its members (social encapsulation), and (2) the time and energy that an organization demands of its members (time and energy demand). We examine membership dynamics in an ecology where competitor organizations deploying varied strategies vie for the same pool of members. Results show a curvilinear relationship between membership growth and the rate of social encapsulation. Furthermore, we find that time and energy demand mediates the effect of social encapsulation by shaping its members' opportunities for maintaining external affiliations. Different opportunity structures result in different levels of network turnover, thus either reinforcing or dissolving intra-organizational ties. For most types of organizations, attaining sustained growth requires a balance between open networks (for recruitment) and network closure (for retention).

<title>Reinforced structural holes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2015.04.008</url>
<snippet>Holes in social structure are variably reinforced by the social organization around the hole. The more reinforced the hole, the greater the difficulty in bridging it, but the more likely a successful bridge will carry information novel, and so potentially valuable, to people on the other side. To study how reinforcement varies with access to structural holes, and the achievement associated with access, I propose a measure of access to reinforced structural holes (RSH), and present results predicting achievement in an integrated banker organization and a balkanized supply-chain organization. In both study populations, the people who have access to structural holes also have access to reinforced structural holes, and all measures of access have a statistically significant association with achievement. However, there is no consistent prediction advantage from incorporating reinforcement in measures of access to structural holes. The reinforced-holes measure predicts compensation better or as well as network constraint and betweenness, but is weaker or no better than a count of nonredundant contacts. I do not infer from the results a rank-order of alternative measures so much as substitutability. I expect achievement to be associated with access to structural holes, but I expect the association to vary across alternative measures depending on how achievement is achieved in a specific population.

<title>An entropy-based method to control COVID-19 rumors in online social networks using opinion leaders</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.102048</url>
<snippet>-In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, people spread various COVID-19-related rumors and hoaxes that negatively influence human civilization through online social networks (OSN). The proposed research addresses the unique and innovative approach to controlling COVID-19 rumors through the power of opinion leaders (OLs) in OSN. The entire process is partitioned into two phases; the first phase describes the novel Reputation-based Opinion Leader Identification (ROLI) algorithm, including a unique voting method to identify the top-T OLs in the OSN. The second phase describes the technique to measure the aggregated polarity score of each posted tweet/post and compute each user's reputation. The empirical reputation is utilized to calculate the user's trust, the post's entropy, and its veracity. If the experimental entropy of the post is lower than the empirical threshold value, the post is likely to be categorized as a rumor. The proposed approach operated on Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit social networks for validation. The ROLI algorithm provides 91&#37; accuracy, 93&#37; precision, 95&#37; recall, and 94&#37; F1-score over other Social Network Analysis (SNA) measures to find OLs in OSN. Moreover, the proposed approach's rumor controlling effectiveness and efficiency is also estimated based on three standard metrics; affected degree, represser degree, and diffuser degree, and obtained 26&#37;, 22&#37;, and 23&#37; improvement, respectively. The concluding outcomes illustrate that the influence of OLs is exceptionally significant in controlling COVID-19 rumors.

<title>Mean-field theory of social laser</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12327-w</url>
<snippet>In this work we suggest a novel paradigm of social laser (solaser), which can explain such Internet inspired social phenomena as echo chambers, reinforcement and growth of information cascades, enhancement of social actions under strong mass media operation. The solaser is based on a wellknown in quantum physics laser model of coherent amplification of the optical field. Social networks are at the core of the solaser model; we define them by means of a network model possessing power-law degree distribution. In the solaser the network environment plays the same role as the gain medium has in a physical laser device. We consider social atoms as decision making agents (humans or even chat bots), which possess two (mental) states and occupy the nodes of a network. The solaser establishes communication between the agents as absorption and spontaneous or stimulated emission of socially actual information within echo chambers, which mimic an optical resonator of a convenient (physical) laser. We have demonstrated that social lasing represents the second order nonequilibrium phase transition, which evokes the release of coherent socially stimulated information field represented with the order parameter. The solaser implies the formation of macroscopic social polarization and results in a huge social impact, which is realized by viral information cascades occurring in the presence of population imbalance (social bias). We have shown that decision making agents follow an adiabatically time dependent mass media pump, which acts in the network community reproducing various reliable scenarios for information cascade evolution. We have also shown that in contrast to physical lasers, due to node degree peculiarities, the coupling strength of decision making agents with the network may be enhanced root &lt; k &gt; times. It leads to a large increase of speed, at which a viral message spreads through a social media. In this case, the mass media pump supports additional reinforcement and acceleration of cascade growth. We have revealed that the solaser model in some approximations possesses clear links with familiar !sing and SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) models typically used for evaluating a social impact and information growth, respectively. However, the solaser paradigm can serve as a new platform for modelling temporal social events, which originate from "microscopic" (quantum-like) processes occurring in the society. Our findings open new perspectives for interdisciplinary studies of distributed intelligence agents behavior associated with information exchange and social impact.

<title>Individuals' power and their social network accuracy: A situated cognition perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.01.006</url>
<snippet>Individuals differ in how accurately they perceive their social environment, but research and theory provide conflicting predictions on whether powerful people are more or less accurate than others. Drawing on social network theory and the situated cognition theory of power, we examine the relationship between individuals' formal and informal power and their perceptual accuracy of social network relationships. We propose that individuals' perceptual accuracy is related to: 1) their formal and informal power in the organization; 2) the type of relationship being perceived (positive/negative valence) and its relevance to task and goal completion; and 3) the dependence relationship with the target of perception (i.e., whether the perceiver is dependent on the perceived to get their work done). Predictions were tested using cognitive social structure data collected from a technical call center. Results showed that power was generally linked to increased perceptual accuracy, particularly for the types of relationships most relevant for task and goal completion. We further demonstrated that social network accuracy was related to employees' outcomes, including subsequent transfer, promotion, and exit from the organization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

<title>Innovating Teaching Practice Through Professional Learning Communities: Determining Knowledge Sharing and Program Value</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440231200983</url>
<snippet>The Professional Learning Community (PLC) model has been used to help faculty develop innovative teaching practices and diffuse effective strategies and resources throughout K-12 schools. Yet, whether and how PLCs influence research-focused higher education institutions remain unknown. Drawing on existing research on PLCs and the social network theory, this mixed-methods study investigated how participants shared what they learned during their time in the program to build greater capacity and the perceived benefits and weaknesses of the PLC model. We conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 8) and a survey (n = 77) among current PLC fellows and alumni at a large research university. The results based on social network analysis showed that PLC fellows shared knowledge and resources across departments and offices at the university, and these efforts led to additional collaborative research and grant applications. Results also indicate that PLC fellows valued the diversity of the program, developed skills that they used in their courses, gained confidence in their ability to share knowledge and resources, and appreciated the accountability the program provided. Furthermore, respondents rated the program positively and indicated that they were currently using the knowledge and skills gained to further develop innovative teaching practices as well as planning to continue to do so in the future. These findings suggest that the PLC model can be an effective way for universities to empower faculty to develop innovative teaching practices, and, by sharing what they have learned with others, to build capacity for innovative teaching and research practices across the institution.

<title>The Sensitivity of Community Extra-Structural Features on Event Prediction in Dynamic Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393211055813</url>
<snippet>A dynamic Online Social Network is a special type of evolving complex network in which changes occur over time. The structure of a community may change over time due to the relationship changes between its members or with other communities. This is known as a community event. In this paper, we discussed the effect of important individual community features and the lengths of adequate time intervals considered in the analysis of the behavior of social networks on the prediction accuracy of each event. Furthermore, we introduced the extra-structural features as global social network features to justify the relationship between the lengths of time intervals used in the model training by using the best prediction accuracy of events. We found a relationship between the scale of network dynamics and the length of time intervals for observing the spread and decomposed events. Finally, by comparing the accuracy of the model based on time interval length which investigated based on cps-value in this study and using the Event Prediction in Dynamic Social Network (EPDSN) model, the hypothesis of a reverse relationship between cps growth rate and time interval length to obtain better prediction accuracy for both the spread and decomposed events.

<title>A statistical approach for assessing cyber risk via ordered response models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/risa.14186</url>
<snippet>Proper evaluation of the risk associated to a cyber attack is a crucial aspect for many companies. There is an increasing need to plan for and implement effective ways to address cyber security, data security, and privacy protection. Estimating the risk of a successful cyber attack is an important issue, since this type of threat is proliferating and thus poses increasing danger to companies and the customers who use their services. While quantitative loss data are rarely available, it is possible to obtain a qualitative evaluation on an ordinal scale of severity of cyber attacks from experts of the sector. Hence, it is natural to apply order response models for the analysis of cyber risk. In particular, we rely on cumulative link models. We explain the experts' assessment of the severity of a cyber attack as a function of a set of explanatory variables describing the characteristics of the attack under consideration. A measure of diffusion of the effects of the attacks obtained via the use of a network structure is also incorporated into the set of explanatory variables of the model. Along with the description of the methodology, we present a detailed analysis of a real data set that includes information on serious cyber attacks occurred worldwide in the period 2017-2018.

<title>Similarity increases altruistic punishment in humans</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1215443110</url>
<snippet>Humans are attracted to similar others. As a consequence, social networks are homogeneous in sociodemographic, intrapersonal, and other characteristics-a principle called homophily. Despite abundant evidence showing the importance of interpersonal similarity and homophily for human relationships, their behavioral correlates and cognitive foundations are poorly understood. Here, we show that perceived similarity substantially increases altruistic punishment, a key mechanism underlying human cooperation. We induced (dis)similarity perception by manipulating basic cognitive mechanisms in an economic cooperation game that included a punishment phase. We found that similarity-focused participants were more willing to punish others' uncooperative behavior. This influence of similarity is not explained by group identity, which has the opposite effect on altruistic punishment. Our findings demonstrate that pure similarity promotes reciprocity in ways known to encourage cooperation. At the same time, the increased willingness to punish norm violations among similarity-focused participants provides a rationale for why similar people are more likely to build stable social relationships. Finally, our findings show that altruistic punishment is differentially involved in encouraging cooperation under pure similarity vs. in-group conditions.

<title>An interaction mechanism for the maintenance of fission-fusion dynamics under different individual densities</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8974</url>
<snippet>Animals often show high consistency in their social organisation despite facing changing environmental conditions. Especially in shoaling fish, fission-fusion dynamics that describe for which periods individuals are solitary or social have been found to remain unaltered even when density changed. This compensatory ability is assumed to be an adaptation towards constant predation pressure, but the mechanism through which individuals can actively compensate for density changes is yet unknown. The aim of the current study is to identify behavioural patterns that enable this active compensation. We compared the fission-fusion dynamics of two populations of the live-bearing Atlantic molly (Poecilia mexicana) that live in adjacent habitats with very different predator regimes: cave mollies that inhabit a low-predation environment inside a sulfidic cave with a low density of predatory water bugs (Belostoma sp.), and mollies that live directly outside the cave (henceforth called "surface" mollies) in a high-predation environment. We analysed their fission-fusion dynamics under two different fish densities of 12 and 6 fish per 0.36 m(2). As expected, surface mollies spent more time being social than cave mollies, and this difference in social time was a result of surface mollies being less likely to discontinue social contact (once they had a social partner) and being more likely to resume social contact (once alone) than cave mollies. Interestingly, surface mollies were also less likely to switch among social partners than cave mollies. A random walk simulation predicted each population to show reduced social encounters in the low density treatment. While cave mollies largely followed this prediction, surface mollies maintained their interaction probabilities even at low density. Surface mollies achieved this by a reduction in the size of a convex polygon formed by the group as density decreased. This may allow them to largely maintain their fission-fusion dynamics while still being able to visit large parts of the available area as a group. A slight reduction (21&#37;) in the area visited at low densities was also observed but insufficient to explain how the fish maintained their fission-fusion dynamics. Finally, we discuss potential movement rules that could account for the reduction of polygon size and test their performance.

<title>A New Network Feature Affects the Intervention Performance on Public Opinion Dynamic Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41555-w</url>
<snippet>The neighborhood network structure plays an important role in the collective opinion of an opinion dynamic system. Does it also affect the intervention performance? To answer this question, we apply three intervention methods on an opinion dynamic model, the weighted DeGroot model, to change the convergent opinion value (x) over bar. And we define a new network feature Omega, called 'network differential degree', to measure how node degrees couple with influential values in the network, i.e., large Omega indicates nodes with high degree is more likely to couple with large influential value. We investigate the relationship between the intervention performance and the network differential degree Omega in the following three intervention cases: (1) add one special agent (shill) to connect to one normal agent; (2) add one edge between two normal agents; (3) add a number of edges among agents. Through simulations we find significant correlation between the intervention performance, i.e.,vertical bar(x) over bar*vertical bar (the maximum value of the change of convergent opinion value vertical bar(x) over bar vertical bar and Omega in all three cases: the intervention performance vertical bar( x) over bar*vertical bar is higher when Omega is smaller. So Omega could be used to predict how difficult it is to intervene and change the convergent opinion value of the weighted DeGroot model. Meanwhile, a theorem of adding one edge and an algorithm for adding optimal edges are given.

<title>Organizational learning: effects of (network) structure and (individual) strategy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-008-9028-0</url>
<snippet>Earlier theoretical accounts of collective learning relied on rules and operating procedures as the organizational memory (March in Organ. Sci. 2(1): 71-87, 1991; Rodan in Scand. J. Manag. 21: 407-428, 2005). This paper builds on this tradition drawing on ideas from social network theory. Learning is modeled as a social-psychological process (Darr and Kurtzberg in Organ. Behav. Hum. Decis. Process. 82(1): 28-44, 2000; Rulke et al. in Organ. Behav. Hum. Decis. Process. 82(1): 134 149, 2000), in which organizations learn by exchanging information internally between their members (Argote et al. in Organ. Behav. Hum. Decis. Process. 82(1): 1 8, 2000; Carley in Am. Soc. Rev. 56(3): 331-354, 1991; Carley in Soc. Perspect. 48(4): 547-571, 1995). Learning is also characterized as stochastic and creative (Gruenfeld et al. in Organ. Behav. Hum. Decis. Process. 82(1): 45-59, 2000). This model is used to explore predictions about the effect social networks have on idea generation and learning and alternative strategies for choosing from whom to seek information.

<title>Influencing dynamics on social networks without knowledge of network microstructure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2021.0435</url>
<snippet>Social network-based information campaigns can be used for promoting beneficial health behaviours and mitigating polarization (e.g. regarding climate change or vaccines). Network-based intervention strategies typically rely on full knowledge of network structure. It is largely not possible or desirable to obtain population-level social network data due to availability and privacy issues. It is easier to obtain information about individuals' attributes (e.g. age, income), which are jointly informative of an individual's opinions and their social network position. We investigate strategies for influencing the system state in a statistical mechanics based model of opinion formation. Using synthetic and data-based examples we illustrate the advantages of implementing coarse-grained influence strategies on Ising models with modular structure in the presence of external fields. Our work provides a scalable methodology for influencing Ising systems on large graphs and the first exploration of the Ising influence problem in the presence of ambient (social) fields. By exploiting the observation that strong ambient fields can simplify control of networked dynamics, our findings open the possibility of efficiently computing and implementing public information campaigns using insights from social network theory without costly or invasive levels of data collection.

<title>Identifying the new Influencers in the Internet Era: Social Media and Social Network Analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.5477/cis/reis.153.23</url>
<snippet>Social media influencers (SMIs) can be defined as a new type of independent actor who are able to shape audience attitudes through the use of social media channels in competition and coexistence with professional media. Being able to accurately identify SMIs is critical no matter what is being transmitted in a social system. Social Network Analysis (SNA) has been recognized as a powerful tool for representing social network structures and information dissemination. SMIs can be identified by their high-ranking position in a network as the most important or central nodes. The results reveal the existence of three different typologies of SMIs: disseminator, engager and leader. This methodology permits the optimization of resources to create effective online communication strategies.

<title>Convex preferences and power inequality in exchange networks - An experimental study</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/104346399011004003</url>
<snippet>Early theorizing of power in exchange networks, by Homans and Emerson, was based explicitly on the principle that the more of a resource an actor acquires, the less the actor will value additional units of the resource. However, no previous empirical studies of effects of exchange network structure on power have embodied this principle. Generalizing the principle to convexity of actors' preferences, this study is the first to do so. This study experimentally tests the prediction that under specified conditions power inequalities will result in a Line3 (A linked to B linked to C) exchange network where actors' preferences are convex although the network is not characterized by the structural property of exclusion. That is, in the experimental network, linked actors divide pools of resources under exchange rules that mean that all actors can exchange with benefit with all other actors to whom they are linked. Payoffs to resources are specified by a function that operationalizes convexity of preferences. Results support the prediction: the central actor is advantaged in this situation. These results imply that convexity of preferences should be incorporated into theory and research concerning power in exchange networks.

<title>Social Networks and Cognition</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-121919-054736</url>
<snippet>Social network analysis, now often thought of simply as network science, has penetrated nearly every scientific and many scholarly fields and has become an indispensable resource. Yet, social networks are special by virtue of being specifically social, and our growing understanding of the brain is affecting our understanding of how social networks form, mature, and are exploited by their members. We discuss the expanding research on how the brain manages social information, how this information is heuristically processed, and how network cognitions are affected by situation and circumstance. In the process, we argue that the cognitive turn in social networks exemplifies the modern conception of the brain as fundamentally reprogrammable by experience and circumstance. Far from social networks being dependent upon the brain, we anticipate a modern view in which cognition and social networks coconstitute each other.

<title>A Man's world? Comparing the structural positions of men and women in an organized criminal network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10611-020-09910-5</url>
<snippet>The crime gender gap is the difference between the levels of participation of men and women in crime, with men responsible for more crime than women. Recent evidence suggests that the crime gender gap is closing, both in crime in general and in organized crime. However, organized crime differs from other forms of criminal activity in that it entails an organizational structure of cooperation among offenders. Assessing whether the gender gap in organized crime is narrowing is not only about the overall levels of involvement of women, but about their roles and positions within the organized criminal structure, because the involvement of women does not mean that they are in influential positions, or that they have power or access to resources important for the commission of organized crime. This paper uses a social network approach to systematically compare the structural positions of men and women in an organized criminal network. We use a dataset collected by Canadian Law Enforcement consisting of 1390 individuals known or suspected to be involved in organized crime, 185 of whom are women. Our analysis provides evidence for an ongoing gender gap in organized crime, with women occupying structural positions that are generally associated with a lack of power. Overall, women are less present in the network, tend to collaborate with other women rather than with men, and are more often in the disadvantageous position of being connected by male intermediaries. Implications for theory and law enforcement practice are discussed.

<title>Group differences in reciprocity, multiplexity and exchange: measures and application</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-011-9465-6</url>
<snippet>Local forces structure social networks. One major and widely researched local force is reciprocity, often assumed to work homogeneously across actors-i.e., all actors are equally subject to the same level of force towards reciprocity. Other local forces, like multiplexity and exchange, are also often assumed to apply equally to different actors. But social theory provides us with ample arguments why such forces might be stronger in some subsets of actors than others, or why such forces might affect intergroup ties more than intragroup ties. In this paper we introduce standard measures to capture these group specific forces towards reciprocity, multiplexity, and exchange. All the measures control for differential tendencies of actors to initiate ties of various types. We also introduce a procedure by which differences in the strength of these forces between groups and subgroups can be statistically evaluated.

<title>Individual position diversity in dependence socioeconomic networks increases economic output</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0105-9</url>
<snippet>The availability of big data recorded from massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the potential connection between individuals' network positions and their economic outputs. We use a statistical filtering method to construct dependence networks from weighted friendship networks of individuals. We investigate the 30 distinct motif positions in the 13 directed triadic motifs which represent microscopic dependences among individuals. Based on the structural similarity of motif positions, we further classify individuals into different groups. The node position diversity of individuals is found to be positively correlated with their economic outputs. We also find that the economic outputs of leaf nodes are significantly lower than that of the other nodes in the same motif. Our findings shed light on understanding the influence of network structure on economic activities and outputs in socioeconomic systems.

<title>Do women in science form more diverse research networks than men? An analysis of Spanish biomedical scientists</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238229</url>
<snippet>This paper examines the role of gender in the formation of research collaboration networks, by investigating the composition of networks through connections to diverse professional communities. Drawing on an ego network approach, we examine gender differences among researchers' networks in terms of partner diversity, openness and brokerage roles. We use data from 897 valid responses to a questionnaire administered to biomedical scientists in Spain, which enquired into multiple aspects of personal research networks. Our findings show that women form more diverse networks and brokerage triads than men. This result is reinforced if we consider the most heterogeneous brokerage triads in terms of professional differences among network partners (i.e., consultant and liaison). Our results suggest that women are more likely to access non-redundant knowledge and richer research perspectives via their knowledge-flow intermediary roles. This research suggests the need for analyses of gender and networks that go beyond a gender-to-gender approach.

<title>Email effects on the structure of local associations: A social network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2007.00455.x</url>
<snippet>Objectives. This article explores the impact of email on the network structure of small, voluntary associations. By focusing on the density and centralization of associations, we illuminate how the Internet affects their cohesiveness and democratic character. Methods. Based on network data collected from 41 community-based associations that are comparable on a variety of factors known to influence network structure, we employ multiple regression techniques to explore the impact of increased email use on group- and individual-level network measures. Results. We find that the technological nature of email as well as the background, interests, and intentions of its users interact to influence density and centralization. Individuals employ electronic mail differently from other communication modes such as phone and face-to-face communication. Network density increases, and network centralization either increases or decreases, depending on the distribution of email use in the association. Conclusions. These effects on associational structure are likely to have significant long-run impacts on the cohesion, efficacy, and democratic character of voluntary associations.

<title>Information communities: The network structure of communication</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.02.001</url>
<snippet>This study puts forward a variable clique overlap model for identifying information communities, or potentially overlapping subgroups of network actors among whom reinforced independent links ensure efficient communication. We posit that the average intensity of communication between related individuals in information communities is greater than in other areas of the network. Empirical tests show that the variable clique overlap model is indeed more effective in identifying groups of individuals that have strong internal relationships in communication networks relative to prior cohesive subgroup models; the pathways generated by such an arrangement of connections are particularly robust against disruptions of information transmission. Our findings extend the scope of network closure effects proposed by other researchers working with communication networks using social network methods and approaches, a tradition which emphasizes ties between organizations, groups, individuals, and the external environment.

<title>Cumulative effects of triadic closure and homophily in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aax7310</url>
<snippet>Social network structure has often been attributed to two network evolution mechanisms-triadic closure and choice homophily-which are commonly considered independently or with static models. However, empirical studies suggest that their dynamic interplay generates the observed homophily of real-world social networks. By combining these mechanisms in a dynamic model, we confirm the longheld hypothesis that choice homophily and triadic closure cause induced homophily. We estimate how much observed homophily in friendship and communication networks is amplified due to triadic closure. We find that cumulative effects of homophily amplification can also lead to the widely documented core-periphery structure of networks, and to memory of homophilic constraints (equivalent to hysteresis in physics). The model shows that even small individual bias may prompt network-level changes such as segregation or core group dominance. Our results highlight that individuallevel mechanisms should not be analyzed separately without considering the dynamics of society as a whole.

The 1985 General Social Survey network instrument is used to evaluate the effect of integration on anomia and the probability of unhappiness. Results indicate that contact with religiously homogeneous others paired with personal religious belief reduces anomia and the likelihood of unhappiness. Additionally, while ego/alter closeness is important, alter/alter closeness is not. These results suggest that individuals benefit from religious association more so than religious community. Additional analyses indicate that these results are unlikely to be due to homophily. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>How and why: complementary analyses of social network structures and cultural values: improving flood response networks in Queensland, Australia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-013-9982-6</url>
<snippet>Social network analysis (SNA) is well recognized as a tool for informing climate change adaptation; however, this methodology is limited by a focus on quantitative structural analyses (how many nodes and ties exist, and between whom), rather than accessing richer information about their meaning (value content of ties). One way to improve the usefulness of SNA is to purposefully complement the structural analysis with cultural elements that can be drawn from field datasets. In this network-governance case study from Queensland, Australia, research on organizations involved in water management and flood responses events showed that cultural values were important in influencing network connections and preferred approaches to flood pre-planning and response. For example, there were differences in organizational preferences for the numbers and types of links that are rooted in different values. From this, Mary Douglas' Cultural Theory categories of individualists, hierarchists, and egalitarians were extended to analyze the types of ties between network nodes, the preferred approaches of different types of organization, and the problematic links and missing links among network nodes. This work illustrates that analyses of both structural SNA and cultural values can be used to improve regional-level adaptation activities such as disaster management. Here, increased knowledge about social networks, network ties, and cultural values can facilitate a process of social learning that will help societies adapt to climate change impacts.

<title>A Bayesian Semi-Parametric Approach for Modeling Memory Decay in Dynamic Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00491241221113875</url>
<snippet>In relational event networks, the tendency for actors to interact with each other depends greatly on the past interactions between the actors in a social network. Both the volume of past interactions and the time that has elapsed since the past interactions affect the actors' decision-making to interact with other actors in the network. Recently occurred events may have a stronger influence on current interaction behavior than past events that occurred a long time ago-a phenomenon known as "memory decay". Previous studies either predefined a short-run and long-run memory or fixed a parametric exponential memory decay using a predefined half-life period. In real-life relational event networks, however, it is generally unknown how the influence of past events fades as time goes by. For this reason, it is not recommendable to fix memory decay in an ad-hoc manner, but instead we should learn the shape of memory decay from the observed data. In this paper, a novel semi-parametric approach based on Bayesian Model Averaging is proposed for learning the shape of the memory decay without requiring any parametric assumptions. The method is applied to relational event history data among socio-political actors in India and a comparison with other relational event models based on predefined memory decays is provided.

<title>Citizen-Driven International Networks and Globalization of Social Movements on Twitter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439315617263</url>
<snippet>Social media offer an avenue for the formation of citizen-driven global networks that are vital to mobilizing international support and curating global public discourse in social movements. This study looks into the global flow of information and communication about Hong Kong's Occupy Central Movement with a focus on the country/territory-level international network that emerged on Twitter. Drawing on the world systems theory and the literature on social movement, it examines whether the globalization of a local social movement via social media is circumscribed by the existing order of the world system (i.e., from the developed core countries/territories to the developing peripheral). It focuses its analysis on the network structure and the predictors of countries/territories' centrality in the network. Findings of the social network analysis show that the structure of the international network still follows the existing order of the world system to a large extent. It is further supported by the result of the multivariate analysis that national income, a widely used benchmark for determining a country/territory's position in the world economy, is significantly and substantially related to centrality. However, national income does not have the largest predicting power. Instead, a country/territory's level of political grievances is found to be the strongest predictor. In addition, countries/territories with high Internet penetration rates tend to have high-centrality scores, and yet the effect size is smaller than the other predictors.

<title>Identities in flux: Cognitive network activation in times of change</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.01.001</url>
<snippet>Using a dynamic cognitive model, we experimentally test two competing hypotheses that link identity and cognitive network activation during times of change. On one hand, affirming people's sense of power might give them confidence to think beyond the densest subsections of their social networks. Alternatively, if such power affirmations conflict with people's more stable status characteristics, this could create tension, deterring people from considering their networks' diversity. We test these competing hypotheses experimentally by priming people at varying levels of status with power (high/low) and asking them to report their social networks. We show that confirming identity-not affirming power-cognitively prepares people to broaden their social networks when the world is changing around them. The emotional signature of having a confirmed identity is feeling comfortable and in control, which mediates network activation. We suggest that stable, confirmed identities are the foundation from which people can exhibit greater network responsiveness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<title>Physical activity promotion in an urban district: Analyzing the mechanisms of interorganizational cooperation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260053</url>
<snippet>Past research has identified the importance of cooperation among community-based organizations from different sectors to address public health problems such as insufficient physical activity. However, little is known about how and why interorganizational cooperation occurs. The present study sought to analyze the structure and emergent patterns of interorganizational cooperation within a network promoting physical activity based in an urban district neighborhood of a city in Southwestern Germany. Survey data on cooperative relations among 61 network organizations and organizational attributes (e.g., possession of sport facilities) were collected. Social network analysis was applied to examine network properties and exponential random graph models were estimated to test hypotheses concerning mechanisms and conditions of cooperative tie formation. The results show that the network of cooperation is sparse but characterized by a tendency for cooperation to occur in triangular structures. Other significant mechanisms of cooperative tie formation are preferential attachment, with the community department for education and sports being the most central network actor, and heterophily regarding the cooperation of organizations from different sectors. This study provides valid and reliable findings on conditions of network formation and significant mechanisms of interorganizational cooperation in the field of physical activity promotion. Knowledge about these mechanisms can help to manage networks effectively and efficiently and reveal potentials for improvement and intensification of interorganizational cooperation in both the present and other research areas of health promotion.

<title>The role of metanetworks in network evolution</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222500601187884</url>
<snippet>The question of what structures of relations between actors emerge in the evolution of social networks is of fundamental sociological interest. The present research proposes that processes of network evolution can be usefully conceptualized in terms of a network of networks, or "metanetwork," wherein networks that are one link manipulation away from one another are connected. Moreover, the geography of metanetworks has real effects on the course of network evolution. Specifically, both equilibrium and non-equilibrium networks located in more desirable regions of the metanetwork are found to be more probable. These effects of metanetwork geography are illustrated by two dynamic network models: one in which actors pursue access to unique information through "structural holes," and the other in which actors pursue access to valid information by minimizing path length. Finally, I discuss future directions for modeling network dynamics in terms of metanetworks.

<title>R&amp;D internationalisation patterns in the global pharmaceutical industry: evidence from a network analytic perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2015.1012058</url>
<snippet>This study adopts a Social Network Analysis (SNA) perspective to investigate global R&amp;D internationalisation patterns of the pharmaceutical industry. We use co-inventorships identified in pharmaceutical patents granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 1996 and 2013, giving rise to an international collaboration network by drawing a cross-country link when a patent lists at least two inventors located in different countries. We describe changing R&amp;D internationalisation patterns by exploring network structures as a whole as well as the changing role of different countries. The results show that R&amp;D internationalisation indeed has gained momentum in pharmaceutical innovation, in particular after the year 2006. The network has developed from a mono-centric, star-like network - with the USA constituting the only hub - to a more distributed and dense network. The relative decline of the USA has not taken place at the expense of emerging economies but at the expense of European countries.

<title>Social network analysis - centrality parameters and individual network positions of agonistic behavior in pigs over three different age levels</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40064-015-0963-1</url>
<snippet>Knowledge of the network structure of agonistic interactions helps to understand the formation and the development of aggressive behavior. Therefore, video observation data of 149 pigs over three different age levels were investigated for 2 days each directly after mixing (65 groups in the rearing area, 24 groups in the growing stable and 12 groups in the breeding stable). The aim of the study was to use network analysis to investigate the development of individual network positions of specific animals and to determine whether centrality parameters in previous mixing situations have an impact on the future behavior of the animals. The results of the weighted degree centrality indicated that weaned pigs had a higher fighting intensity directly after mixing compared to growing pigs and gilts. Also, the number of different opponents (degree centrality) was higher compared to the older age groups. The betweenness centrality showed relatively small values and no significant differences between the different age levels, whereas the closeness centrality showed high values at all observed age levels. Experiences gained in previous agonistic interactions had an impact on the centrality parameters in subsequent mixing situations. It was shown that the position of individual animals in agonistic interaction networks can be characterized using social network analysis and that changes over different age levels can be detected. Therefore, social network analysis provides insights into the formation and evolution of behavioral patterns which could be of particular interest for the identification of key factors with regard to abnormal behavior (e.g. tail biting).

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/659653</url>
<snippet>The authors describe a common but largely unrecognized mechanism that produces and exacerbates intergroup inequality: the diffusion of valuable practices with positive network externalities through social networks whose members differentially possess characteristics associated with adoption. The authors examine two cases: the first, to explore the mechanism's implications and, the second, to demonstrate its utility in analyzing empirical data. In the first, the diffusion of Internet use, network effects increase adoption's benefits to associates of prior adopters. An agent-based model demonstrates positive, monotonic relationships, given externalities, between homophily bias and intergroup inequality in equilibrium adoption rates. In the second, rural-urban migration in Thailand, network effects reduce risk to persons whose networks include prior migrants. Analysis of longitudinal individual-level migration data indicates that network homophily interacts with network externalities to induce divergence of migration rates among otherwise similar villages.

<title>Informal Water Tankers, Their Network Structure, and Drivers of Cooperation and Competition: A Case Study in Beirut, Lebanon</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2023.2246028</url>
<snippet>Areas with chronic water shortages rely on informal water tankers for daily water needs. Informal tankers operate outside the reach of the state, hence the quality and price of the services they provide and the pressure their activities inflict on water systems go largely unchecked. Informal tankers use their social relationships to manage water sources and operate like an informal network. Yet, little is known about the drivers that explain their relationships and their impact on the overall water system. We investigate these issues in the empirical case of Beirut (Lebanon) using 20 semi-structured interviews and social network analysis. We find that: cooperative and competitive relationships between tankers give rise to different network structures; the drivers of cooperation and competition are religion and seniority in the market; climate change affects informal water markets by increasing competition for wells and clients. We propose recommendations for practitioners and policy-makers, and future research.

<title>Foreign Capital and Economic Growth: A Social Network Analysis, 2001-2017</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/07311214211035150</url>
<snippet>Foreign direct investment (FDI) holds a substantial and rapidly growing presence across every region of the world. However, our understanding of how foreign capital impacts economic growth in receiving and investing countries remains in question, despite nearly five decades of research. Our study contributes to this long-standing debate by (1) applying social network analysis to the FDI-growth literature, (2) utilizing recently available bilateral data for a global sample of countries during the post-2000 period, and (3) examining the impact of both inward and outward foreign capital on economic growth. While conventional measures of FDI typically focus on investment volume, we argue that the network structure of investment relations may be equally-or more-important. We construct a global network of FDI during the 2001-2017 period, bringing together two data sets: (1) the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development's Bilateral FDI Statistics, and (2) the International Monetary Fund's Coordinated Direct Investment Survey. We then calculate network centrality scores that reflect each country's level of inward and outward embeddedness in the global FDI network. Drawing from a sample of 1,467 observations across 137 countries during the 2001-2017 period, we estimate two-way fixed effects models to examine the effect of FDI centrality on economic growth. Net of other predictors, we find that inward and outward centrality are positively-and independently-associated with growth, while more conventional measures of foreign capital display weaker and inconsistent effects.

<title>Networks, Percolation, and Consumer Demand</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3658</url>
<snippet>Understanding diffusion processes is key to market strategies as well as innovation and sustainability policies. In promoting new products and technologies, firms and governments need to understand the conditions favouring successful spread of these products. We propose a generic diffiusion model based on percolation theory. Our reference is a new product diffusion in a social network through word-of-mouth. Given that consumers differ in their reservation prices, a critical price exists that defines a phase transition froma no-diffusion to a diffusion regime. As consumer surplus is maximised just below a product's critical price, one can systematically compare the economic efficiency of network structures by investigating their critical price. Networks with lowclustering were themost efficient, because clustering leads to redundant information flows hampering effective product diffusion. We further showed that the more equal a society, the more efficient the diffusion process.

<title>The Dichotomy between Providing Services and Supporting Social Inclusion in the Network of Third Sector Social Service Organisations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.5477/cis/reis.178.83</url>
<snippet>Inter-organisational collaboration plays an important role in the provision of services by the third sector. In this article we analyse the relationships among 21 third sector organisations in Andalusia. Through social network analysis we evaluate centrality, cohesion, influence and brokerage in different relationship structures among these organizations. The results reveal the existence of two relational spheres: one consisting of third sector organisations that provide services to specific groups and the other of organisations that work on issues of social inclusion and participation. A limited number entities account for the majority of the relationship activities in the network, mediating between users, the third sector and public administration. These entities structure the relationships into clusters with high cohesion, facilitating control over resources and the convergence of objectives among organisations in the same sphere.

<title>Social network influence and market instability</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmateco.2008.10.002</url>
<snippet>Models of social networks depict individuals' dependency. They offer a systematic way to capture the connectedness and opinion formations in the complex web of interpersonal influences. This paper studies price stability of a capital market, where the dynamics of participants' opinion formations is formalized using social network models. Stability condition is derived. It is also identified how network structures are important in communications and in determining market stability. it is found that factors or highly-connected networks and balanced weight allocation on information sources can in fact be stabilizing. In applications, this study supports the view that the key to reduce the volatility behaviour of emerging-market securities lies in the development of an efficient investor base. It is suggested that one way to achieve this is by broadening and diversifying both the international and domestic investor categories for the underlying market. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

<title>Network embeddedness in illegal online markets: endogenous sources of prices and profit in anonymous criminal drug trade</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwab027</url>
<snippet>Although economic sociology emphasizes the role of social networks for shaping economic action, little research has examined how network governance structures affect prices in the unregulated and high-risk social context of online criminal trade. We consider how overembeddedness-a state of excessive interconnectedness among market actors-arises from endogenous trade relations to shape prices in illegal online markets with aggregate consequences for short-term gross illegal revenue. Drawing on transaction-level data on 16 847 illegal drug transactions over 14 months of trade in a 'darknet' drug market, we assess how repeated exchanges and closure in buyer-vendor trade networks nonlinearly influence prices and short-term gross revenue from illegal drug trade. Using a series of panel models, we find that increases in closure and repeated exchange raise prices until a threshold is reached upon which prices and gross monthly revenue begin to decline as networks become overembedded. Findings provide insight into the network determinants of prices and gross monthly revenue in illegal online drug trade and illustrate how network structure shapes prices in criminal markets, even in anonymous trade environments.

<title>The Social Origins of Networks and Diffusion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/681275</url>
<snippet>Recent research on social contagion has demonstrated significant effects of network topology on the dynamics of diffusion. However, network topologies are not given a priori. Rather, they are patterns of relations that emerge from individual and structural features of society, such as population composition, group heterogeneity, homophily, and social consolidation. Following Blau and Schwartz, the author develops a model of social network formation that explores how social and structural constraints on tie formation generate emergent social topologies and then explores the effectiveness of these social networks for the dynamics of social diffusion. Results show that, at one extreme, high levels of consolidation can create highly balkanized communities with poor integration of shared norms and practices. As suggested by Blau and Schwartz, reducing consolidation creates more crosscutting circles and significantly improves the dynamics of social diffusion across the population. However, the author finds that further reducing consolidation creates highly intersecting social networks that fail to support the widespread diffusion of norms and practices, indicating that successful social diffusion can depend on moderate to high levels of structural consolidation.

<title>Generating social capital for bridging ethnic divisions in the Balkans: Case studies of two Bosniak cities</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01419870500352397</url>
<snippet>One of the major goals of the international community's intervention into the Balkans is the rebuilding of "viable multiethnic societies". Such societies require support from a population that builds inclusive social capital. I applied social network theory to interethnic relations to help identify the conditions under which minorities could embark on this arduous task in divided, war-torn societies, like Bosnia-Herzegovina. Analysis of data from interviews and participant observation indicate that institutions support positive interethnic relationships when they help people to address practical concerns; allow for individual norms and repeated, mutually dependent interethnic interaction; are rooted in local culture; and are difficult for people to avoid. Nominally mixed urban workplaces and certain types of civic organizations, not advocacy groups or neighbourhoods, meet these criteria. These findings urge scholars working on the role of civil society in rebuilding divided post-conflict societies to look more closely at venues beyond voluntary organizations.

<title>Based on Fund Managers' Emotional Labor to Discuss the Effect of Social Network on Work Performance</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.33788/rcis.64.4</url>
<snippet>Interpersonal relationship is an important element for business activity in Chinese societies. Venture capital companies have invested in various industries in past years and the funds of most venture capital companies are not large that venture industry would form an investment network to construct the information flow channel with the network activity among managers through the social network. It does not simply enhance the contact with other potential partners, but is also the information source and resource acquisition method. The difference in fund managers' investment decision-making lies in individual characteristics as well as the position in the social network to further influence the investment performance. Aiming at fund managers in Beijing, the research results show 1.negative relations between social network and emotional labor, 2.negative relations between emotional labor and work performance, and 3.positive relations between social network and work performance. According to the results to propose suggestions, it is expected to assist in selecting good fund managers, help fund managers make correct decisions, and benefit enterprises creating competitive advantage.

<title>Granular Mining and Big Data Analytics: Rough Models and Challenges</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40010-018-0578-3</url>
<snippet>Data analytics in granular computing framework is considered for several mining applications, such as in video analysis, bioinformatics and online social networks which have all the characteristics of Big data. The role of granulation, lower approximation and r-f information measure is exhibited. While the lower approximation over a video sequence signifies the object model for unsupervised tracking, it characterizes the probability (relative frequency) of definite regions in ranking miRNAs for normal and cancer classification. For neural learning, the information on definite region is used as the initial knowledge for encoding while generating the networks through evolution. Granules considered are of different sizes and dimensions with fuzzy and crisp boundaries. The tracking method is effective in handling different ambiguous situations, e.g., overlapping objects, newly appeared object(s), multiple objects in different directions and speeds, in unsupervised mode. The ranking algorithm could find only 1&#37; miRNAs to result in significantly higher F-score than the entire set. Fuzzy-rough communities detected over the granular model of social networks are suitable in dealing with overlapping virtual communities in Big data. The knowledge encoding based on fuzzy-rough set provides superior performance than that of rough set. Future directions of research and challenges including the significance of z-numbers in precisiation of granules are stated. The article includes some of the results published elsewhere.

<title>A Network-Based Indicator of Travelers Performativity on Instagram</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-020-02326-7</url>
<snippet>The spread of Internet and online social media has created a huge amount of data able to provide new insights to researchers in different disciplinary fields, but it also presents new challenges for data science. Data arising from online social networks can be naturally coded as relational data in affiliation and adjacency matrices, then analyzed with social network analysis. In this study, we apply an interdisciplinary approach (based on automatic visual content analysis, social network analysis, and exploratory statistical techniques) to define and derive a suitable indicator for characterizing places, along with the online activities of travelers, in terms of sharing images. We envisage a novel storytelling perspective where stories are related to places and the narrative activity is realized through posting images. Specifically, we use data extracted from an online social network (i.e., Instagram) to identify travelers' paths among sites of interests. Starting from a large collection of pictures geolocalized in a pre-specified set of locations (i.e., five locations in the Campania region of Italy during the 2018 Christmas season), we use automatic alternative text to produce an ex-post taxonomy of images on the most recurrent themes emerging from pictures posted on Instagram. Quantitative measures defined on the co-occurrence of locations and the emerging themes are used to build a statistical indicator able to characterize paths among different locations as narrated from travelers' posts. The proposed analysis, presented and discussed along with real data, can be useful for stakeholders interested in the fields of policy-making, communication design, and territory profiling strategies.

<title>Selection on heritable social network positions is context-dependent in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23672-1</url>
<snippet>The evolvability of sociality requires that some variation in social groups is heritable. Experiments on fly social groups find that genotypic differences in network position are largely robust to changes in the environment flies experience, while selection on network position varies across environments. Social group structure is highly variable and can be important for nearly every aspect of behavior and its fitness consequences. Group structure can be modeled using social network analysis, but we know little about the evolutionary factors shaping and maintaining variation in how individuals are embedded within their networks (i.e., network position). While network position is a pervasive target of selection, it remains unclear whether network position is heritable and can respond to selection. Furthermore, it is unclear how environmental factors interact with genotypic effects on network positions, or how environmental factors shape selection on heritable network structure. Here we show multiple measures of social network position are heritable, using replicate genotypes and replicate social groups of Drosophila melanogaster flies. Our results indicate genotypic differences in network position are largely robust to changes in the environment flies experience, though some measures of network position do vary across environments. We also show selection on multiple network position metrics depends on the environmental context they are expressed in, laying the groundwork for better understanding how spatio-temporal variation in selection contributes to the evolution of variable social group structure.

<title>Twitter and divides in the Dutch parliament: social and political segregation in the following, @-mentions and retweets networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2024.2305159</url>
<snippet>MPs communication on Twitter with other MPs may facilitate forming cross-party solidarity networks and provide public micro deliberation but may also be segregated leading to information bubbles and political polarization. That party-based division lines are running through the online communication networks of politicians is a well-established finding in social media studies; however important knowledge gaps have remained on the complexity of Twitter's multilayered network developments and their interrelatedness with socio-demographic segregation. Here, we integrate the online-network literature with that on the political consequences of the digital architecture of social media platforms to theorize and scrutinize the extent to which and why Twitter following, @-mentioning and retweeting networks among MPs are segregated along party lines and sex, age and ethnicity. Our unique dynamic take allows us to rigorously study network segregation, including feedback mechanisms between Twitter layers, based on descriptive network statistics and SIENA analyses for Dutch MPs at three time points. The findings show that political segregation patterns are strongest within the retweet layer and weakest for @-mentions. The interrelations between the Twitter network layers aggravate party-based segregation over time. MP Twitter networks are not consistently segregated along social dimensions.

<title>Coordination in Dynamic Social Networks Under Heterogeneity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2010.509523</url>
<snippet>People often make choices or form opinions depending on the social relations they have, but they also choose their relations depending on their preferred behavior and their opinions. Most of the existing models of coevolution of networks and individual behavior assume that actors are homogeneous. In this article, we relax this assumption in a context in which actors try to coordinate their behavior with their partners. We investigate with a game-theoretic model whether social cohesion and coordination change when interests of actors are not perfectly aligned as compared to the homogeneous case. Using analytical and simulation methods we characterize the set of stable networks and examine the consequences of heterogeneity for social optimality and segregation in emerging networks.

<title>Networking Behavior as a Mediation in University Graduates' HEXACO Personality Effects on Job Search Outcomes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440221091818</url>
<snippet>Based on the individual difference and social network theory, this research proposed the mediation model, with job search networking behavior as a mediator in the links between six HEXACO personality dimensions and job search outcomes. A survey was implemented in a sample of 773 university graduates. The findings suggest that honesty-humility, extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience were positively, while emotionality was negatively, related to networking behavior. In turn, networking behavior was positively related to number of job interviews obtained and number of job offers received. Furthermore, the results showed the mediating role of networking behavior in the personality traits-job search outcomes relationships. The findings are discussed in both theory and practical implications.

<title>Bayesian inference of spreading processes on networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2018.0129</url>
<snippet>Infectious diseases are studied to understand their spreading mechanisms, to evaluate control strategies and to predict the risk and course of future outbreaks. Because people only interact with few other individuals, and the structure of these interactions influence spreading processes, the pairwise relationships between individuals can be usefully represented by a network. Although the underlying transmission processes are different, the network approach can be used to study the spread of pathogens in a contact network or the spread of rumours in a social network. We study simulated simple and complex epidemics on synthetic networks and on two empirical networks, a social/contact network in an Indian village and an online social network. Our goal is to learn simultaneously the spreading process parameters and the first infected node, given a fixed network structure and the observed state of nodes at several time points. Our inference scheme is based on approximate Bayesian computation, a likelihood-free inference technique. Our method is agnostic about the network topology and the spreading process. It generally performs well and, somewhat counter-intuitively, the inference problem appears to be easier on more heterogeneous network topologies, which enhances its future applicability to real-world settings where few networks have homogeneous topologies.

<title>Social networks and environmental outcomes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1523245113</url>
<snippet>Social networks can profoundly affect human behavior, which is the primary force driving environmental change. However, empirical evidence linking microlevel social interactions to large-scale environmental outcomes has remained scarce. Here, we leverage comprehensive data on information-sharing networks among large-scale commercial tuna fishers to examine how social networks relate to shark bycatch, a global environmental issue. We demonstrate that the tendency for fishers to primarily share information within their ethnic group creates segregated networks that are strongly correlated with shark bycatch. However, some fishers share information across ethnic lines, and examinations of their bycatch rates show that network contacts are more strongly related to fishing behaviors than ethnicity. Our findings indicate that social networks are tied to actions that can directly impact marine ecosystems, and that biases toward within-group ties may impede the diffusion of sustainable behaviors. Importantly, our analysis suggests that enhanced communication channels across segregated fisher groups could have prevented the incidental catch of over 46,000 sharks between 2008 and 2012 in a single commercial fishery.

<title>The geographical dynamics of global R&amp;D collaboration networks in robotics: Evidence from co-patenting activities across urban areas worldwide</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281353</url>
<snippet>The focus of this study is on the geography of robotics Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities. The objectives are, first, to identify hotspots in robotics R&amp;D worldwide, and second, to characterise structures and dynamics of global robotics R&amp;D collaboration networks through detailed geographical lenses of global urban areas. We use patents as marker for R&amp;D activities, and accordingly focus on technologically oriented R&amp;D, drawing on information from patents applied for between 2002 and 2016. We employ an appropriate search strategy to identify relevant robotics patents based on detailed levels of the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) and assign patents to more than 900 global urban areas based on the inventor addresses. The co-patent networks are examined from a Social Network Analysis (SNA) perspective by means of robotics co-patents, contributing to a global network where urban areas are the nodes inter-linked by joint inventive activities recorded in robotics patents. Global SNA measures illustrate structures and dynamics of the network as a whole, while local measures indicate the specific positioning and roles of urban areas in the network. The results are original in characterising the global spatial emergence of this generic new industry, highlighting prominent urban hotspots in terms of specialisation in robotics R&amp;D, pointing to a global shift reflected by the increasing role of emerging economies, in particular China. The global robotics R&amp;D has grown significantly both in total patenting and also in terms of R&amp;D collaboration activities between urban areas. Also, for the networks, growth is not equally distributed, but is rather characterised by significant spatial shifts, both in terms of cities declining or climbing up the specialisation ranking, but even more in terms of the spatial network structure.

<title>The dual mechanism of social networks on the relationship between internationalization and firm performance: Empirical evidence from china</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263674</url>
<snippet>The effects of social networks on the relationship between internationalization and firm performance have been well documented in the international literature, and two dimensions of social networks have also been identified: business ties and political ties. However, few efforts have been made to examine whether there are different mechanisms of business ties and political ties. Based on social network theory and boundary spanning theory, we build a model of a dual mechanism of social networks, and the business ties and political ties of social networks that correspond with information processing and the external representation of boundary spanning theory. Using the data of Chinese listed companies in 2005-2013 and 2013-2017 to test the model, the results indicate that (1) in the relationship between internationalization and firm performance, the role of social networks has a dual mechanism. (2) Business ties play a mediating role in the relationship between internationalization and firm performance. Business ties are conducive to a company's information acquisition and knowledge sharing and play the role of information processing. (3) Political ties play a U-shaped moderating role in the relationship between internationalization and firm performance and assume the role of external representation.

<title>What drives the adoption of climate change mitigation policy? A dynamic network approach to policy diffusion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11077-018-9332-6</url>
<snippet>The requirement of bottom-up action from all the countries to deal with climate change makes it necessary to analyze the factors influencing policy adoption. This article contributes to the policy literature by shedding light on the conditions, which incentivize countries to adopt more climate mitigation policies. The theoretical argument builds on the integrated approaches to study policy diffusion, which include both internal and external determinants as explanations for the adoption of policies. While previous applications typically operationalize the latter by regional proximity, this study highlights the added value of network dependencies capturing political and cooperative interactions across countries. The article finds that the adoption of climate policies is a matter of social influence. Countries are more likely to adopt policies if they cooperate with countries that have adopted more climate policies and are in a similar structural position to countries that are active in climate protection. This article not only is an important theoretical contribution to the policy literature but also enriches our methodological and empirical understanding of climate policy diffusion.

<title>Research on opinion polarization by big data analytics capabilities in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.101902</url>
<snippet>Opinion polarization in online social networks causes a lot of concerns on its social, economic, and political impacts, and is becoming an important topic for academic research. Based on the system theory, a theoretical framework on analyzing opinion polarization combining big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) is proposed. A web crawler is used to collect data from the Sina Weibo platform on the topic of "Tangping". Concerning the characteristics of the big data environment, social network analysis (SNA), machine learning, text clustering and content analysis are used to mine opinion polarization of "Tangping" on Weibo. Results show that social network users holding the same opinion indicate the phenomenon of aggregation. Although no influential users support the opinion of "Tangping" on Weibo, a high percentage of people advocate the idea. The supporting group has the most clusters while the opposing group has the highest density of keywords. The research contributes to the existing literature on applying BDAC to analyze online polarization from the perspective of the system from user behavior and interaction to topic clustering and keywords identification. The conceptual system framework shows superiority in the integration of information coordination of microsystem and exosystem. Guidance strategies are put forward to supplement the formation theory of opinion polarization and provide suggestions to reasonably regulate network group polarization.

<title>Modelling opinion dynamics in the age of algorithmic personalisation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-43830-2</url>
<snippet>Modern technology has drastically changed the way we interact and consume information. For example, online social platforms allow for seamless communication exchanges at an unprecedented scale. However, we are still bounded by cognitive and temporal constraints. Our attention is limited and extremely valuable. Algorithmic personalisation has become a standard approach to tackle the information overload problem. As result, the exposure to our friends' opinions and our perception about important issues might be distorted. However, the effects of algorithmic gatekeeping on our hyper-connected society are poorly understood. Here, we devise an opinion dynamics model where individuals are connected through a social network and adopt opinions as function of the view points they are exposed to. We apply various filtering algorithms that select the opinions shown to each user (i) at random (ii) considering time ordering or (iii) its current opinion. Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between such mechanisms and crucial features of real networks. We found that algorithmic filtering might influence opinions' share and distributions, especially in case information is biased towards the current opinion of each user. These effects are reinforced in networks featuring topological and spatial correlations where echo chambers and polarisation emerge. Conversely, heterogeneity in connectivity patterns reduces such tendency. We consider also a scenario where one opinion, through nudging, is centrally pushed to all users. Interestingly, even minimal nudging is able to change the status quo moving it towards the desired view point. Our findings suggest that simple filtering algorithms might be powerful tools to regulate opinion dynamics taking place on social networks.

<title>Bayesian testing of scientific expectations under exponential random graph models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.11.004</url>
<snippet>The exponential random graph (ERGM) model is a commonly used statistical framework for studying the determinants of tie formations from social network data. To test scientific theories under ERGMs, statistical inferential techniques are generally used based on traditional significance testing using p-values. This method-ology has certain limitations, however, such as its inconsistent behavior when the null hypothesis is true, its inability to quantify evidence in favor of a null hypothesis, and its inability to test multiple hypotheses with competing equality and/or order constraints on the parameters of interest in a direct manner. To tackle these shortcomings, this paper presents Bayes factors and posterior probabilities for testing scientific expectations under a Bayesian framework. The methodology is implemented in the R package BFpack. The applicability of the methodology is illustrated using empirical collaboration networks and policy networks.

<title>Mapping the connections of health professionals to COVID-19 myths and facts in the Australian Twittersphere</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2022.2032260</url>
<snippet>The spread of COVID-19 misinformation on social media has elicited concern amongst scholars, health agencies and governments owing to its potential harms to public health. This article addresses the question of how networks of Australian health professionals engaged with COVID-19 facts and myths on Twitter between August and October 2020. After reviewing selected literature on COVID-19 misinformation, we present our analytical choices and the methodology we used to constitute datasets of COVID-19 factual and mythical hashtags and of verified Australian health professional accounts (N:377). The article distinguishes between the capacities of 'actor-actants' and 'issue-actants,' and between the adoption of 'field' and 'contested' hashtags during a controversy. We identify categories of Australian health professional Twitter accounts such as GPs, nurses, specialists, public health professionals and researchers, and analyse the patterns of connections between these actor-actants and COVID-19 facts and myths. We find that these categories exhibit clearly distinct behaviour when tweeting or retweeting factual and mythical hashtags. Even though the rate of Australian health professionals' connection with myths in comparison to facts on Twitter is low, hashtags such as #hydroxychloroquine attracted significant engagement. We examine these hashtags' context and find that they were mainly being debunked, though a minority of accounts endorsed them. We analyse these adoption patterns, and critically assess the 'echo chamber effect.' We also consider public health and privacy implications for the dissemination of accurate information, for trust in health professionals during a pandemic, and for combatting misinformation.

<title>Beyond and Below Racial Homophily: ERG Models of a Friendship Network Documented on Facebook</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/653658</url>
<snippet>A notable feature of U. S. social networks is their high degree of racial homogeneity, which is often attributed to racial homophily-the preference for associating with individuals of the same racial background. The authors unpack racial homogeneity using a theoretical framework that distinguishes between various tie formation mechanisms and their effects on the racial composition of networks, exponential random graph modeling that can disentangle these mechanisms empirically, and a rich new data set based on the Facebook pages of a cohort of college students. They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e. g., students from "elite" backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily.

<title>Weighted Betweenness Preferential Attachment: A New Mechanism Explaining Social Network Formation and Evolution</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-29224-w</url>
<snippet>The dynamics of social networks is a complex process, as there are many factors which contribute to the formation and evolution of social links. While certain real-world properties are captured by the degree-driven preferential attachment model, it still cannot fully explain social network dynamics. Indeed, important properties such as dynamic community formation, link weight evolution, or degree saturation cannot be completely and simultaneously described by state of the art models. In this paper, we explore the distribution of social network parameters and centralities and argue that node degree is not the main attractor of new social links. Consequently, as node betweenness proves to be paramount to attracting new links - as well as strengthening existing links -, we propose the new Weighted Betweenness Preferential Attachment (WBPA) model, which renders quantitatively robust results on realistic network metrics. Moreover, we support our WBPA model with a socio-psychological interpretation, that offers a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind social network dynamics.

<title>Inadequate Interactions and Unbalanced Power Between Scientists and the Public in Chinese Knowledge Sharing Network: Social Network Analysis of the Topic of Genetically Modified Food on Zhihu</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393221087668</url>
<snippet>This study takes the scientific discussion about genetically modified food on Zhihu as an example, using the method of social network analysis to explore the interactions between Chinese scientists and the public online. The findings indicate that both scientists and non-scientists are inclined to interact with users with a similar identity. Cross-group interactions seem to be hard to achieve on Zhihu. Furthermore, compared with non-scientists, scientist users tend to hold significantly stronger digital social capital than non-scientists on Zhihu. It is suggested that the knowledge sharing network has not fully achieved the goal of effectively promoting equally science dialogue in China.

<title>Homophily of music listening in online social networks of China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.07.001</url>
<snippet>Homophily, ranging from demographics to sentiments, breeds connections in social networks, either offline or online. However, with the prosperous growth of music streaming services, whether homophily exists in online music listening remains unclear. In this study, two online social networks of the same group of active users who listened to complete songs over 1000 times and posted over 100 tweets are established, separately, in Netease Music and Weibo. Through presented multiple similarity measures, it is evidently demonstrated that homophily does exist in music listening for both online social networks. The unexpected listening similarity in Weibo also implies that knowledge from generic social networks can be confidently transferred to domain-oriented networks for context enrichment and algorithm enhancement. Comprehensive factors that might function in the formation of homophily are further probed, and many interesting patterns are profoundly revealed. It is found that female friends are more homogeneous in music listening and that positive and energetic songs significantly pull users close. Our methodology and findings shed light on realistic applications in online music services.

<title>Dynamics of group identification and multiculturalistic attitudes in school networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0038-6073-2024-2-247</url>
<snippet>We examine the role of two different forms of social orientations for the integration in adolescent's social networks. On the one hand, the identification with being German represents an aspect of social identity. On the other hand, we regard multiculturalism as a political orientation that diffuses through networks. We test, first, whether, in terms of homophily, the similarity of two individuals regarding these social orientations influences social contacts, and, second, whether these social orientations result from the social influence that persons exert in the friendship network. We use data from the CILS4EU project for our empirical analysis, from which we can use up to 40 networks of a maximum of 875 students to estimate co -evolution models for networks and behavior. The results show that mechanisms of both selection and influence are at work in the identification with being German. For example, on the one hand, a shared social identity increases the chances of contact, and on the other hand, adolescents tend to adapt their social identity to their friends. For multicultural attitudes, we find only the mechanism of influence. Here, the diffusion of these attitudes via social influence in networks essentially plays a role. For the generation of network contacts and thus for social integration, we find no effects. Regarding multicultural attitudes, we find only influence. Hence, with respect to these attitudes there seems to be no homophily. We conclude that unlike the identification with being German, multicultural attitudes are not a salient feature of group identities.

<title>The Core Might Change Anyhow We Define It: The Instability of Key Actors in Longitudinal Social Network Data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2024/3956877</url>
<snippet>Central actors or opinion leaders are in the right structural position to spread relevant information or convince others about adopting an innovation or behaviour change. Who is a central actor or opinion leader might be conceptualised in various ways. Widely accepted centrality measures do not take into account that those in central positions in the social network may change over time. A longitudinal comparison of the set and importance of opinion leaders is problematic with these measures and therefore needs a novel approach. In this study, we investigate ways to compare the stability of the set of central actors over time. Using longitudinal survey data from primary schools (where the members of the social networks do not change much over time) on advice-seeking and friendship networks, we find a relatively poor stability of who is in the central positions anyhow we define centrality. We propose the application of combined indices in order to achieve more efficient targeting results. Our results suggest that because opinion leaders may change over time, researchers should be careful about relying on simple centrality indices from cross-sectional data to gain and interpret information (for example, in the design of prevention programs, network-based interventions or infection control) and must rely on more diverse structural information instead.

<title>Is there a phenomenological network theory? Story, network and identity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>The term &gt;phenomenological network theory&lt; designates a body of sociological work from the past 20 years which focuses on the interplay of symbolic forms and social network structure. The approach centers on Harrison White and his students and followers. The essay analyzes whether the approach fits the requirements of a &gt;school&lt; of sociological theory in the sense of an &gt;invisible college&lt;. Phenomenological Network Theory is thus applied to itself by descri-bing the interplay of meaning and network structure in the network of its authors. The following questions are examined: Are the authors of this approach closely interlinked? Is there a clear core in the network or a differentiation into various subgroups? Is there a common collective identity? How does the approach emerge from the combination of various theoretical strands and in opposition to other strands in sociology? These questions are examined drawing on the various methods typical of the research associated with Phenomenological Network Theory. The essay comprises a narrative account of the history of the approach (in the context of other sociological theories), a formal analysis of the network of authors, and a qualitative analysis of interviews with the main authors.

<title>Symmetric core-cohesive blockmodel in preschool children's interaction networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226801</url>
<snippet>Researchers have extensively studied the social mechanisms that drive the formation of networks observed among preschool children. However, less attention has been given to global network structures in terms of blockmodels. A blockmodel is a network where the nodes are groups of equivalent units (according to links to others) from a studied network. It is already shown that mutuality, popularity, assortativity, and different types of transitivity mechanisms can lead the global network structure to the proposed asymmetric core-cohesive blockmodel. Yet, they did not provide any evidence that such a global network structure actually appears in any empirical data. In this paper, the symmetric version of the core-cohesive blockmodel type is proposed. This blockmodel type consists of three or more groups of units. The units from each group are internally well linked to each other while those from different groups are not linked to each other. This is true for all groups, except one in which the units have mutual links to all other units in the network. In this study, it is shown that the proposed blockmodel type appears in empirical interactional networks collected among preschool children. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the most often studied social network mechanisms can lead the global network structure to the proposed symmetric blockmodel type. The units' attributes are not considered in this study.

<title>Unbiased metrics of friends' influence in multi-level networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-015-0057-x</url>
<snippet>The spreading of information is of crucial importance for the modern information society. While we still receive information from mass media and other non-personalized sources, online social networks and influence of friends have become important personalized sources of information. This calls for metrics to measure the influence of users on the behavior of their friends. We demonstrate that the currently existing metrics of friends' influence are biased by the presence of highly popular items in the data, and as a result can lead to an illusion of friends influence where there is none. We correct for this bias and develop three metrics that allow to distinguish the influence of friends from the effects of item popularity, and apply the metrics on real datasets. We use a simple network model based on the influence of friends and preferential attachment to illustrate the performance of our metrics at different levels of friends' influence.

<title>Innovation network, knowledge absorption ability, and technology innovation performance--An empirical analysis of China's intelligent manufacturing industry</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0293429</url>
<snippet>Based on the social network theory, this study utilizes knowledge absorption capacity as the mediating variable and technology turbulence as the moderating variable; furthermore, it focuses on China's intelligent manufacturing industry data to explore the effect of the intelligent manufacturing enterprise innovation network on technology innovation performance and the regulating mechanism of technology turbulence. Based on the patent data obtained from Derwent Database (survey period: 2016-2020), the empirical analysis indicates the following: (1) Network relationship, network location, and network density are significantly and positively correlated with technology innovation performance; however, network size exerts no significant effect on technology innovation performance. (2) Network relationship strength, network location, and network density exert significantly positive effects on the two dimensions of knowledge absorption capacity, namely the In-degree and the Out-degree. Network size exerts no significant effect on knowledge absorption capacity. (3) Knowledge absorption capacity exerts a partial mediating effect on the relationship between innovation network and technology innovation performance. (4) The three dimensions of innovation network that exert a significant effect on technology innovation performance are positively correlated with the interaction terms of technology turbulence, which indicates that the interaction terms, namely innovation network and technology turbulence, exert a positive impact on technology innovation performance through knowledge absorption capacity, and that the moderating effect of technology turbulence exerts a role through knowledge absorption capacity. Finally, this study postulates implementations and policy proposals for enhancing the innovation performance of intelligent manufacturing enterprises.

<title>Tight knit under stress: colony resilience to the loss of tandem leaders during relocation in an Indian ant</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.150104</url>
<snippet>The movement of colonies from one nest to another is a frequent event in the lives of many social insects and is important for their survival and propagation. This goal-oriented task is accomplished by means of tandem running in some ant species, such as Diacamma indicum. Tandem leaders are central to this process as they know the location of the new nest and lead colony members to it. Relocations involving targeted removal of leaders were compared with unmanipulated and random member removal relocations. Behavioural observations were integrated with network analysis to examine the differences in the pattern of task organization at the level of individuals and that of the colony. All colonies completed relocation successfully and leaders who substituted the removed tandem leaders conducted the task at a similar rate having redistributed the task in a less skewed manner. In terms of network structure, this resilience was due to significantly higher density and outcloseness indicating increased interaction between substitute leaders. By contrast, leader-follower interactions and random removal networks showed no discernible changes. Similar explorations of other goal-oriented tasks in other societies will possibly unveil new facets in the interplay between individuals that enable the group to respond effectively to stress.

<title>The Spreading of Information in Online Social Networks through Cellular Automata</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/1890643</url>
<snippet>Epidemic dynamics in complex networks have been extensively studied. Due to the similarity between information and disease spreading, most studies on information dynamics use epidemic models and merely consider the characteristics of online social networks and individual's cognitive. In this paper, we propose an online social networks information spreading (OSIS) model combining epidemic models and individual's cognitive psychology. Then we design a cellular automata (CA) method to provide a computational method for OSIS. Finally, we use OSIS and CA to simulate the spreading and evolution of information in online social networks. The experimental results indicate that OSIS is effective. Firstly, individual's cognition affects online information spreading. When infection rate is low, it prevents the spreading, whereas when infection rate is sufficiently high, it promotes transmission. Secondly, the explosion of online social network scale and the convenience of we-media greatly increase the ability of information dissemination. Lastly, the demise of information is affected by both time and heat decay rather than probability. We believe that these findings are in the right direction for perceiving information spreading in online social networks and useful for public management policymakers seeking to design efficient programs.

<title>Exponential Random Graph Models: Modelling Relational Mechanisms in the Inter-organisational Network of the Czech Coal Subsystem</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.13060/csr.2023.046</url>
<snippet>This study provides the first comprehensive introduction to exponential random graph models (ERGM) in the Czech academic literature. In it we apply ERGM to a network of 68 organisations involved in the Czech coal policy subsystem. First, we summarise the major limitations of the statistical modelling of network data arising from the interdependencies among observations and explain principled solutions to them provided by ERGM. Next, we discuss ERGM's metatheoretical assumptions and their embeddedness within the broader context of social science research. We then introduce three types of relational mechanisms (endogenous, individual, and dyadic) operationalised as specific configurations, which we illustrate through the empirical example of an expert information network. Following a descriptive analysis we apply ERGM, breaking it down into three main steps: simulation, estimation, and estimation assessment. We provide a detailed interpretation of the model's development and results, along with recommendations for building a model and solutions to convergence failure problems. One important finding is that one predictor of the exchange of expert information is ideological homophily, which reduces the potential of expertise to seek compromise solutions. We close with a discussion of the results and ERGM extensions to apply to more complex types of network data such as bipartite and multiplex networks and valued and longitudinal data.

<title>Transitions of women's substance use recovery networks and 12-month sobriety outcomes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2020.04.003</url>
<snippet>Little is known about how the structure and composition of women's personal social networks (PSNs) combine to support recovery from substance use disorders, how PSNs change during early recovery, or how known covariates such as trauma, co-occurring mental health disorders, or treatment modality impact this relationship. This study used latent profile and transition analyses with 6 recovery-specific PSN indicators in a sample of women in early recovery (N = 377) to identify three PSN typologies in relation to abstinence outcomes over 12 months, and track transitions between the typologies at 0-6 and 6-12 months. Women in the Highly Connected type (14.3 &#37;) had tightly-knit networks, more sober alters, and fewer treatment-related alters. Women in the Treatment-Related type (49.3 &#37;) had looser-knit networks with more sober and sobriety-supporting alters and alters they know from treatment. Women in the At-Risk type (36.3 &#37;) had more isolates, few sobriety-supporting alters, and more alters with whom they used. Women in the Treatment-Related Sobriety Support type were significantly more likely to maintain sobriety by 12 months (B=-0.81; OR = 2.09, 95 &#37; CI [1.23-3.56]) than women in the At Risk type. Higher mean Trauma Symptom Checklist scores were positively related to membership in the At Risk type. The majority of women who transitioned did so by 6 months, with 41.6 &#37; transitioning then. Women in the At Risk group had the highest probability of transition (P = 0.55). Being in residential treatment (versus outpatient) predicted lower odds of transitioning (B = -0.81, p = .06). This study provides a framework for conducting longitudinal latent variable analysis with social network data, and offers a clinically-useful starting point for research on individualized, targeted, and stage-based interventions for women in recovery.

<title>Risk issue adoption in an online social movement field</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1620823</url>
<snippet>This article extends the field conceptualisation of social change and innovation adoption, which hinges upon the strategic capacities of actors, to the online environment. We focus on a key aspect of social movement organisations (SMOs), competition for members, resources and attention over an environmental risk issue. The incorporation of network theory enables us to map how the structural position of actors in the field is associated with their actions- for example, their response to an exogenous shock such as a new threat to the environment. We analyse how actors in the online environmental movement respond to the emergence of nanoscience and technology (NST) as a risk issue, and test the field theory hypothesis that dominated actors are more likely to adopt this issue in the early stages of emergence. Our findings challenge field theory orthodoxy and suggest that whilst challengers innovate, dominants co-opt by adopting the issue in a second stage. Finally, we examine why the notion that NST entails significant environmental and health risks was not propelled into wider public consciousness.

<title>An Assimilation Anomaly : Averaging-Induced Reversal of Overall Opinion in Two Interacting Societies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.5150</url>
<snippet>Assimilation - the tendency for individuals to adjust their opinions to more closely align with those around them - is one of the central components of computational social-influence and opinion-dynamics mod-els that seek to elucidate how large-scale societal trends can emerge from local social interactions among small groups of individuals. Although assimilation processes have been well studied using increasingly sophisticated assimilative schemes like bounded confidence, nonlinear opinion-averaging methodologies, time-varying so-cial network structures, etc., we show there is a surprising, previously unrecognized phenomenon lurking in even the simplest of assimilation models. We consider here two societies that start out on opposite sides of some opinion spectrum, for instance, one initially very conservative society and the other very liberal. We as-sume small groups of individuals from these societies can meet and interact, and that during an interaction each person's opinion simply moves closer to the average opinion of the group. One might anticipate that this barebones assimilation process - which involves nothing more than simple numerical averaging of opinions during each encounter - will invariably lead to a steady (and rather uninteresting) convergence of overall opin-ion among the two societies wherein the initial intersocietal differences are straightforwardly washed away. We show instead that a counterintuitive, large-scale demographic reversal can sometimes emerge - i.e., the two societies can potentially end up swapping their relative positions on the opinion spectrum, with the ini-tially conservative society ending up more liberal, on the whole, than the formerly liberal society. This finding (dubbed an "assimilation anomaly") shows how the process of repeatedly taking simple averages on a local level can induce an overall reversal of average opinion on a global level. Using a heat diffusion model from physics, we reveal the origins of this curious phenomenon. This dynamical effect involving two interacting so-cieties is wholly distinct from other interesting social-influence phenomena described in the opinion-dynamics literature (e.g., polarization, fragmentation, phase transitions, bifurcations, etc.).

<title>Social Network Analysis of Nonprofits in Disaster Response: The Case of Twitter During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393221130674</url>
<snippet>The COVID-19 pandemic has created complex problems that require organizations to collaborate within and across the sector line. Social media data can provide insights into how nonprofits interact for the pandemic response from both social network and geographical perspectives. This study innovatively investigated the connection and interaction patterns among 74 National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD) nonprofits and three government agencies based on structural analyses and content analyses of their Twitter communications during the long-term global COVID-19 pandemic. The daily tweeting quantities of all nonprofits were generally consistent with the pandemic severity in the United States before July 2020 and remained stable afterward. Nonprofits' tweets can reflect their purposes of sharing information, building communities, and taking actions for disaster response. Government agencies played leadership roles in providing COVID-19 guidelines and information. Human services, International and Foreign Affairs, and Public and Societal Benefit nonprofits, especially American Red Cross played central roles in the nonprofit communication network. Possible explanations include the following: (1) Geographically, connections and interactions among nonprofits are more likely to happen within the same city or in neighboring states. (2) Both mission homophily and heterophily contribute to connections and interactions among nonprofits, depending on their subsectors. The findings not only help the public better understand how nonprofits are collaboratively fighting the pandemic, but also provide guidance for nonprofits to plan for better interactions and communications in future disaster response.

<title>Homophily and Insularity Dynamics in an Echo Chambers: Computational Models for the Study of the Conspiracy Subculture in Facebook</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-024-03461-1</url>
<snippet>The research focuses on developing a computational model (agent-based) to describe and analyse the structure and evolution of a conspiracy bubble within Facebook. The methodological framework relies on a hypothesis, previously validated in other digital contexts, asserting that user groups interested in conspiracy topics form not isolated cliques but rather constitute a subculture characterised by a system of "subjective understanding" (Tucker, W. T. (1965). Max Weber's verstehen. Sociol Q, 6(2), 157-165) and specific interpretative categories (Russo &amp; Cecconi, Russo, V., Cecconi, F. (2023). Collettivi digitali e cultura della disinformazione. Analisi di una bolla cospirazionista durante la pandemia di Covid-19. Sociologia Italiana, (22).; Barkun, Barkun, A culture of conspiracy: Apocalyptic visions in contemporary America, University of California Press, 2013; Grusauskaite et al., Grusauskaite et al., New Media &amp; Society, 2023). In accordance with this hypothesis, the research design incorporates four types of entities: the conspiracy articles generated in the digital space, the websites where they come from, the public pages and groups where they are shared, and the users engaging with this content. The methodological process unfolds in two phases: (1) descriptive, data mining and analysis of the content and structure of a conspiracy bubble, along with the construction of a relational dataset; (2) experimental, development of the agent-based model, creation of scenarios, model validation, simulation, and subsequent data analysis. The research findings reveal a bubble comprising a singular component characterised by hub nodes functioning as cultural catalysts and specific interpretative categories shared among users. Simulation results show that the network fragments in response to changes in two article properties acting as 'glue': political orientation and the incitement of fear and hate.

<title>A network-based explanation of inequality perceptions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.02.007</url>
<snippet>Across income groups and countries, individual citizens perceive economic inequality spectacularly wrong. These misperceptions have far-reaching consequences, as it might be perceived inequality, not actual inequality informing redistributive preferences. The prevalence of this phenomenon is independent of social class and welfare regime, which suggests the existence of a common mechanism behind public perceptions. The literature has identified several stylised facts on how individual perceptions respond to actual inequality and how these biases vary systematically along the income distribution. We propose a network-based explanation of perceived inequality building on recent advances in random geometric graph theory. The generating mechanism can replicate all of aforementioned stylised facts simultaneously. It also produces social networks that exhibit salient features of real-world networks; namely, they cannot be statistically distinguished from small-world networks, testifying to the robustness of our approach. Our results, therefore, suggest that homophilic segregation is a promising candidate to explain inequality perceptions with strong implications for theories of consumption and voting behaviour.

<snippet>A burgeoning literature spanning sociologies of culture and social network methods has for the past several decades sought to explicate the relationships between culture and connectivity. A number of promising recent moves toward integration are worthy of review, comparison, critique, and synthesis. Network thinking provides powerful techniques for specifying cultural concepts ranging from narrative networks to classification systems, tastes, and cultural repertoires. At the same time, we see theoretical advances by sociologists of culture as providing a corrective to network analysis as it is often portrayed, as a mere collection of methods. Cultural thinking complements and sets a new agenda for moving beyond predominant forms of structural analysis that ignore action, agency, and intersubjective meaning. The notion of "cultural holes" that we use to organize our review points both to the cultural contingency of network structure and to the increasingly permeable boundary between studies of culture and research on social networks.

<title>People are scarier than ghosts? Workplace haters and knowledge sharing</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.13278</url>
<snippet>Objective.In the workplace, colleague relationship deeply affects employees' work attitude and behavior, but it is rarely taken seriously. Based on the cognitive-affective personality system theory and social network theory, this study examined the influence of three common workplace haters (negative gossiper, two-faced person, and loafer) on employee well-being and knowledge sharing and explores the moderating effect of organizational social capital. Method.The study used longitudinal design, three-wave, and 409 valid supervisor-employee pairs (233 direct supervisors and 409 employees) from 10 companies in Taiwan to test these hypothetical relationships. Results. The findings of this study showed that: (1) workplace haters negatively affects employee well-being; (2) employee well-being positively affects knowledge sharing; (3) employee well-being mediates the relationship between workplace haters and knowledge sharing; and (4) organizational social capital moderates the relationship between workplace haters and employee well-being. Conclusion. The study has important contributions to the literature on workplace haters, coworker interaction, and social capital. Implications for behavioral researchers and human resource managers are discussed.

<title>Heterosexual Marital Intention: The Influences of Confucianism and Stigma Among Chinese Sexual Minority Women and Men</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-021-02229-9</url>
<snippet>In traditional Confucianist culture in China, marriage and offspring are highly valued, placing sexual minority adults under tremendous pressure to marry an opposite sex partner. This study explored how Confucianism and stigma were associated with the intention to pursue a heterosexual marriage among Chinese sexual minority individuals as well as the moderating mechanisms of gender and age. Cross-sectional data were collected from 747 participants via online social networks from March to June 2020. Items assessed Confucianism values (communalism, filial piety, traditional gender roles); stigma (rejection sensitivity, social discrimination); and heterosexual marital intention (HMI). A total of 1.7&#37; (n = 12) participants had ever been married, 11.6&#37; (n = 87) planned to marry a different-sex partner, 60.4&#37; (n = 451) had no intention to pursue a heterosexual marriage, and 26.4&#37; (n = 197) had no specific marital plan. Bisexual participants scored significantly higher than homosexual individuals in HMI. Sexual minority adults with high levels of Confucianism and stigma were more likely to intend to marry. Importantly, both individual stigma (rejection sensitivity) and interpersonal stigma (social discrimination) partially mediated the relationship between Confucianism and HMI. Confucianism had a stronger impact on HMI for men than women, and age moderated the influence of Confucianism (including communalism and filial piety) on HMI, with a stronger impact for younger than older generations. This study contributes to a better understanding of how Confucianism and stigma may be connected to the intention to pursue a heterosexual marriage, suggesting culture-modified theories of stigma and sexual minority stress are needed to explain the experiences of sexual minority people in contemporary China.

<title>The equivalence of two rational expectations equilibrium economies with different approaches to processing neighbors' information</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2020.11.003</url>
<snippet>We consider a finite-agent Hellwig (1980) economy with an extension to allow traders to observe their neighbors' signals in an exogenously given social network. There are two potential approaches for traders to process observed signals: directly infer information about the fundamentals from the complete collection of observed signals, or indirectly from an average of observed signals. The two approaches lead to different information sets for traders. In this study, we investigate whether the two economies corresponding to the two approaches are equivalent in the sense that they have the same market equilibrium. For general network and signal structures, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for the equivalence, revealing that the two finite-agent economies are not equivalent in general unless the network structure and signal structure coordinate well. When traders have homogeneous preferences and the signal structure takes the classical form in the literature, we find that the two finite-agent economies are equivalent for regular graphs, but not for chain and star graphs. Finally, for the classical signal structure, we show that the two large economies, defined as the limit of a sequence of replica finite-agent economies, are equivalent for any network structure.

<title>Developing community structure on the sidelines: A social network analysis of youth sport league parents</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2018.11.011</url>
<snippet>The extant literature suggests that the formation of social networks within local communities may be linked to both positive (e.g., health, social well-being) and negative (e.g., social segregation or stratification) outcomes. In this study, we examine the social networks formed at the structural level by parents of community-based youth sport programs. Employing Quadratic Assignment Procedurest-test and Quadratic Assignment Procedures correlation, we empirically tested changes in recalled network density and homophily effects of parents (n= 391) at a community-level youth sport league located in the Southeastern USA. Our findings suggest that parents' social networks significantly increased in density from pre- to post-season. However, while we found no significant homophily effects based on socioeconomic characteristics, we did observe significant racial homophily effects for participants in basketball and baseball/softball.

<title>Social Network Dynamics in the Context of Age: An Empirical Investigation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-023-03210-w</url>
<snippet>This paper explores patterns and motivations for social tie formation and dissolution in the context of age. It provides empirical tests of the social convoy model, socioemotional selectivity theory, and the differential investment of resources (DIRe) model. Data comes from a survey administered face-to-face to a large, representative sample of the population of Poland (n = 1000). Controlling for between-tie and between-ego differences, it is found that the intensity of forming and dropping new ties is a decreasing function of age, but the relationship becomes weaker among people aged 40 and older. The number of social ties people maintain (degree) is also a decreasing function of age. However, the number of social ties with family, as opposed to coworkers and other acquaintances, is roughly constant across age groups. Young women, but not men, tend to form fewer ties if they are married. Both expressive and instrumental motivations for social tie formation are relatively most active in middle adulthood. The data also reveal a "rich get richer" effect: people with relatively high degree and a more central position in a social network tend to form more new ties and enlarge their social network over time.

<title>Overcoming Uncertainty in Novel Technologies: The Role of Venture Capital Syndication Networks in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Startup Investments in Korea and Japan</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems12030072</url>
<snippet>This paper investigates how historical inter-firm syndication networks influence venture capitalists' (VCs) propensity to invest in startups pursuing novel, uncertain technologies, with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI). We theorize that VCs' positional attributes within cumulative syndication networks determine their access to external expertise and intelligence that aid AI investment decisions amidst informational opacity. Specifically, reachability to prior AI investors provides referrals and insights transmitted across short network paths to reduce ambiguity. Additionally, VC brokerage between disconnected industry clusters furnishes expansive, non-redundant information that is pivotal for discovering and assessing AI opportunities. Through hypotheses grounded in social network theory, we posit network-based mechanisms that equip VCs to navigate uncertainty when engaging with ambiguous innovations like AI. We test our framework, utilizing comprehensive historical records of global venture capital investments. Analyzing the location information of VC firms in this database, we uncovered a history of 14,751 investments made by Korean and Japanese firms. Using these data, we assembled an imbalanced panel dataset from 1984 to 2022 spanning 230 Korean and 413 Japanese VCs, with 4508 firm-year observations. Negative binomial regression analysis of this dataset reveals how historical relational patterns among venture capital firms foster readiness to evaluate unfamiliar innovations.

<title>Evolution of Bounded Confidence Opinion in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2017/3173016</url>
<snippet>We investigate opinion dynamics as a stochastic process in social networks. We introduce the stubborn agent in order to determine the impact of network structure on the emergence of consensus. Depending on the fraction of undirected long-range connections, we observe fascinatingly rich dynamical behavior and transitions from disordered to ordered states. In general, we find that the stubborn agent promotes the emergence of consensus due to the so-called "group effect" that facilitates coalescence between separated network components. Agents are also behaviorally constrained Shannon information entropy in networks. However, since agents want to evolve their opinion with Brownian motion, which may in turn impede full consensus, sufficiently frequent long-range links are in such situations crucial for the network to converge into an absorbing phase. Our experimental findings indicate that, for a large range of control parameters, our model yields stable and fluctuating polarized states.

<title>The role of geography in the complex diffusion of innovations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-72137-w</url>
<snippet>The urban-rural divide is increasing in modern societies calling for geographical extensions of social influence modelling. Improved understanding of innovation diffusion across locations and through social connections can provide us with new insights into the spread of information, technological progress and economic development. In this work, we analyze the spatial adoption dynamics of iWiW, an Online Social Network (OSN) in Hungary and uncover empirical features about the spatial adoption in social networks. During its entire life cycle from 2002 to 2012, iWiW reached up to 300 million friendship ties of 3 million users. We find that the number of adopters as a function of town population follows a scaling law that reveals a strongly concentrated early adoption in large towns and a less concentrated late adoption. We also discover a strengthening distance decay of spread over the life-cycle indicating high fraction of distant diffusion in early stages but the dominance of local diffusion in late stages. The spreading process is modelled within the Bass diffusion framework that enables us to compare the differential equation version with an agent-based version of the model run on the empirical network. Although both model versions can capture the macro trend of adoption, they have limited capacity to describe the observed trends of urban scaling and distance decay. We find, however that incorporating adoption thresholds, defined by the fraction of social connections that adopt a technology before the individual adopts, improves the network model fit to the urban scaling of early adopters. Controlling for the threshold distribution enables us to eliminate the bias induced by local network structure on predicting local adoption peaks. Finally, we show that geographical features such as distance from the innovation origin and town size influence prediction of adoption peak at local scales in all model specifications.

<title>It Takes Two: The Interplay of Individual and Group Theology on Social Embeddedness</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01427.x</url>
<snippet>Prior research argues that religious homophily in social networks is a product of overlapping interests and activities unintentionally leading to relationships or the intentional seeking of relationships with people of similar religious beliefs. This article advances research on religious homophily by including the role that exclusive theological beliefs play in explaining religious homophily among friends. We lay out three propositions for individual-, congregational-, and cross-level effects on the relationship between exclusive theology and embeddedness within one's congregation. Using multilevel models and data from the U.S. Congregational Life Survey (USCLS), we find support for our three propositions. We discuss our findings in terms of how exclusive theologies may contribute to bonding forms of social capital, but limit exposure to diverse social perspectives and bridging forms of social capital.

<title>Adoption and adaptation: A computational case study of the spread of Granovetter's weak ties hypothesis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.01.001</url>
<snippet>How do new scientific ideas diffuse? Computational studies reveal how network structures facilitate or obstruct diffusion; qualitative studies demonstrate that diffusion entails the continuous translation and transformation of ideas. This article bridges these computational and qualitative approaches to study diffusion as a complex process of continuous adaptation. As a case study, we analyze the spread of Granovetter's Strength of Weak Ties hypothesis, published in American Journal of Sociology in 1973. Through network analysis, topic modeling and a close reading of a diffusion network created using Web of Science data, we study how different communities in this network interpret and develop Granovetter's hypothesis in distinct ways. We further trace how these communities originate, merge and split, and examine how central scholars emerge as community leaders or brokers in the diffusion process.

<title>Topological measures for identifying and predicting the spread of complex contagions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24704-6</url>
<snippet>The standard measure of distance in social networks - average shortest path length - assumes a model of "simple" contagion, in which people only need exposure to influence from one peer to adopt the contagion. However, many social phenomena are "complex" contagions, for which people need exposure to multiple peers before they adopt. Here, we show that the classical measure of path length fails to define network connectedness and node centrality for complex contagions. Centrality measures and seeding strategies based on the classical definition of path length frequently misidentify the network features that are most effective for spreading complex contagions. To address these issues, we derive measures of complex path length and complex centrality, which significantly improve the capacity to identify the network structures and central individuals best suited for spreading complex contagions. We validate our theory using empirical data on the spread of a microfinance program in 43 rural Indian villages. Understanding of complex contagions is crucial for explaining diffusion processes in networks. Guilbeault and Centola introduce topological mechanisms and measures to elucidate spreading dynamics and identify the most influential nodes in social, epidemic and economic networks.

<title>Are older adults networked individuals? Insights from East Yorkers' network structure, relational autonomy, and digital media use</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1428659</url>
<snippet>Networked individualism is a critical concept about the transition of the societal shift from geographically bounded local groups to the contemporary network society comprised of sparse, permeable, and dynamic communication networks. An underlying assumption about networked individuals thus far in the literature is that they are at a younger age. There are fears that older adults have been left behind in this transition to networked individualism. In this study, we are the first to inquire to what extent and in what ways are older adults networked individuals. Using in-depth interviews with 41 older adults living in the East York area of Toronto, we used a combination of quantitative coding, thematic analysis, and individual profiling to analyze their social network structure, relational autonomy, and digital media use. Our findings render a rather complex and nuanced picture, showing three types of older adults along the spectrum of networked individualism: networked individuals, socially connected but not networked individuals, and socially constrained individuals. Although most participants are socially connected, those who are networked individuals actively manage and navigate multiple, diverse, and non-redundant social networks. Digital media use is neither necessary nor sufficient in qualifying a person as a networked individual as the great majority of East Yorkers even if not networked individuals integrate digital media into their everyday lives.

<title>Does Qualitative Network Analysis Exist?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Social network analysis was formed and established in the 1970s as a way of analyzing systems of social relations. In this review the theoretical-methodological standpoint of social network analysis ("structural analysis") is introduced and the different forms of social network analysis are presented. Structural analysis argues that social actors and social relations are embedded in social networks, meaning that action and perception of actors as well as the performance of social relations are influenced by the network structure. Since the 1990s structural analysis has integrated concepts such as agency, discourse and symbolic orientation and in this way structural analysis has opened itself. Since then there has been increasing use of qualitative methods in network analysis. They are used to include the perspective of the analyzed actors, to explore networks, and to understand network dynamics. In the reviewed book, edited by Betina HOLLSTEIN and Florian STRAUS, the twenty predominantly empirically orientated contributions demonstrate the possibilities of combining quantitative and qualitative methods in network analyses in different research fields. In this review we examine how the contributions succeed in applying and developing the structural analysis perspective, and the self-positioning of "qualitative network analysis" is evaluated.

<title>Research disciplinary interactions on scientific collaboration network in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution: Characteristics and dynamics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266404</url>
<snippet>Interdisciplinary scientific collaboration promotes the innovative development of scientific research. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) is a typical interdisciplinary subject. This study aims to explore the characteristics of discipline interaction and the temporal evolution in the field. Bibliometric analysis could be used to understand the stage of research in a particular subject. In this work, the publications on the topic in Web of Science (WoS) platform from 1999 to 2020 were selected. On the basis of social network theory, the characteristics of interdisciplinary were revealed from three perspectives. First, the disciplinary interaction network is constructed through disciplinary co-occurrence to detect the characteristics of interaction structure among different disciplines. Then the node centrality index is employed to explore the influence of disciplines in the interactive network by using network centrality analysis. Moreover, the dynamic of discipline interaction evolution is studied using blockmodeling analysis. In the field of PHE, the number of disciplines and the intensity of interaction among different subjects gradually increased in the past 20 years. Chemistry and Material Sciences are the core discipline, and they play an important role in the network. The whole network is divided into different discipline groups. The scale of the discipline group is becoming large, and the disciplinary interaction is becoming more complex. The obtained results are helpful for guiding scholars to carry out interdisciplinary interaction. The methods of detecting interdisciplinary interactive relationship could provide paths for interdisciplinary research in other fields.

<title>Exploring influential nodes using global and local information</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26984-4</url>
<snippet>In complex networks, key nodes are important factors that directly affect network structure and functions. Therefore, accurate mining and identification of key nodes are crucial to achieving better control and a higher utilization rate of complex networks. To address this problem, this paper proposes an accurate and efficient algorithm for critical node mining. The influential nodes are determined using both global and local information (GLI) to solve the shortcoming of the existing key node identification methods that consider either local or global information. The proposed method considers two main factors, global and local influences. The global influence is determined using the K-shell hierarchical information of a node, and local influence is obtained considering the number of edges connected by the node and the given values of adjacent nodes. The given values of adjacent nodes are determined based on the degree and K-shell hierarchical information. Further, the similarity coefficient of neighbors is considered, which enhances the differentiation degree of the adjacent given values. The proposed method solves the problems of the high complexity of global information-based algorithms and the low accuracy of local information-based algorithms. The proposed method is verified by simulation experiments using the SIR and SI models as a reference, and twelve typical real-world networks are used for the comparison. The proposed GLI algorithm is compared with several common algorithms at different periods. The comparison results show that the GLI algorithm can effectively explore influential nodes in complex networks.

<title>Using Ego Network Data to Inform Agent-based Models of Diffusion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0049124118769100</url>
<snippet>Agent-based modeling holds great potential as an analytical tool. Agent-based models (ABMs) are, however, also vulnerable to critique, as they often employ stylized social worlds, with little connection to the actual environment in question. Given these concerns, there has been a recent call to more fully incorporate empirical data into ABMs. This article falls in this tradition, exploring the benefits of using sampled ego network data in ABMs of cultural diffusion. Thus, instead of relying on full network data, which can be difficult and costly to collect, or no empirical network data, which is convenient but not empirically grounded, we offer a middle-ground, one combining ABMs with recent work on network sampling. The main question is whether this approach is effective. We provide a test of the approach using six complete networks; the test also includes a range of diffusion models (where actors follow different rules of adoption). For each network, we take a random ego network sample and use that sample to infer the full network structure. We then run a diffusion model through the known, complete networks, as well as the inferred networks, and compare the results. The results, on the whole, are quite strong: Across all analyses, the diffusion curves based on the sampled data are very similar to the curves based on the true, complete network. This suggests that ego network sampling can, in fact, offer a practical means of incorporating empirical data into an agent-based model.

<title>The Company You Keep: How Network Disciplinary Diversity Enhances the Productivity of Researchers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642221127242</url>
<snippet>The Covid-19 pandemic has affected most organizations' working environment and productivity. Organizations have had to make arrangements for staff to operate remotely following the implementation of lockdown regulations around the world, as the pandemic has led to restrictions on movement and the temporary closure of workplace premises. The purpose of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of the effect of this transition on productivity during the pandemic, by studying a distributed network of research who collaborate remotely. We examine how the productivity of researchers is affected by the distributed collaborative networks in which they are embedded. Our goal is to understand the effects of brokerage and closure on the researchers' publication rate, which is interpreted as an indicator of their productivity. We analyze researchers' communication networks, focusing on structural holes and diversity. We take into account the individual qualities of the focal researcher such as seniority. We find that disciplinary diversity among researchers' peers increases the researchers' productivity, lending support to the brokerage argument. In addition, we find support for two statistical interaction effects. First, structural holes moderate diversity so that researchers with diverse networks are more productive when their networks also have a less redundant structure. Diversity and structural holes, when combined, further researchers' productivity. Second, seniority moderates diversity such that senior researchers are more productive than junior researchers in less diverse networks. In more diverse networks, junior researchers perform as well as senior researchers. Social capital and human capital are complementary. We conclude that the benefits of diversity on researchers' productivity are contingent on the qualities of the researchers and on network structure. The brokerage/closure debate thus needs a more nuanced understanding of causal relationships.

<title>Evolution Characteristics of the Network Core in the Facebook</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0104028</url>
<snippet>Statistical properties of the static networks have been extensively studied. However, online social networks are evolving dynamically, understanding the evolving characteristics of the core is one of major concerns in online social networks. In this paper, we empirically investigate the evolving characteristics of the Facebook core. Firstly, we separate the Facebook-link(FL) and Facebook-wall(FW) datasets into 28 snapshots in terms of timestamps. By employing the k-core decomposition method to identify the core of each snapshot, we find that the core sizes of the FL and FW networks approximately contain about 672 and 373 nodes regardless of the exponential growth of the network sizes. Secondly, we analyze evolving topological properties of the core, including the k-core value, assortative coefficient, clustering coefficient and the average shortest path length. Empirical results show that nodes in the core are getting more interconnected in the evolving process. Thirdly, we investigate the life span of nodes belonging to the core. More than 50&#37; nodes stay in the core for more than one year, and 19&#37; nodes always stay in the core from the first snapshot. Finally, we analyze the connections between the core and the whole network, and find that nodes belonging to the core prefer to connect nodes with high k-core values, rather than the high degrees ones. This work could provide new insights into the online social network analysis.

<title>An empirical study on social network analysis for small residential communities in Gangwon State, South Korea</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-62371-x</url>
<snippet>Social Network Analysis (SNA) provides a dynamic framework for examining interactions and connections within networks, elucidating how these relationships impact behaviors and outcomes. This study targeted small residential communities in Gangwon State, South Korea, to explore network formation theories and derive strategies for enhancing health promotion services in rural communities. Conducted in 12 small residential areas, the survey led to a network categorization model distinguishing networks as formal, informal, or non-existent. Key findings demonstrated that demographic and socio-economic factors, specifically age, income, living environment, leisure activities, and education level, significantly influence network formation. Importantly, age, environmental conditions, satisfaction with public transportation, and walking frequency were closely associated with the evolution of formal networks. These results highlight the importance of early community network assessments, which must consider distinct network traits to develop effective health promotion models. Utilizing SNA early in the assessment process can improve understanding of network dynamics and optimize the effectiveness of health interventions.

<snippet>This review integrates diverse characterizations of creativity from a sociological perspective with the goal of reinvigorating discussion of the sociology of creativity. We start by exploring relevant works of classical social theory to uncover key assumptions and principles, which are used as a theoretical basis for our proposed definition of creativity: an intentional configuration of cultural and material elements that is unexpected for a given audience. Our argument is enriched by locating creativity vis-a-vis related concepts-such as originality, knowledge, innovation, atypicality, and consecration-and across neighboring disciplines. Underlying the discussion are antecedents (structure, institutions, and context) and consequences (audiences, perception, and evaluation), which are treated separately. We end our review by speculating on ways in which sociologists can take the discussion of creativity forward.

<title>Estimation and variable selection for high-dimensional spatial data models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2023.105605</url>
<snippet>Spatiotemporal modeling of networks is of great practical importance, with modern applications in epidemiology and social network analysis. Despite rapid methodological advances, how to effectively and efficiently estimate the parameters of spatial dynamic panel models remains a challenging problem. To tackle this problem, we construct consistent complex least-squares estimators by the eigendecomposition of a spatial weight matrix method originally proposed for undirected networks. We no longer require all eigenvalues and eigenvectors to be real, which is a remarkable achievement as it implies that the proposed method is now applicable to spatiotemporal data modeling of directed networks. Under mild, interpretable conditions, we show that the proposed parameter estimators are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. We also present a complex orthogonal greedy algorithm for variable selection and rigorously investigate its convergence properties. Moreover, we incorporate fixed effects into the spatial dynamic panel models and provide a model transformation so that the proposed method can also be applied to the transformed model. Extensive simulation studies and data examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<title>A Study on the Spatial Correlation Effects of Digital Economy Development in China from a Non-Linear Perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems11020063</url>
<snippet>Accurate analysis of the spatial correlation effects, spatial aggregation patterns, and critical factors in the development of China's digital economy is of great significance to the high-quality development of China's economy. Based on the monthly data of "The Tencent Internet Plus" digital economy index for 31 provinces in China from 2018 to 2020, the non-linear Granger causality test and social network analysis were applied to reveal the spatial correlation effects of China's digital economy. The quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) was used to empirically examine the factors influencing the formation of non-linear spatial association networks. The results show that the spatially linked relationships of the digital economy in 31 Chinese provinces exhibit a significant non-linear spatially correlated network structure. Block model analysis reveals that the development of the digital economy between the four major sectors is closely linked, and the national linkage effect is significant. The results of the secondary assignment procedure indicate that capital stock, information infrastructure, and geographical proximity have a significant positive impact on the formation of spatial linkages in the digital economy. In contrast, technological innovation has a significant negative impact.

<title>Local Majority-with-inertia Rule Can Explain Global Consensus Dynamics in A Network Coordination Game</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.01.013</url>
<snippet>We study how groups reach consensus by varying communication network structure and individual incentives. In 342 networks of seven individuals, single opinionated "leaders" can drive decision outcomes, but do not accelerate consensus formation, whereas conflicting opinions slow consensus. While networks with more links reach consensus faster, this advantage disappears under conflict. Unopinionated individuals make choices consistent with a local majority rule combined with "inertia" favouring their previous choice, while opinionated individuals favour their preferred option but yield under high peer or time pressure. Simulations show these individual rules can account for group patterns, and allow rapid consensus while preventing deadlocks.

<title>Low status rejection: How status hierarchies influence negative tie formation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.08.005</url>
<snippet>Scholarship investigating how social status patterns negative ties has yielded contradictory findings. Three likely sources for these differences are: different measures of social status, measures of negative ties (perceived versus dyadic), and structural factors. This study uses multiple measures of social status, sociometrically-measured negative ties, and multiple analytic approaches - MRQAP to control for structure and within-individual to control for heterogeneity - to help resolve this debate. We find: negative ties travel down status hierarchies and target low status individuals, and a negative tie between two people becomes more likely as their status difference increases. These results suggest a low-status rejection mechanism.

<title>CONCEPTUALIZING NETWORKS AS ASSEMBLAGES A case study from the Spanish ceramics sector</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/ris.2009.06.29</url>
<snippet>Network structures are being used to explain social interactions within and between organisations in many ways that have become very influential. Many of the sociological features of organisations are captured very effectively by network descriptions, but such descriptions also retain serious limitations. Some network theories, for example, are composed of fragmented and internally inconsistent theories, while others depend upon essentialist and reductionist models. Perhaps a more serious problem is that networks describe relationships rather than explain the mechanisms through which these relationships function. This paper introduces the notion of assemblages as a corrective to these problems. The concept offers a clear, though suitably complex, framework with which to clarify the dynamics and structures that afford engagement and enable collective action among diverse elements of organisations. Using brief examples from recent research in the innovation literature, supported by an empirical case study in the Spanish ceramics sector, this paper will illustrate how reconceptualising network relationships in terms of their assemblages enables a more robust and consistent theoretical grounding for network research.

<title>Dense and influential core promotion of daily viral information spread in political echo chambers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86750-w</url>
<snippet>Despite the intensive study of the viral spread of fake news in political echo chambers (ECs) on social networking services (SNSs), little is known regarding the underlying structure of the daily information spread in these ECs. Moreover, the effect of SNSs on opinion polarisation is still unclear in terms of pluralistic information access or selective exposure to opinions in an SNS. In this study, we confirmed the steady, highly independent nature of left- and right-leaning ECs, both of which are composed of approximately 250,000 users, from a year-long reply/retweet network of 42 million Japanese Twitter users. We found that both communities have similarly efficient information spreading networks with densely connected and core-periphery structures. Core nodes resonate in the early stages of information cascades, and unilaterally transmit information to peripheral nodes. Each EC has resonant core users who amplify and steadily spread information to a quarter of a million users. In addition, we confirmed the existence of extremely aggressive users of ECs who co-reply/retweet each other. The connection between these users and top influencers suggests that the extreme opinions of the former group affect the entire community through the top influencers.

<title>What are friends for? Elective communities of single people</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2008.07.001</url>
<snippet>The paper presents the results of a qualitative research on friendship networks of single people. The research has been undertaken using social network analysis tools (egonetworks) and qualitative interviews, on a non-representative sample of 23 heterosexual singles of Milan, aged between 25 and 35 years, 12 male and 11 female. Framed within the theory of community, we formulated some questions that are addressed through the analysis: the role of friendship in single people's everyday life, which in some cases substitutes the traditional family as a source of emotional, social, material and economical support; the possibility that friendship is not always intended as a source of support, and people can name friends even if they do not provide any kind of support; the effect of the network structure on the strength of dyads, that will easily disconnect if not embedded in a cohesive network. Four different kinds of friendship networks have been found: the small cliques, the company, the core/periphery structure, and the contextualised components. In the discussion section, empirical findings are analysed focusing on different strategies of friendship, and special attention is given to the gender issue. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

<title>Investigating the Relative Influence of Genes and Memes in Healthcare</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>The process by which genes and memes influence behaviour is poorly understood. Genes generally may have a strong influence as predispositions directing individuals towards certain behaviours; whereas memes may have a less direct influence as information inputs to cognitive processes determining behaviour. In certain areas of medical science, knowledge has progressed towards approximate quantification of genetic influences, while social psychology can provide models of mimetic influence as the spread of attitudes. This paper describes a computational model integration of genetic and mimetic influences in a healthcare domain. It models mimetic influences of advertising and health awareness messages in populations with genetic predispositions towards obesity; environmental variables influence both gene expression and mimetic force. Sensitivity analysis using the model with different population network structures is used to investigate the relative force of meme spread and influence.

<title>Network Structure and Influencing Factors of Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Spatial Correlation Network-A Study Based on Data from 30 Provinces in China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12111773</url>
<snippet>Based on the perspective of the value chain of agricultural science and technology innovation, in this paper, we divided the process of agricultural science and technology innovation into two stages: the Research and Development (R&amp;D) of agricultural technology and the application of agricultural technology. We took the efficiency of agricultural science and technology innovation of the two stages as a comprehensive index measure for the development of agricultural science and technology innovation in China. On this basis, we used social network analysis to establish a two-stage spatial correlation network for the innovation development of agricultural science and technology in China. The spatial-temporal evolution trends, structural characteristics, and influencing factors of the network were analyzed from the three aspects of the overall, local, and individual network structure. The results show that: a. The development of agricultural science and technology innovation in China demonstrated a clear spatial correlation and spillover effect, and the spatial correlation network was in a connected state. b. The network had the distribution characteristics of 'core-edge' and strong stability, and the hierarchical structure of the members of each province in the network was gradually broken. c. The differences at the market level in agricultural science and technology, the differences in government support for agriculture, the geographically adjacent relationships, and the level of agricultural economic development were important factors affecting the spatial correlation of agricultural science and technology innovation. This study provides a policy reference to use a cross-regional coordinated development mechanism to solve the uneven and asymmetry problem of the distribution of elements in various regions in China.

<title>Breaking the Treadmill? Climate Change Policy Networks and the Prospects for Low Carbon Futures in Australia and Finland</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2020.1802540</url>
<snippet>The Treadmill of Production Theory (TPT) argues that in advanced capitalist societies, business organizations, trade unions, and state actors form a constellation that prioritizes economic growth over environmental concerns. We combine this perspective with the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) and use methods of social network analysis, survey data on key organizations in Finland and Australia, and in-depth interviews to map the policy network structures that resist low carbon transitions, and identify potential for change in these structures. We find that a coalition of economic, labor, and governmental organizations resists a low carbon transition in both countries. However, we also find several possible avenues of incremental change through changes in the network structures and the beliefs held by actors in the networks. Theoretically, this suggests that the TPT is correct in its diagnosis of the current situation, but the ACF may be a more fruitful perspective for identifying potential for change.

<title>Product development team formation: effects of organizational- and product-related factors</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-019-09302-8</url>
<snippet>Although the performance of new product development (PD) is dependent on the structure and formation of design teams, effective configuration of the PD teams remains largely unexplored. According to social network research, teams are often organized in either closely connected or sparse structure. We conceptualize PD projects as collective problem-solving endeavors and develop a computational model of these projects where a number of designers conduct search over an NK(C) performance landscape. We group the designers in teams with closely connected or sparse structure. We also consider various organizational integration capabilities (i.e., coordinated operations, and common principles) as well as interaction networks among the teams (i.e., acyclical, cyclical, and modular). We use simulation and compare the design performance of teams with different configurations. Our results indicate that the extent by which organizations can effectively integrate design solutions determines the team structure and is likely to result in higher development performance. In addition, the design performance of strategies that employ both closely connected and sparse teams is contrasted with the strategies that use either of these structures. Regardless of the integration capabilities of the PD projects, strategies that simultaneously utilize both closely connected and sparse teams are likely to achieve higher development performance than strategies that only use teams with one particular structure.

<title>THE FLOW OF INFORMATION THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORKS - DIAGONAL-FREE MEASURES OF INEFFICIENCY AND THE STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS OF INEFFICIENCY</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-8733(94)90011-6</url>
<snippet>The aim of this paper is to (1) propose specific diagonal-free measures of the inefficiency of information flow through social networks and (2) present an analysis of the structural determinants of inefficiency. We employ a formal model of collective action developed by Coleman (1973, 1990); link it to the Markov model of interpersonal influence developed by among others French (1956), Harary (1959), and Friedkin (1991; Friedkin and Johnsen 1990); and extend it to measure inefficiency in information flow based on the concept of mean first passage times. It is shown that structural characteristics of social networks - such as global density, local density, diameter, number of bridges, and inequality in centrality, and certain interactions among these variables - strongly affect inefficiency. Theoretical implications of the results are discussed.

<title>Destination eWOM: A macro and meso network approach?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2017.02.007</url>
<snippet>The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework that describes the characteristics and the underlying drivers of publically shared electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) for destinations. Tweets about a destination were collected while the destination hosted a hallmark event over a 5-year period (2011-2015). In each year, interactions on Twitter were analysed using macro and meso-level social network analysis to identify the network structure and hubs of eWOM activity. A K means clustering algorithm was then applied to create clusters of nodes with similar characteristics and eWOM content within each cluster was analysed using automated content analysis. The resulting model indicates that destination and event eWOM maintains a macro network structure in which a small number of accounts or hubs influence information sharing. Hub characteristics evolve over time, whereas eWOM content can fluctuate in response to emergent destination activities. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

<title>The shaping of social and symbolic capital during the transition to farming in the Western Mediterranean: Archaeological network analyses of pottery decorations and personal ornaments</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0294111</url>
<snippet>Storing information and circulating it between individuals and groups is a critical behaviour that signals a tipping point in our evolutionary history. Such practices enabled the preservation and consolidation of knowledge over extended periods, facilitating the accumulation of cultural innovations across generations. In this study, we used Social Network Analysis methods to explore how knowledge circulated during the transition to agriculture in the Western Mediterranean region. Previous studies have shown that specific elements of the material culture reveal distinct patterns of cultural interaction among early farming communities. Here, we investigated if two archaeological proxies, personal ornaments and pottery decorations, both with an exclusively symbolic function, reveal different network structures, and if the different degree of connexions acted equally on the transmission of styles, symbols, and network changes over time. Our results relied on cultural data recorded from 77 archaeological occupations covering Italy, France, and Spain, spanning over 1,500 years (ca. 7950 similar to 6450 cal BP). By utilizing a chronological dataset comprising 114 radiocarbon dates, we revealed that pottery decorative techniques networks exhibited stronger connexions over space and time, with nodes organized in clear cluster, when compared to personal ornaments networks. The findings highlight the regionalization and fragmentation of cultural networks during the Early Neolithic, and that the transmission of cultural traits within each category of artefact operated through varying cultural and social mechanisms. Pottery expressed a dynamic regional identity, continuously shaped by geographical and chronological proximity, while bead-type associations contributed to enduring identities shared across vast geographical scales. These networks shed light on the multifaceted shaping of social and symbolic capital among the Mediterranean's early farmers, emphasizing the strength and quality of social ties that existed between communities and the level of reciprocity and cooperation required to foster these diverse social, economic, and cultural development strategies.

<title>Big Data and Political Social Networks: Introducing Audience Diversity and Communication Connector Bridging Measures in Social Network Theory</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439315617262</url>
<snippet>Social media have changed the way citizens, journalists, institutions, and activists communicate about social and political issues. However, questions remain about how information is diffused through these networks and the degree to which each of these actors is influential in communicating information. In this study, we introduce two novel social network measures of connection and information diffusion that help shed light on patterns of political communication online. The Audience Diversity Score assesses the diversity of a particular actor's followers and identifies which actors reach different publics with their messages. The Communication Connector Bridging Score highlights the most influential actors in the network who are potentially able to connect different spheres of communication through their information diffusion. We apply and discuss these measures using Twitter data from the discussion regarding the Transatlantic Trade Investment Partnership in Europe. Our results provide unique insights into the role various actors play in diffusing political information in online social networks.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-015-9189-6</url>
<snippet>This paper compares a firm's innovation and performance with its online Web presence measured through the Web network structure. 489 firms in five different industries listed on the United States and Chinese stock markets are investigated. Using Web link data collected from Bing, blogs, Twitter and Wikipedia, we find positive correlation between betweenness centrality of a firm in the Web network and its innovation capability; and between betweenness centrality and financial performance. In order to get more accurate forecasting results, regression analysis is done for each industry and the combined industries in the United States and China. We also find that Twitter and Wikipedia only predict a firm's performance in the United States, which is not surprising as they are officially blocked in China. Blogs predict better in China than they do in the United States, as it might still be a major social media tool for Chinese firms; while for the US firms, blogs have been supplemented by Twitter and Wikipedia.

<title>Opinion transmission in organizations: an agent-based modeling approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-013-9161-2</url>
<snippet>This paper builds a theoretical framework to detect the conditions under which social influence enables persistence of a shared opinion among members of an organization over time, despite membership turnover. It develops agent-based simulations of opinion evolution in an advice network, whereby opinion is defined in the broad sense of shared understandings on a matter that is relevant for an organization's activities, and on which members have some degree of discretion. We combine a micro-level model of social influence that builds on the "relative agreement" approach of Deffuant et al. (J. Artif. Soc. Simul. 5:4, 2002), and a macro-level structure of interactions that includes a flow of joiners and leavers and allows for criteria of advice tie formation derived from, and grounded in, the empirical literature on intra-organizational networks. We provide computational evidence that persistence of opinions over time is possible in an organization with joiners and leavers, a result that depends on circumstances defined by mode of network tie formation (in particular, criteria for selection of advisors), individual attributes of agents (openness of newcomers to influence, as part of their socialization process), and time-related factors (turnover rate, which regulates the flow of entry and exit in the organization, and establishes a form of endogenous hierarchy based on length of stay). We explore the combined effects of these factors and discuss their implications.

<title>Social Network Services as Data Sources and Platforms for e-Researching Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439309332291</url>
<snippet>Social network services such as Facebook provide new data for social science research into, for example, the role of individual characteristics in friendship formation and the diffusion of tastes in social networks. This article assesses the potential of social network services for social science research in two ways. First, it is argued that social scientists conduct hyperlink analysis differently to applied physicists and researchers from the library and information sciences, and face constraints (relating to theory, methods and availability of appropriate tools) that are not encountered in the other disciplinary approaches. However, the constraints regarding theory and methods are less likely to be faced by researchers of online social networks, and for this reason, the rise of Facebook and other similar services is a potential boon for empirical social scientists interested in networks. The second part of the article focuses specifically on the availability of research tools, and it is argued that social network services may eventually serve as e-Research platforms for delivering social network analysis tools.

<title>Neighborhood co-offending networks, structural embeddedness, and violent crime in Chicago</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2016.12.003</url>
<snippet>Neighborhood disparities in crime are a persistent feature of U.S. cities. Scholars have documented that both local structural conditions and characteristics of spatially proximate communities influence neigh-borhood crime rates. Previous studies on neighborhood inequality in crime, however, are limited by their focus on identifying average spillover effects between pairs of spatially contiguous neighborhoods, and have neglected to consider how the broader social organization of the city influences local outcomes. This study examines the role of neighborhood-level criminal networks in shaping the distribution of crime throughout cities. Employing arrest records and survey data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, we construct a neighborhood-level co-offending network for Chicago for 2001. We use this network to investigate how a focal neighborhood's homicide rate is influenced by its structural embeddedness within the larger inter -neighborhood co-offending network. Results indicate that a neighborhood's embeddedness increases the local homicide rate, even after controlling for the neighborhood's internal propensity toward crime and accounting for unobserved spatial processes.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03298</url>
<snippet>People's posting behaviors in social networks was perceived as ambiguous, with concerns misaligned with people's public postings. To address this gap, we suggest a model that offers new insights into the relationship between perceptions and actual behaviors. We define a quantitative marker for agility, the frequency in which people update their audience selection when posting information in online social networks, and evaluate the factors that contribute to the variability of agility between different users. We analyzed the posting behavior of Facebook 181 participants, as well as their answers to open and close questions. We find that frequent changes in privacy settings are correlated with high social privacy and with institutional privacy concerns, whereas social concerns were found to be more prominent. Agility was negatively correlated with low public sharing. Our findings show that users use privacy settings to effectively mitigate privacy concerns and desires for creating and strengthening social connections. We discuss how agility can be used to design and to evaluate new user interfaces for managing privacy in social settings.

<title>Identifying the roles of race-based choice and chance in high school friendship network formation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0911793107</url>
<snippet>Homophily, the tendency of people to associate with others similar to themselves, is observed in many social networks, ranging from friendships to marriages to business relationships, and is based on a variety of characteristics, including race, age, gender, religion, and education. We present a technique for distinguishing two primary sources of homophily: biases in the preferences of individuals over the types of their friends and biases in the chances that people meet individuals of other types. We use this technique to analyze racial patterns in friendship networks in a set of American high schools from the Add Health dataset. Biases in preferences and biases in meeting rates are both highly significant in these data, and both types of biases differ significantly across races. Asians and Blacks are biased toward interacting with their own race at rates &gt; 7 times higher than Whites, whereas Hispanics exhibit an intermediate bias in meeting opportunities. Asians exhibit the least preference bias, valuing friendships with other types 90&#37; as much as friendships with Asians, whereas Blacks and Hispanics value friendships with other types 55&#37; and 65&#37; as much as same-type friendships, respectively, and Whites fall in between, valuing other-type friendships 75&#37; as much as friendships with Whites. Meetings are significantly more biased in large schools (&gt; 1,000 students) than in small schools (&lt; 1,000 students), and biases in preferences exhibit some significant variation with the median household income levels in the counties surrounding the schools.

<title>Patterns of ties in problem-solving networks and their dynamic properties</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75221-3</url>
<snippet>Understanding the functions carried out by network subgraphs is important to revealing the organizing principles of diverse complex networks. Here, we study this question in the context of collaborative problem-solving, which is central to a variety of domains from engineering and medicine to economics and social planning. We analyze the frequency of all three- and four-node subgraphs in diverse real problem-solving networks. The results reveal a strong association between a dynamic property of network subgraphs-synchronizability-and the frequency and significance of these subgraphs in problem-solving networks. In particular, we show that highly-synchronizable subgraphs are overrepresented in the networks, while poorly-synchronizable subgraphs are underrepresented, suggesting that dynamical properties affect their prevalence, and thus the global structure of networks. We propose the possibility that selective pressures that favor more synchronizable subgraphs could account for their abundance in problem-solving networks. The empirical results also show that unrelated problem-solving networks display very similar local network structure, implying that network subgraphs could represent organizational routines that enable better coordination and control of problem-solving activities. The findings could also have potential implications in understanding the functionality of network subgraphs in other information-processing networks, including biological and social networks.

<snippet>Enterprise social network sites (ESNSs) are increasingly being introduced into large multinational organizations. In this article, we consider their potential for supporting knowledge-sharing practices within the organization. First, we build on prior work on affordances by applying notions of collective affordances and affordances for organizing to the study of social media, and we theorize how ESNSs may provide organizational affordances for knowledge sharing in distributed multinational organizations in particular. Second, we articulate ways in which ESNS affordances may shape knowledge sharing through consideration of social capital dynamics, support for relationships and interactions, context collapse, and network interactions. Finally, and building on these ideas, we propose a research agenda and suggestions for future research on this topic.

<title>A Social Network Analysis on Venture Capital Alliance's Exit from an Emerging Market</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/4650160</url>
<snippet>This study investigated the impacts of network structure on a venture capital (VC) alliance's successful exit from an emerging market by empirically analyzing joint VC data in China. We find that, compared to a mature capital market, the mechanism not only has a certain commonality but also shows the emerging market's particularities. From the commonality perspective, the mechanism has a positive effect on successful exit by obtaining heterogeneity information. These particularities are manifested in the following three aspects. First, the mechanism is not conducive to deepening the enterprise value chain to establish credibility by obtaining short-term cash during an initial public offering with the enhancement of the VC alliance's intervention ability for enterprise development. In addition, a VC alliance's independent judgment is bound by the VC market. Furthermore, the problem of over-trust in investees reduces the likelihood of a VC alliance's successful exit. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the particularity of emerging markets such as China to improve the relevant management mechanism.

<title>Subject to Evaluation: How Parents Assess and Mobilize Information from Social Networks in School Choice</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/socf.12483</url>
<snippet>A rich literature examines how information spreads through social networks to influence life opportunities. However, receiving information does not guarantee its use in decision making. This article analyzes information evaluation as a fundamental component of social network mobilization. The case of school choice, where the value of information may be more uncertain, brings this evaluative dimension to the forefront. Interviews with 55 parents in Boston show how parents selecting schools assess their social network ties as information sources, privileging information from those they perceive to have affinity and authority. These evaluative criteria map onto disparate networks to engender unequal mobilization of this information. The findings illuminate mechanisms sustaining inequality in social network mobilization and reorient scholars to consider processes underlying information use alongside information diffusion to attain a more complete understanding of how network resources are mobilized in action.

<title>What Drives Sustainable Brand Awareness: Exploring the Cognitive Symmetry between Brand Strategy and Consumer Brand Knowledge</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12020198</url>
<snippet>The explosive development of social media has given great opportunities to academic and industry research on consumer brand knowledge. Particularly, the brand associative network has been most frequently used to describe consumer brand knowledge structure. However, few researchers have examined the embedded connotation of the brand knowledge structural measurement in regard to sustainable brand performance and adjusted their brand strategies accordingly. Combining psychological cognitive theory and the network analytic method, this paper aims to extend this area by investigating the relationship between brand structural position in consumers' associative knowledge network and sustainable brand awareness. Using a monthly dataset of around 130 million user posts, we find that compared to a prior determined brand strategy, brand network centrality in consumer's brand associative knowledge network shows a much more significant positive effect on sustainable brand awareness. Importantly, we further examined the symmetric matching of brand positioning strategy and consumer's brand knowledge structure for sustainable brand awareness. We find that sustainable brand awareness will be promoted by a symmetric matching brand positioning strategy with its position in the associative knowledge work. Our study facilitates an understanding of brands based on consumer perceptions for managers and enables businesses to adjust their relevant strategies for the achievement of sustainable brand performance.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85555-1</url>
<snippet>Misinformation is usually adjusted to fit distinct narratives and propagates rapidly through social networks. False beliefs, once adopted, are rarely corrected. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, pandemic-deniers and people who oppose wearing face masks or quarantine have already been a substantial aspect of the development of the pandemic. With the vaccine for COVID-19, different anti-vaccine narratives are being created and are probably being adopted by large population groups with critical consequences. Assuming full adherence to vaccine administration, we use a diffusion model to analyse epidemic spreading and the impact of different vaccination strategies, measured with the average years of life lost, in three network topologies (a proximity, a scale-free and a small-world network). Then, using a similar diffusion model, we consider the spread of anti-vaccine views in the network, which are adopted based on a persuasiveness parameter of anti-vaccine views. Results show that even if anti-vaccine narratives have a small persuasiveness, a large part of the population will be rapidly exposed to them. Assuming that all individuals are equally likely to adopt anti-vaccine views after being exposed, more central nodes in the network, which are more exposed to these views, are more likely to adopt them. Comparing years of life lost, anti-vaccine views could have a significant cost not only on those who share them, since the core social benefits of a limited vaccination strategy (reduction of susceptible hosts, network disruptions and slowing the spread of the disease) are substantially shortened.

<title>How social ties transcend class boundaries? Network variability as tool for exploring occupational homophily</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2020.02.003</url>
<snippet>The research on social network analysis established the existence of class homophily, the tendency that personal networks are homogeneous in the class sense, as one of the governing patterns. This is explained via two main mechanisms: choice homophily and induced homophily. But the literature focused less on the question how can class boundaries be transgressed and what are the channels of class heterophily. This paper explores class heterophily on Croatian data acquired through position generator, which measures social capital (resources captured in social relations) by exploring the range of different occupational positions which are accessible to an individual (extensity index). Network variability is thereby taken as proxy for class composition of personal networks. The paper concludes that that political participation and sociability enable cross-class ties, since this offers an opportunity to meet and befriend people from all walks of life; and that people on the middle of the social hierarchy have the most diverse social networks. The hypotheses that social mobility can represent a vehicle for class heterophily; and that class heterophily is more pronounced in smaller settlements, where society networks show more overlap between social circles; were confirmed only partially, and require further investigation. These findings concern class boundaries related to the notion of choice homophily. As for induced homophily, the paper concludes that here too the boundaries are not watertight, as cultural omnivores have a wider range of class contacts.

<title>The Impact of Herding Tendency in Modular Networks on the Diffusion of Internet Investment Products</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12020318</url>
<snippet>In this paper, we aim to study the impact of the shift in herding tendency on the diffusion of internet investment products in modular social networks. The epidemic spreading mechanism is applied and numerical analyses are conducted. The results suggest that the increase in herding tendency slows down the diffusion process and postpones the outbreak time of the diffusion, but such negative effects can be compromised when the independent acceptance willingness is high. When independent acceptance willingness is low, the limited extent of the herding tendency increases the diffusion scope. In addition, the expansion of the propagation lifetime or the increase of the clustering coefficient increases the threshold so that the herding tendency has an effect on outbreak size. Further, the growth of the herding propensity tends to magnify the positive influence of the clustering coefficient and the negative effect of the modularity.

<title>Harvesting connections: the role of stakeholders' network structure, dynamics and actors' influence in shaping farmers' markets</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-024-10563-6</url>
<snippet>Farmers' markets (FMs) represent a crucial player in urban food systems, being the interconnection of local agricultural production and consumption, and serving as spaces for both economic exchange and community building. Despite their transformative potential, there is a scarcity of research that comprehensively investigates the dynamics of FMs network structure and the influence of the actors shaping FMs. The present article delves into the network of relationships within FMs in the Italian city of Bologna. This study adopts the Social Network Analysis (SNA) methodology applied with the Net-Map tool. The research objectives are to visualise the underlying network structure, map the dynamics, and identify the key actors who play pivotal roles in Bologna's FMs and their level of influence. The research carried out interviews with ten FMs stakeholders, revealing the network of relationships between 54 actors, divided into three categories-civil society, food economy and public administration. Actors were linked by a total of 428 relationships across three types of networks: support, economic, and hindering. Findings indicate a strong support network structure characterised by varying degrees of centrality among different actors. Farmers emerge as a central node due to their pivotal role in providing fresh, local produce. Additionally, local institutions contribute significantly to FMs resilience and growth. Our research demonstrates the importance of recognising the embeddedness of FMs within the local context. By understanding the network structure and influential actors in FMs, policymakers can devise more effective policies for promoting local agriculture, and enhancing the sustainability of urban-rural exchanges. In conclusion, the present study offers valuable insights into the network dynamics of FMs, highlighting their crucial role in the sustainable development of urban and local food systems.

<title>Social threat learning transfers to decision making in humans</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1810180116</url>
<snippet>In today's world, mass-media and online social networks present us with unprecedented exposure to second-hand, vicarious experiences and thereby the chance of forming associations between previously innocuous events (e.g., being in a subway station) and aversive outcomes (e.g., footage or verbal reports from a violent terrorist attack) without direct experience. Such social threat, or fear, learning can have dramatic consequences, as manifested in acute stress symptoms and maladaptive fears. However, most research has so far focused on socially acquired threat responses that are expressed as increased arousal rather than active behavior. In three experiments (n = 120), we examined the effect of indirect experiences on behaviors by establishing a link between social threat learning and instrumental decision making. We contrasted learning from direct experience (i.e., Pavlovian conditioning) (experiment 1) against two common forms of social threat learning-social observation (experiment 2) and verbal instruction (experiment 3)-and how this learning transferred to subsequent instrumental decision making using behavioral experiments and computational modeling. We found that both types of social threat learning transfer to decision making in a strong and surprisingly inflexible manner. Notably, computational modeling indicated that the transfer of observational and instructed threat learning involved different computational mechanisms. Our results demonstrate the strong influence of others' expressions of fear on one's own decisions and have important implications for understanding both healthy and pathological human behaviors resulting from the indirect exposure to threatening events.

<title>Social influence or selection? Peer effects on the development of adolescents' educational expectations in Germany</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01425692.2020.1763163</url>
<snippet>Educational expectations are a key predictor of educational attainment. Throughout adolescence, friends increasingly function as 'significant others' and, thus, can affect the development of these expectations. Although scholars often interpret the clustering of students with similar expectations within friendship networks as the outcome of peer influence, a similarity of friends can also be a result of friendship selection processes and preselection due to ability tracking. We apply multilevel social network models to panel data of adolescents from Germany (1,992 ninth-grade students in 91 classes) to disentangle these mechanisms. Beyond selecting similar friends (homophily), we find that adolescents adapt their expectations towards the average expectations of their friends (social influence) but only in secondary-school tracks that support diverse educational paths. We conclude that peer socialization is important for the development of students' educational expectations in contexts that are sufficiently heterogeneous to allow for the emergence of distinct peer milieus.

<title>Game Changer: The Topology of Creativity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/681213</url>
<snippet>This article examines the sociological factors that explain why some creative teams are able to produce game changers-cultural products that stand out as distinctive while also being critically recognized as outstanding. The authors build on work pointing to structural folding-the network property of a cohesive group whose membership overlaps with that of another cohesive group. They hypothesize that the effects of structural folding on game changing success are especially strong when overlapping groups are cognitively distant. Measuring social distance separately from cognitive distance and distinctiveness independently from critical acclaim, the authors test their hypothesis about structural folding and cognitive diversity by analyzing team reassembly for 12,422 video games and the career histories of 139,727 video game developers. When combined with cognitive distance, structural folding channels and mobilizes a productive tension of rules, roles, and codes that promotes successful innovation. In addition to serving as pipes and prisms, network ties are also the source of tools and tensions.

<title>Measuring and mitigating behavioural segregation using Call Detail Records</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-020-00222-1</url>
<snippet>The overwhelming amounts of data we generate in our daily routine and in social networks has been crucial for the understanding of various social and economic factors. The use of this data represents a low-cost alternative source of information in parallel to census data and surveys. Here, we advocate for such an approach to assess and alleviate the segregation of Syrian refugees in Turkey. Using a large dataset of mobile phone records provided by Turkey's largest mobile phone service operator, Turk Telekom, in the frame of the Data 4 Refugees project, we define, analyse and optimise inter-group integration as it relates to the communication patterns of two segregated populations: refugees living in Turkey and the local Turkish population. Our main hypothesis is that making these two communities more similar (in our case, in terms of behaviour) may increase the level of positive exposure between them, due to the well-known sociological principle of homophily. To achieve this, working from the records of call and SMS origins and destinations between and among both populations, we develop an extensible, statistically-solid, and reliable framework to measure the differences between the communication patterns of two groups. In order to show the applicability of our framework, we assess how house mixing strategies, in combination with public and private investment, may help to overcome segregation. We first identify the districts of the Istanbul province where refugees and local population communication patterns differ in order to then utilise our framework to improve the situation. Our results show potential in this regard, as we observe a significant reduction of segregation while limiting, in turn, the consequences in terms of rent increase.

<title>Birds of a Feather: A Case Study of Friendship Networks of Mainland Chinese College Students in Hong Kong</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764215580616</url>
<snippet>We examine the formation process of friendship networks of Mainland Chinese undergraduates in Hong Kong. The data comes from a 2011 survey of Mainland undergraduates at a university in Hong Kong and from in-depth interviews with students. We found a strong in-group pattern in the friendship networks of these students. More than 60&#37; do not have good local friends. On a campus where nearly 90&#37; of the students are locals, on average, only 18&#37; of the good friends named by Mainland students are locals. We find that cultural differencessuch as the language barrier, differences in values and ideologies, and differences in academic orientation and future plandiscourage formation of intergroup friendship. But intergroup contacts, as indicated by participation in local organizations, have positive effects on intergroup friendship formation. Both contact opportunities and their timing (i.e., when they become available) are important. During their first year, Mainland students have many more opportunities to interact with other Mainlanders than with local students. This may also be an important factor accounting for the strong in-group pattern in Mainland students' friendship networks.

<title>Strategic complementarities, network games and endogenous network formation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00182-015-0466-x</url>
<snippet>This paper investigates the role of strategic complementarities in the context of network games and network formation models. In the general model of static games on networks, we characterize conditions on the utility function that ensure the existence and uniqueness of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, regardless of the network structure. By applying the game to empirically-relevant networks that feature nestedness-Nested Split Graphs-we show that equilibrium strategies are non-decreasing in the degree. We extend the framework into a dynamic setting, comprising a game stage and a formation stage, and provide general conditions for the network process to converge to a Nested Split Graph with probability one, and for this class of networks to be an absorbing state. The general framework presented in the paper can be applied to models of games on networks, models of network formation, and combinations of the two.

<title>The "Majority Illusion" in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147617</url>
<snippet>Individual's decisions, from what product to buy to whether to engage in risky behavior, often depend on the choices, behaviors, or states of other people. People, however, rarely have global knowledge of the states of others, but must estimate them from the local observations of their social contacts. Network structure can significantly distort individual's local observations. Under some conditions, a state that is globally rare in a network may be dramatically over-represented in the local neighborhoods of many individuals. This effect, which we call the "majority illusion," leads individuals to systematically overestimate the prevalence of that state, which may accelerate the spread of social contagions. We develop a statistical model that quantifies this effect and validate it with measurements in synthetic and real-world networks. We show that the illusion is exacerbated in networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution and disassortative structure.

<title>Deciphering the laws of social network-transcendent COVID-19 misinformation dynamics and implications for combating misinformation phenomena</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-89202-7</url>
<snippet>The global rise of COVID-19 health risk has triggered the related misinformation infodemic. We present the first analysis of COVID-19 misinformation networks and determine few of its implications. Firstly, we analyze the spread trends of COVID-19 misinformation and discover that the COVID-19 misinformation statistics are well fitted by a log-normal distribution. Secondly, we form misinformation networks by taking individual misinformation as a node and similarity between misinformation nodes as links, and we decipher the laws of COVID-19 misinformation network evolution: (1) We discover that misinformation evolves to optimize the network information transfer over time with the sacrifice of robustness. (2) We demonstrate the co-existence of fit get richer and rich get richer phenomena in misinformation networks. (3) We show that a misinformation network evolution with node deletion mechanism captures well the public attention shift on social media. Lastly, we present a network science inspired deep learning framework to accurately predict which Twitter posts are likely to become central nodes (i.e., high centrality) in a misinformation network from only one sentence without the need to know the whole network topology. With the network analysis and the central node prediction, we propose that if we correctly suppress certain central nodes in the misinformation network, the information transfer of network would be severely impacted.

<title>Structural characteristics and proximity comparison of China's urban innovation cooperation network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255443</url>
<snippet>How to promote and improve the level of urban innovation cooperation is a major issue in China's current high-quality economic development. Thus, enhancing innovation ability is essential to achieving high-quality economic growth under the "new normal". Based on the data of Chinese invention patents from 1985 to 2017, this paper analyzes the characteristics of China's urban innovation cooperation network and the different roles of proximity by using social network analysis and exploratory spatial data analysis methods. The analysis results show that: (1) On the whole, the development of China's urban innovation cooperation network is characterized by stages (initial development stage, rapid development stage, and gradual decline stage); The urban innovation cooperation network has strong connectivity and centripetal concentration but its imbalance needs to be further improved; The degree of urban participation has gradually increased, consolidating the stability of the network structure. (2) The centrality of urban innovation cooperation network has obvious characteristics of administrative center orientation, coastal areas orientation, and 'strong east and weak west'; Beijing is the center and bridge of the network, and the network flattening characteristics are obvious; A hierarchical 'core-edge' structure is gradually formed for the urban innovation cooperation network, and the pyramid structure with Beijing standing at the top is being consolidated. (3) The geographical proximity presents a significant global spatial positive correlation, while the network proximity and pure network proximity have a more significant global spatial negative correlation; The local spatial autocorrelation of China's urban innovation cooperation system based on network proximity is more obvious and identifiable than that based on the geographical proximity, which better reflects the new development model of "relationship economy".

<title>Expanding the measurement of culture with a sample of two billion humans</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2022.0085</url>
<snippet>Culture has played a pivotal role in human evolution. Yet, the ability of social scientists to study culture is limited by the currently available measurement instruments. Scholars of culture must regularly choose between scalable but sparse survey-based methods or restricted but rich ethnographic methods. Here, we demonstrate that massive online social networks can advance the study of human culture by providing quantitative, scalable and high-resolution measurement of behaviourally revealed cultural values and preferences. We employ data across nearly 60 000 topic dimensions drawn from two billion Facebook users across 225 countries and territories. We first validate that cultural distances calculated from this measurement instrument correspond to traditional survey-based and objective measures of cross-national cultural differences. We then demonstrate that this expanded measure enables rich insight into the cultural landscape globally at previously impossible resolution. We analyse the importance of national borders in shaping culture and compare subnational divisiveness with gender divisiveness across countries. Our measure enables detailed investigation into the geopolitical stability of countries, social cleavages within small- and large-scale human groups, the integration of migrant populations and the disaffection of certain population groups from the political process, among myriad other potential future applications.

<title>The Double Edge of Common Interest: Ethnic Segregation as an Unintended Byproduct of Opinion Homophily</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0038040711427314</url>
<snippet>How can we reduce ethnic friendship segregation in ethnically heterogeneous schools? The Common Ingroup Identity Model suggests that interethnic friendships are promoted by those intervention programs that focus on the interests students have in common. The authors argue that the outcome of these common interest interventions may crucially depend on sufficient consensus in participants' opinions regarding the shared interest. Such an intervention may backfire and increase ethnic segregation if participants from different ethnic groups have different opinions about the common interest. The authors test their argument analyzing the dynamics of friendship networks and opinions in 48 school classes with an actor-based stochastic model. Their findings suggest that salient common interests in ethnically mixed school classes can indeed reduce ethnic segregation. However, they also found that friendship selection on the basis of similar opinions can foster ethnic segregation. This occurred when ethnicity was correlated with the opinions that students held regarding the salient interest, even when these students did not prefer intra-ethnic friendship per se.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2023.2290152</url>
<snippet>Artisan entrepreneurship is an important way to develop economic prosperity in cultural industry, but there is a lack of systematic and quantitative review guidance. With 818 SSCI documents from the Web of Science database from 1992 to 2022, this paper uses bibliometric and visualization analysis methods to review and sort out the research in the field of artisan entrepreneurship, reveal the knowledge base and research hotspots, and put forward suggestions and outlook. The study finds that the knowledge bases of artisan entrepreneurship research include cultural entrepreneurship theory, resources-based theory, social network theory, family entrepreneurship theory and micro-theory of tourism industry development. The research hotspots focus on six themes: artisan entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial drivers, factors influencing the entrepreneurial process of artisans, economic value, cultural values, and social values. Finally, the existing theoretical framework of artisan entrepreneurship is integrated and future research directions and perspectives are proposed from six perspectives.

<title>EFFECTIVENESS OF OPINION INFLUENCE APPROACHES IN HIGHLY CLUSTERED ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219525914500088</url>
<snippet>A mathematical model was developed for opinion propagation on online social networks using a scale-free network with an adjustable clustering coefficient. Connected nodes influence each other when the difference between their opinion values is less than a threshold value. The model is used to examine effectiveness of three different approaches for influencing public opinion. The approaches examined include (1) a "Class", defined as an approach (such as a class or book) that greatly influences a small, randomly selected portion of the population, (2) an "Advertisement", defined as an approach (such as a TV or online advertisement) that has a small influence at each viewing on a large randomly selected portion of the population, and (3) an "App", defined as an approach (such as a Facebook game or smartphone "App") that spreads via the online social network (rather than randomly) and has a small influence at each viewing on the affected population. The Class and Advertisement approaches result in similar overall influence on the population, despite the fact that these approaches are highly different. In contrast, the App approach has a much more significant effect on opinion values of users occupying clusters within the social network compared to the overall population.

<title>Inequality Preservation through Uneven Diffusion of Cultural Materials across Stratified Groups</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/sou101</url>
<snippet>Inequality between groups is frequently maintained through the construction and legitimation of inter-group cultural differences. I draw on Blau's multiform heterogeneity and complex contagion models to theorize and develop a relational mechanism that shows how inequality can be preserved when additional, new bases of differentiating between groups layer over existing ones. I investigate the conditions under which variations in the distribution of the population across stratified groups and homophily of social networks along the stratifying attribute interact in such a way that a belief/practice diffuses widely in one group but not the other-an outcome referred to as differential diffusion. I also analyze how size of ego networks and adoption thresholds affect differential diffusion. Using mathematical and agent-based models, I find a positive correlation between adoption thresholds and homophily: when social networks are highly homophilous (e.g., race and socioeconomic class), uneven diffusion of non-normative behavior reproduces inequality; inclusive networks (e.g., in diverse city schools), in contrast, reestablish inequality through differential diffusion of low-risk behavior. This suggests that cultivating diversity is likely to mitigate inequality preservation in conservative situations where adoption of new beliefs/practices needs considerable affirmation. Encouraging status-based solidarity is more appropriate in receptive contexts where adoption of new behaviors entails comparatively lower risk. The results also imply that analyses of diffusion need to be sensitive to contextual factors, including homophily, cultural institutionalization of the diffusing material, and population distribution. Finally, I extend Ridgeway's seminal work to show how relational structure can not only construct status hierarchies but also contribute to their symbolic maintenance.

<title>Information Network Among Farmers: A Case Study in Ghana</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440241228696</url>
<snippet>It is well established that a person's productivity is strongly related to interactions among their network cycles. Despite this, much of the literature concerning farmers' productivity describes only their formal relationships with extension officials, ignoring their personal relationships. This study was motivated by the need to understand how farmers can use their social networks to promote information diffusion and learning among themselves. The study assessed whether farmers' information networks can positively influence their productivity and performance through the study of their network structure. We used survey data from 200 Ghanaian farmers. The data was then analyzed using descriptive statistics and an exponential random graph model (ERGM). The results of this study showed that farmers' information networks had a positive effect on their performance and productivity. The study also revealed that farmers seek information from key and influential farmers while key farmers also seek information from other key farmers. A further finding of the study showed that many factors contributed to the successful diffusion of information, such as popularity, activity spread, reciprocity, multiple connections, and homophily of experience. However, on the other hand, transitivity was not significant in this network. Hence, this study clarifies the effect of the structural characteristics of farmers' information network which influence information diffusion for higher performance and productivity. This study argues that agricultural managers should take measures to ensure that farmers understand how their information network can benefit their peers, as well as their own performance and productivity. Studies have shown that, personal interaction and networks has the ability to influence a person's productivity. But most of the existing literature concentrate much on the formal relationships with extension officials, ignoring personal relationships.

<title>Team talk: Learning, jargon, and structure versus the pulse of the network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.05.002</url>
<snippet>We began this work intending to illustrate the network origins of jargon, a signal feature of team learning and the division of labor. In the process, we came to recognize the substantive importance of message timing, which we discuss as the pulse of a network. This paper describes our route to that recognition. We analyze data from a renovated classic network experiment providing empirical support for three hypotheses. The first, and most familiar from past work, is that teams moving down their learning curve to greater efficiency are prone to shared jargon. As a team moves down its learning curve, language drifts away from day-to-day speech, into jargon. The second and third hypotheses concern network correlates of the drift. With respect to network structure, teams are less likely to converge on jargon when communication is concentrated in one teammate. With respect to pulse, teams are more likely to converge on jargon when communication efforts are numerous and crowded in time. The two network predictors overlap conceptually. They both involve learning and access to information, but are distinct in their mechanism: Structure provides access. Pulse creates motivation to access. Teammates keeping up with numerous messages concentrated in time have a shared incentive to find shorthand terms (i.e., jargon) that enable faster exchange of accurate information. Network structure predicts team convergence on jargon, but pulse is a stronger predictor. Directions for new research are discussed.

<title>Social network effects on academic achievement</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2017.06.001</url>
<snippet>How peer groups contribute to educational outcomes has long interested researchers. However, the possibility that peer groups dominated by either low- or high-achieving youth can have substantively different effects on achievement has been largely ignored. In this paper, we show that while being embedded in a high-achieving network of friends is not associated with increased own achievement, being embedded in a low-achieving network is associated with decreased own achievement. In additional analyses, we present evidence that these associations are at least in part due to influence, as opposed to only selection effects or shared environment. We also examine whether the structure of the network in which a student is embedded might affect their educational achievement. We show that achieving at higher levels positively predicts how centrally located a student is in their network, but being more centrally located does not predict concurrent achievement. This finding suggests that the behavior of individuals is affecting the formation of network structure and not the reverse. (C) 2017 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

<title>A Structural Econometric Analysis of Network Formation Games Through Subnetworks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA12558</url>
<snippet>The objective of this paper is to identify and estimate network formation models using observed data on network structure. We characterize network formation as a simultaneous-move game, where the utility from forming a link depends on the structure of the network, thereby generating strategic interactions between links. With the prevalence of multiple equilibria, the parameters are not necessarily point identified. We leave the equilibrium selection unrestricted and propose a partial identification approach. We derive bounds on the probability of observing a subnetwork, where a subnetwork is the restriction of a network to a subset of the individuals. Unlike the standard bounds as in Ciliberto and Tamer (2009), these subnetwork bounds are computationally tractable in large networks provided we consider small subnetworks. We provide Monte Carlo evidence that bounds from small subnetworks are informative in large networks.

<title>Positive algorithmic bias cannot stop fragmentation in homophilic networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2020.1818078</url>
<snippet>Fragmentation, echo chambers, and their amelioration in social networks have been a growing concern in the academic and non-academic world. This paper shows how, under the assumption of homophily, echo chambers and fragmentation are system-immanent phenomena of highly flexible social networks, even under ideal conditions for heterogeneity. We achieve this by finding an analytical, network-based solution to the Schelling model and by proving that weak ties do not hinder the process. Furthermore, we derive that no level of positive algorithmic bias in the form of rewiring is capable of preventing fragmentation and its effect on reducing the fragmentation speed is negligible.

<title>Determinants of user acceptance of a specific social platform for older adults: An empirical examination of user interface characteristics and behavioral intention</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180102</url>
<snippet>The use of the Internet and social applications has many benefits for the elderly, but numerous investigations have shown that the elderly do not perceive online social networks as a friendly social environment. Therefore, TreeIt, a social application specifically designed for the elderly, was developed for this study. In the TreeIt application, seven mechanisms promoting social interaction were designed to allow older adults to use social networking sites (SNSs) to increase social connection, maintain the intensity of social connections and strengthen social experience. This study's main objective was to investigate how user interface design affects older people's intention and attitude related to using SNSs. Fourteen user interface evaluation heuristics proposed by Zhang et al. were adopted as the criteria to assess user interface usability and further grouped into three categories: system support, user interface design and navigation. The technology acceptance model was adopted to assess older people's intention and attitude related to using SNSs. One hundred and one elderly persons were enrolled in this study as subjects, and the results showed that all of the hypotheses proposed in this study were valid: system support and perceived usefulness had a significant effect on behavioral intention; user interface design and perceived ease of use were positively correlated with perceived usefulness; and navigation exerted an influence on perceived ease of use. The results of this study are valuable for the future development of social applications for the elderly.

<title>Categories and networks in jazz evolution: The overlap between bandleaders' jazz sidemen from 1930 to 1969</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2015.04.001</url>
<snippet>This paper expands on Peterson's process model for historical changes in jazz. Peterson suggests that, given certain circumstances, musical genres migrate from 'low-brow' to 'high-brow'. I test this proposition for jazz by investigating whether bandleaders were associated through the same sidemen ('sidemen overlap') across time, and the underlying logics leading to these overlaps. I confirm Peterson's model to the extent that sidemen overlap shifts from a 'commercial' logic to a 'style-based' logic. From 1930 to 1949, sidemen overlap between bandleaders is mainly predicted by recording session volumes (akin to 'commercial logic'). From 1945 to 1969, style similarity emerges as an important predictor of sidemen overlap. I extend Peterson's process model by providing a more nuanced account, based on social networks. I show substantive collaboration across styles. As a consequence, stylistic shifts are not as abrupt as originally depicted. I also explore how past associations become increasingly stronger in terms of explaining sidemen overlap. Furthermore, race emerges as an important variable in explaining the same phenomenon. During the thirties, non-African-American homophily is high. After this period, African-American homophily increases steadily until the late fifties, decreasing again during the sixties.

<title>EXTRACTING REAL SOCIAL INTERACTIONS FROM A DEBATE OF COVID-19 POLICIES ON TWITTER: THE CASE OF MEXICO</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S021952592150017X</url>
<snippet>Twitter is a popular social medium for sharing opinions and engaging in topical debates, yet presents a wide spread of misinformation, especially in political debates, from bots and adversarial attacks. The current state-of-the-art methods for detecting humans and bots in Twitter often lack generalizability beyond English. Here, a language-agnostic method to detect real users and their interactions by leveraging network topology from retweets is presented. To that end, the chosen topic is COVID-19 policies in Mexico, which has been considered by users as polemic. Two kinds of network are built: a directed network of retweets; and the co-event network, where a non-directed link between two users exists if they have retweeted the same post in a given time window (projection of a bipartite network). Then, single node properties of these networks, such as the clustering coefficient and the degree, are studied. Three kinds of users are observed: some with a high clustering coefficient but a very small degree, a second group with zero clustering coefficient and a variable degree, and a third group in which the clustering coefficient as a function of the degree decays as a power law. This third group represents similar to 2&#37; of the users and is characteristic of dynamical networks with feedback. The latter seems to represent strongly interacting followers/followed in a real social network as confirmed by an inspection of such nodes. A percolation analysis of the resulting co-retweet and co-hashtag network reveals the relevance of such weak links, typical of real social human networks. The presented methods are simple to implement in other social media platforms and can be used to mitigate misinformation and conflicts.

<title>Life-spheres, networks, and sustained participation in social movements: A phenomenological approach to political commitment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007550321469</url>
<snippet>This article proposes an account of individual participation in social movements that combines structural and cultural factors. It aims to explain why certain activists continue to be involved in social movements while others withdraw. When activists remain embedded in social networks relevant for the protest issues and, above all, when they keep a symbolic linkage between their activism and their personal life-spheres, sustained participation is likely to occur. When these two factors become progressively separated from each other and the process of self-interaction by activists loses its strength, disengagement can be expected. The argument is illustrated with life-history interviews of activists who have kept their strong commitment to a major organization of the Swiss solidarity movement, and others that, in contrast, have abandoned their involvement. The findings support the argument that the interplay of the structural positions of actors and the symbolic meanings of mobilization has a strong impact on commitment to social movements and hence on sustained participation or disengagement. In particular, the interviews show the importance of a sense of coherence and of a holistic view of one's personal life for keeping commitment over time. This calls for a view of individual participation in social movements that draws from social phenomenology and symbolic interactionism in order to shed light on the symbolic (subjective) dimensions of participation.

<title>Universal association between depressive symptoms and social-network structures in the workplace</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14366-9</url>
<snippet>An unhealthy communication structure at a workplace can adversely affect the mental health of employees. However, little is known about the relationship between communication structures in the workplace and the mental health of employees. Here, we evaluated the face-to-face interaction network among employees (N = 449) in a variety of real-world working environments by using wearable devices and investigated the relationship between social network characteristics and depressive symptoms. We found that the cohesive interaction structure surrounding each individual was negatively correlated with depressive symptoms: a universal relationship regardless of occupation type. This correlation was evident at the group scale and was strongly related to active interactions with abundant body movement. Our findings provide a quantitative and collective perspective on taking a systematic approach to workplace depression, and they suggest that the mental health of employees needs to be addressed systematically, not only individually.

<title>The ambivalence of cultural homophily: Field positions, semantic similarities, and social network ties in creative collectives</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2019.02.004</url>
<snippet>This paper utilizes a mixture of qualitative, formal, and statistical socio-semantic network analyses to examine how cultural homophily works when field logic meets practice. On the one hand, because individuals in similar field positions are also imposed with similar cultural orientations, cultural homophily reproduces 'objective' field structure in intersubjective social network ties. On the other hand, fields are operative in practice and to accomplish pragmatic goals individuals who occupy different field positions often join in groups, creatively reinterpret the field-imposed cultural orientations, and produce cultural similarities alternative to the position-specific ones. Drawing on these emergent similarities, the cultural homophily mechanism might stimulate social network ties between members who occupy not the same but different field positions, thus contesting fields. I examine this ambivalent role of cultural homophily in two creative collectives, each embracing members positioned closer to the opposite poles of the field of cultural production. I find different types of cultural similarities to affect different types of social network ties within and between the field positions: Similarity of vocabularies stimulates friendship and collaboration ties within positions, thus reproducing the field, while affiliation with the same cultural structures stimulates collaboration ties between positions, thus contesting the field. The latter effect is visible under statistical analysis of ethnographic data, but easy to oversee in qualitative analysis of texts because informants tend to flag conformity to their positions in their explicit statements. This highlights the importance of mixed socio-semantic network analysis, both sensitive to the local context and capable of unveiling the mechanisms underlying the interplay between the cultural and the social.

<title>Group threat, political extremity, and collective dynamics in online discussions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-28569-1</url>
<snippet>Collectives adapt their network structure to the challenges they face. It has been hypothesized that collectives experiencing a real or imagined threat from an outgroup tend to consolidate behind a few group members, and that network structures in which a few members attract most of the attention are more likely in politically extreme groups. These hypotheses have not been tested in large-scale real-world settings. We reconstruct networks of tens of thousands of commenters participating in comment sections of high-profile U.S. political news websites spanning the political spectrum from left to right, including Mother Jones, The Atlantic, The Hill, and Breitbart. We investigate the relationship between different indices of inequality of attention in commenters' networks and perceived group threat associated with significant societal events, from elections and political rallies to mass shootings. Our findings support the hypotheses that groups facing a real or imagined outgroup threat and groups that are more politically extreme are more likely to attend to a few high-profile members. These results provide an extensive real-world test of theoretical accounts of collective adaptation to outgroup threats.

<title>A natural experiment of social network formation and dynamics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1404770112</url>
<snippet>Social networks affect many aspects of life, including the spread of diseases, the diffusion of information, the workers' productivity, and consumers' behavior. Little is known, however, about how these networks form and change. Estimating causal effects and mechanisms that drive social network formation and dynamics is challenging because of the complexity of engineering social relations in a controlled environment, endogeneity between network structure and individual characteristics, and the lack of time-resolved data about individuals' behavior. We leverage data from a sample of 1.5 million college students on Facebook, who wrote more than 630 million messages and 590 million posts over 4 years, to design a long-term natural experiment of friendship formation and social dynamics in the aftermath of a natural disaster. The analysis shows that affected individuals are more likely to strengthen interactions, while maintaining the same number of friends as unaffected individuals. Our findings suggest that the formation of social relationships may serve as a coping mechanism to deal with high-stress situations and build resilience in communities.

<title>The Dynamics of Public Opinion in Complex Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>This paper studies the problem of public opinion formation and concentrates on the interplays among three factors: individual attributes, environmental influences and information flow. We present a simple model to analyze the dynamics of four types of networks. Our simulations suggest that regular communities establish not only local consensus, but also global diversity in public opinions. However, when small world networks, random networks, or scale-free networks model social relationships, the results are sensitive to the elasticity coefficient of environmental influences and the average connectivity of the type of network. For example, a community with a higher average connectivity has a higher probability of consensus. Yet, it is misleading to predict results merely based on the characteristic path length of networks. In the process of changing environmental influences and average connectivity, sensitive areas are discovered in the system. By sensitive areas we mean that interior randomness emerges and we cannot predict unequivocally how many opinions will remain upon reaching equilibrium. We also investigate the role of authoritative individuals in information control. While enhancing average connectivity facilitates the diffusion of the authoritative opinion, it makes individuals subject to disturbance from non-authorities as well. Thus, a moderate average connectivity may be preferable because then the public will most likely form an opinion that is parallel with the authoritative one. In a community with a scale-free structure, the influence of authoritative individuals keeps constant with the change of the average connectivity. Provided that the influence of individuals is proportional to the number of their acquaintances, the smallest percentage of authorities is required for a controlled consensus in a scale free network. This study shows that the dynamics of public opinion varies from community to community due to the different degree of impressionability of people and the distinct social network structure of the community.

<title>Networks and Complexity: Directions for Interactionist Research?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/si.2010.33.3.341</url>
<snippet>In this article I consider the potential importance of social networks for symbolic interactionism. Specifically, I argue that symbolic interactionism operates with an underdeveloped and often tacit conception of networks; that network analysis offers us various tools for further developing and operationalizing this conception, empirically; and that doing so would be to our considerable advantage. In addition, I argue that a stronger focus on networks would give interactionism an inroad into important contemporary debates on "complexity," building on an obvious but again underdeveloped affinity between these two academic domains. Moreover, tackling complexity raises important and central sociological concerns of structure/agency and micro/macro, with the additional payoff that interactionism can develop and demonstrate its strengths, as an approach, in addressing the problems often associated with these concerns.

<title>Evolution of innovation networks in industrial clusters and multidimensional proximity: A case of Chinese cultural clusters</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10805</url>
<snippet>The innovation and optimization of cultural industry clusters is important to the promotion of economic structural transformation and high-quality development. Taking 31 provinces (municipalities directly under the Central Government and autonomous regions in China) as the research object, the cross-sectional data included the number of joint patent applications for culture and related industries among provinces (regions) in 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020. Then, the cluster innovation network was constructed using social network analysis (SNA) based on scientific identification of cultural industry clusters. This new cluster innovation network structure and its spatial evolution characteristics are accessible with the help of UCINet and ArcGIS tools. Finally, the multiple regression-quadratic assignment procedure (MR-QAP) method is used to determine the influence of geographical proximity, technological proximity, and social proximity on the evolution pattern of the cultural industry cluster innovation network. The results of the study are important for improving the efficiency of national cultural industry innovation and promoting regional synergistic development.

<title>Social Content Recommendation Based on Spatial-Temporal Aware Diffusion Modeling in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym8090089</url>
<snippet>User interactions in online social networks (OSNs) enable the spread of information and enhance the information dissemination process, but at the same time they exacerbate the information overload problem. In this paper, we propose a social content recommendation method based on spatial-temporal aware controlled information diffusion modeling in OSNs. Users interact more frequently when they are close to each other geographically, have similar behaviors, and fall into similar demographic categories. Considering these facts, we propose multicriteria-based social ties relationship and temporal-aware probabilistic information diffusion modeling for controlled information spread maximization in OSNs. The proposed social ties relationship modeling takes into account user spatial information, content trust, opinion similarity, and demographics. We suggest a ranking algorithm that considers the user ties strength with friends and friends-of-friends to rank users in OSNs and select highly influential injection nodes. These nodes are able to improve social content recommendations, minimize information diffusion time, and maximize information spread. Furthermore, the proposed temporal-aware probabilistic diffusion process categorizes the nodes and diffuses the recommended content to only those users who are highly influential and can enhance information dissemination. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

<title>Delinquent peers revisited: Does network structure matter?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/320298</url>
<snippet>This study examines whether structural properties of friendship networks condition the association between friends' delinquency and an individual's own delinquent behavior. Data from the Add Health allows a more accurate conceptualization of the peer network and a more rigorous measurement of peer delinquency than previous research. Findings from this study indicate that friends' delinquency is associated with an adolescent's own delinquency involvement. However, characteristics of adolescents' friendship networks, such as its density and adolescents' centrality and popularity, condition the delinquency-peer association. Network density, in particular, emerges as an important component of the delinquency-peer association, with very cohesive networks containing stronger delinquency-peer associations than those that are less cohesive. These findings suggest that it is necessary to consider the underlying structural properties of friendship networks in order to understand the impact of peer influence on adolescent delinquency.

<title>Gender inequalities in research funding: Unequal network configurations, or unequal network returns?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.12.007</url>
<snippet>Despite longstanding discussions and consequent improvements of gender representation in academia, the number of women working in academic research, their performance and their recognition still indicate the persistence of gender inequalities. Of the various mechanisms that may drive such inequality the one that relates the structure of research collaborative networks to the rewards that these networks facilitate is intriguing. If social networks play a role in academic performances and women are under-recognized compared to men, what are the mechanisms that relate networks to gender inequalities in academia? Do men and women obtain equal returns from similar network structure, or do women have to build different networks to obtain similar returns? This article contributes to the theoretical debate that aims to disentangle the mechanisms by which social networks may affect gendered success. We do so by looking at networks of collaborations to research projects in 10 years of public funding in Italy. We use a permutation t-test analysis to see if men and women, who are equally successful in getting funded for a high number of projects, build equal or unequal collaborative networks, and if these differences vary across disciplines with more or less tenured women. Our methodological contribution proposes an innovative way of measuring brokerage and constraint in one mode projections of bipartite networks, highly clustered and valued, and measures gender homophily by taking into account the higher or lower number of women available for collaborations in different disciplinary sectors. We find that men and women build similar collaborative networks; we also find that the more women are tenured in a discipline, the more they occupy higher ranks and lead research projects. When women's presence and high-rank roles increase, we see that men's collaborative networks are significantly more heterophilous, although women do not seem to significantly increase their collaborations with other women. We then regress the individual measures of network structure and composition against the average amount of money scholars receive per project and we interact each measure with gender, to observe if women obtain similar returns to men by building equal collaborative networks. Our results show that despite the similarities in network configurations in nearly all disciplines women still receive less funding than men. This suggests that an increased representation of women in academic fields is not enough to reduce inequalities. Our results are not directly generalizable to other international contexts, but the mechanisms that favor academic returns and exacerbate inequalities, and our methodological approach, are portable to other scientific and organizational contexts where collaborations are key to produce success.

<title>The structure of online social networks mirrors those in the offline world</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2015.04.005</url>
<snippet>We use data on frequencies of bi-directional posts to define edges (or relationships) in two Facebook datasets and a Twitter dataset and use these to create ego-centric social networks. We explore the internal structure of these networks to determine whether they have the same kind of layered structure as has been found in offline face-to-face networks (which have a distinctively scaled structure with successively inclusive layers at 5, 15,50 and 150 alters). The two Facebook datasets are best described by a four-layer structure and the Twitter dataset by a five-layer structure. The absolute sizes of these layers and the mean frequencies of contact with alters within each layer match very closely the observed values from offline networks. In addition, all three datasets reveal the existence of an innermost network layer at similar to 1.5 alters. Our analyses thus confirm the existence of the layered structure of ego-centric social networks with a very much larger sample (in total, &gt;185,000 egos) than those previously used to describe them, as well as identifying the existence of an additional network layer whose existence was only hypothesised in offline social networks. In addition, our analyses indicate that online communities have very similar structural characteristics to offline face-to-face networks. Published by Elsevier B.V.

<title>Design and Analysis of Experiments in Networks: Reducing Bias from Interference</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jci-2015-0021</url>
<snippet>Estimating the effects of interventions in networks is complicated due to interference, such that the outcomes for one experimental unit may depend on the treatment assignments of other units. Familiar statistical formalism, experimental designs, and analysis methods assume the absence of this interference, and result in biased estimates of causal effects when it exists. While some assumptions can lead to unbiased estimates, these assumptions are generally unrealistic in the context of a network and often amount to assuming away the interference. In this work, we evaluate methods for designing and analyzing randomized experiments under minimal, realistic assumptions compatible with broad interference, where the aim is to reduce bias and possibly overall error in estimates of average effects of a global treatment. In design, we consider the ability to perform random assignment to treatments that is correlated in the network, such as through graph cluster randomization. In analysis, we consider incorporating information about the treatment assignment of network neighbors. We prove sufficient conditions for bias reduction through both design and analysis in the presence of potentially global interference; these conditions also give lower bounds on treatment effects. Through simulations of the entire process of experimentation in networks, we measure the performance of these methods under varied network structure and varied social behaviors, finding substantial bias reductions and, despite a bias-variance tradeoff, error reductions. These improvements are largest for networks with more clustering and data generating processes with both stronger direct effects of the treatment and stronger interactions between units.

<title>Peers and Sources as Social Capital in the Production of News: Online Social Networks as Communities of Journalists</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439314539128</url>
<snippet>In a very short time span, Twitter has become a major force in modern societies and also in the production of news by journalists. How journalists use Twitter is studied extensively, particularly on a small scale (i.e., qualitative research, specific events, mostly descriptive). However, studies on how Twitter has impacted journalism as a whole are relatively scarce. This study focuses on the adoption of Twitter and its emerging community network structure in the Netherlands. Using the social network data of 2,152 journalists as retrieved from Twitter, analysis shows that the social network among journalists is well connected. The journalists who are extremely popular are also able to influence the flow of information through the network more than others (cf. gatekeeper role). Still, even though gatekeeping positions in the network are present due to the absence of specific relations, and the network consists of eight tightly knit network communities, the entire network is very well connected. The adoption of Twitter as a microblogging and networking service over time indicated that adoption increased particularly in early 2009. The possible consequences of these tightly knit communities for the production of news are discussed in terms of pack journalism, echo chambers, and information cascades.

<title>A scoping review on the current and potential use of social network analysis for evaluation purposes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1356389018782219</url>
<snippet>The pervasiveness and importance of relationships and networks has fueled the development of the social network analysis approach, which considers structural relationships to be primary causes of societal outcomes. While the potential of social network analysis has been demonstrated and discussed extensively in social science research, relatively little is known about the current and potential use of social network analysis for evaluation purposes. This scoping review of journal articles reveals that evaluators use social network analysis because of its ability to identify key stakeholders, assess network structures and relationships quantitatively, reveal informal relations and visualize even complex networks. However, challenges arise when interpreting findings, determining causation between network structures and outcomes and disseminating evaluation results in an ethically responsible manner. The review concludes that the evaluation field?especially in the development sector?would benefit greatly from increased use of social network analysis, but that this would first require improved use of alternative sources of network data, qualitative methods and inferential statistics that will enable evaluators to move beyond descriptive network analysis.

<title>SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL NETWORKS TO IDENTIFY PERIODICITY</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2011.556767</url>
<snippet>Two key problems in the study of longitudinal networks are determining when to chunk continuous time data into discrete time periods for network analysis and identifying periodicity in the data. In addition, statistical process control applied to longitudinal social network measures can be biased by the effects of relational dependence and periodicity in the data. Thus, the detection of change is often obscured by random noise. Fourier analysis is used to determine statistically significant periodic frequencies in longitudinal network data. Two approaches are then offered: using significant periods as a basis to chunk data for longitudinal network analysis or using the significant periods to filter the longitudinal data. E-mail communication collected at the United States Military Academy is examined.

<title>A new model for information diffusion in heterogeneous social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/0081-1750.00067</url>
<snippet>This paper discusses a new model for the diffusion of information through heterogeneous social networks. In earlier models, when information was given by one actor to another the transmitter did not retain the information. The new model is an improvement on earlier ones because it allows a transmitter of information to retain that information after telling it to somebody else. Consequently, the new model allows more actors to have information during the information diffusion process. The model provides predictions of diffusion times in a given network at the global, dyadic, and individual levels. This leads to straight forward generalizations of network measures, such as closeness centrality and betweenness centrality, for research problems that focus on the efficiency of information transfer in a network. We analyze in detail how information diffusion rimes and centrality measures depend an a series of network measures, such as degrees and bridges. One important finding is that predictions about the time actors need to spread information in the network differ considerably between the new and old models, while the predictions about the time needed to I receive information hardly differ. Finally, some cautionary remarks are made about using the model in empirical research.

<title>Social capital exchanges in voluntary associations and work organizations: A network perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/soc4.13031</url>
<snippet>Organizations have been an important setting in which social capital exchanges (SCEs) occur, but little work has been done to distinguish two predominant species of organizations in the social network literature: voluntary associations and formal work organizations. Addressing this lacuna, this article comparatively examines how the two organizational species differ in (1) how two prominent types of SCEs operate (restricted and generalized exchange), as well as (2) the analytical approaches and methodological tools for studying SCEs (boundary-specification, sampling, network designs, tie-recording methods) and their adherent implications for network structure (networking conditions and homophily). This article concludes by identifying methodological and theoretical challenges for studying SCEs in organizations (conceptualizing organizations as units, underappreciating meaning-making and methodological triangulation, and examining contagion in organizational networks in an age of digitalization) and developing recommendations for overcoming them.

<title>A co-innovation network in Northeast China oriented to high-quality development</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2021.1991573</url>
<snippet>Innovation is the primary driving force and important support for Northeast China's revitalisation strategy to move toward 'high-quality development'. Based on 1985-2016 data, this study aimed to explore structural characteristics and organisational patterns of a co-innovation network from a high-quality development perspective based on social network analysis. Previous literature on the co-innovation network only emphasise network scale expansion and network density increases, ignoring the optimisation of network structure. The evolutionary analysis showed that the co-innovation network in Northeast China presents high growth, openness, hierarchy, assortativity, accessibility and clustering. Regarding organisational patterns, the network's top-level structure was reconstructed, developing from 'dual-core drive' to 'multi-core resonance', forming a 'multi core and semi core and peripheral city' structure. To improve the high-quality network development, it is necessary to strengthen the radiation-driving ability of core cities, clarify the function orientation of non-core cities, eliminate administrative barriers and guide the professional and differentiated development of non-core cities.

<title>Do terrorists make a difference in criminal networks? An empirical analysis on illicit drug and narco-terror networks in their prioritization between security and efficiency</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.11.001</url>
<snippet>By using Social Network Analysis (SNA), this study empirically analyzes five PKK Affiliated narco-terror and five illicit drug networks in the Turkish context to identify and compare their approach to the security-efficiency tradeoff. Results revealed that although terrorist members are in key roles and powerful positions (central and intermediary), average scores of cohesion and centrality of narco-terror networks seem to be only slightly more security driven than those of illicit drug networks. However, analyses of individual networks from both types yield no clear structural distinction in prioritizing between security and efficiency. This study, in general, finds that networks from both camps are structurally more efficiency driven. They are denser with more direct ties; generally clustered into sub-groups attached to networks' cores and peripheries; they reflect coreness, where key players act in pivotal positions with high power, centrality, and brokerage to efficiently control and coordinate network activities. This is then found to cause security vulnerabilities of greater visibility (susceptibility of disruption) and high dependence on central actors constituting structural holes (possible elimination of entire network when compromised). However, sample networks strive to balance the security by keeping the paths-for the flow of information-shorter and being clustered into denser sub-groups with strong pre-existing trust-ties (kinship and friendship) which reduces the risk of detection and infiltration. This study argues that the nature of objective dominates the structural characteristics regarding the security-efficiency dilemma, and thus, both illicit drug and PKK affiliated narco-terror networks in Turkish context are driven by material incentives relying more on efficiency and striving to balance organizational security with social characteristics (trust ties).

<title>Social network architecture and the maintenance of deleterious cultural traits</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2011.0555</url>
<snippet>How have changes in communications technology affected the way that misinformation spreads through a population and persists? To what extent do differences in the architecture of social networks affect the spread of misinformation, relative to the rates and rules by which individuals transmit or eliminate different pieces of information (cultural traits)? Here, we use analytical models and individual-based simulations to study how a 'cultural load' of misinformation can be maintained in a population under a balance between social transmission and selective elimination of cultural traits with low intrinsic value. While considerable research has explored how network architecture affects percolation processes, we find that the relative rates at which individuals transmit or eliminate traits can have much more profound impacts on the cultural load than differences in network architecture. In particular, the cultural load is insensitive to correlations between an individual's network degree and rate of elimination when these quantities vary among individuals. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in communications technology may have influenced cultural evolution more strongly through changes in the amount of information flow, rather than the details of who is connected to whom.

<title>Social context and network formation: An experimental study</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2008.10.001</url>
<snippet>Recently, there has been increasing interest in determining which social network structures emerge as a consequence of the conscious actions of actors. Motivated by the belief that "networks matter" in reaching personal objectives, it is a natural assumption that actors try to optimize their network position. Starting from the notion that an optimal network position depends on the social context, we examine how actors change their networks to reach better positions in various contexts. Distinguishing between three social contexts (a neutral context, a context in which closed triads are costly, and a context in which closed triads are beneficial), theoretical results predict that emerging networks are contingent on the incentives that are present in these contexts. Experiments are used to test whether networks that are theoretically predicted to be stable are also stable experimentally. We find that emerging networks correspond to a large extent with the predicted networks. Consequently, they are contingent on the incentives present in various social contexts. In addition, we find that subjects tend to form specific stable networks with a higher probability than predicted, namely, efficient networks and networks in which everyone is equally well off.

<title>Sensitivity Analysis of an Individual-Based Model for Simulation of Influenza Epidemics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0045414</url>
<snippet>Individual-based epidemiology models are increasingly used in the study of influenza epidemics. Several studies on influenza dynamics and evaluation of intervention measures have used the same incubation and infectious period distribution parameters based on the natural history of influenza. A sensitivity analysis evaluating the influence of slight changes to these parameters (in addition to the transmissibility) would be useful for future studies and real-time modeling during an influenza pandemic. In this study, we examined individual and joint effects of parameters and ranked parameters based on their influence on the dynamics of simulated epidemics. We also compared the sensitivity of the model across synthetic social networks for Montgomery County in Virginia and New York City (and surrounding metropolitan regions) with demographic and rural-urban differences. In addition, we studied the effects of changing the mean infectious period on age-specific epidemics. The research was performed from a public health standpoint using three relevant measures: time to peak, peak infected proportion and total attack rate. We also used statistical methods in the design and analysis of the experiments. The results showed that: (i) minute changes in the transmissibility and mean infectious period significantly influenced the attack rate; (ii) the mean of the incubation period distribution appeared to be sufficient for determining its effects on the dynamics of epidemics; (iii) the infectious period distribution had the strongest influence on the structure of the epidemic curves; (iv) the sensitivity of the individual-based model was consistent across social networks investigated in this study and (v) age-specific epidemics were sensitive to changes in the mean infectious period irrespective of the susceptibility of the other age groups. These findings suggest that small changes in some of the disease model parameters can significantly influence the uncertainty observed in real-time forecasting and predicting of the characteristics of an epidemic.

<title>Multidisciplinary learning through collective performance favors decentralization</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2303568120</url>
<snippet>Many models of learning in teams assume that team members can share solutions or learn concurrently. However, these assumptions break down in multidisciplinary teams where team members often complete distinct, interrelated pieces of larger tasks. Such contexts make it difficult for individuals to separate the performance effects of their own actions from the actions of interacting neighbors. In this work, we show that individuals can overcome this challenge by learning from network neighbors through mediating artifacts (like collective performance assessments). When neighbors' actions influence collective outcomes, teams with different networks perform relatively similarly to one another. However, varying a team's network can affect performance on tasks that weight individuals' contributions by network properties. Consequently, when individuals innovate (through "exploring" searches), dense networks hurt performance slightly by increasing uncertainty. In contrast, dense networks moderately help performance when individuals refine their work (through "exploiting" searches) by efficiently finding local optima. We also find that decentralization improves team performance across a battery of 34 tasks. Our results offer design principles for multidisciplinary teams within which other forms of learning prove more difficult.

<title>The influence of network structures of Wikipedia discussion pages on the efficiency of WikiProjects</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2015.04.002</url>
<snippet>As a platform for discussion and communication, talk pages play an essential role in Wikipedia to facilitate coordination, sharing of information and knowledge resources among Wikipedians. In this work we explore the influence of network structures of these pages on the efficiency of WikiProjects. Project efficiency is measured as the amount of work done by project members in a quarter. The study uses the comments on WikiProject talk pages to construct communication networks. The structural properties of these networks are studied using ideas from social network theory. We develop three hypotheses about how network structures influence project effectiveness and examine the hypotheses using a longitudinal dataset of 362 WikiProjects. The evaluation suggests that an intermediate level of cohesion with a core of influential users dominating network flow improves effectiveness for a WikiProject, and that greater average membership tenure relates to project efficiency in a positive way. We discuss the implications of this analysis for the future management of WikiProjects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>The role of network setting and gender in online content popularity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1252411</url>
<snippet>In this study, we explore the role of specific network structures that enhance social capital and assess the extent to which gender, social ties, and communication interaction relate to content popularity within online social networks (OSNs). Our results are based on an extensive OSN data set, containing over 100,000 members, connected by over 1.7 million links. The findings indicate that content popularity inference is more accurate when considering activity interaction among users and that network structures known as advantageous for amassing social capital in the offline environment are relevant online as well. We conclude by discussing how gender mediates the correlation between some network measures and the growth of users' content popularity and provide a potential explanation for the emergence of gender differences.

<title>Who Says What in Which Networks: What influences Social Media Users' Emotional Reactions to the COVID-19 Vaccine Infodemic?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393221128940</url>
<snippet>This study aims to identify effective predictors that influence publics' emotional reactions to COVID-19 vaccine misinformation as well as corrective messages. We collected a large sample of COVID-19 vaccine related misinformation and corrective messages on Facebook as well as the users' emotional reactions (i.e., emojis) to these messages. Focusing on three clusters of features such as messages' linguistic features, source characteristics, and messages' network positions, we examined whether users' reactions to misinformation and corrective information would differ. We used random forest models to identify the most salient predictors among over 70 predictors for both types of messages. Our analysis found that for misinformation, political ideology of the message source was the most salient feature that predicted anxious and enthusiastic reactions, followed by message features that highlight personal concerns and messages' network positions. For corrective messages, while the sources' ideology was still key to raising anxiety, the most important feature for triggering enthusiasm was the messages' network positions and message quality.

<title>Network Structure, Perception Level, and Participants' Welfares</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cplx.21570</url>
<snippet>Based on a market consisting of one monopoly and several customers who are embedded in an economic network, we study how the different perception levels about the network structure affect the two kinds of participants' welfares, and then provide some good strategies for the monopoly to mine the information of the network structure. The above question is the embodiment of the "complex structure and its corresponding functions'' question often mentioned in the field of complexity science. We apply a two-stage game to solve for the optimal pricing and consumption at different perception levels of the monopoly and further utilize simulation analysis to explore the influence patterns. We also discuss how this theoretic model can be applied to a real world problem by introducing the statistical exponential random graph model and its estimation method. Further, the main findings have specific policy implications on uncovering network information and demonstrate that it is possible for the policy-maker to design some win-win mechanisms for uplifting both the monopoly's profit and the whole customers' welfare at the same time.

<title>Advertising to a social network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11129-010-9093-9</url>
<snippet>Direct advertising-sending promotional messages to individual customers-is increasingly used by marketers as a result of the recent improvements in consumer reachability. Most current methods to calculate optimal budgets for such advertising campaigns consider customers in isolation and ignore word-of-mouth communication (WOM). When the customer base forms a network (as is the case in telecom or social network databases) ignoring WOM clearly leads to suboptimal advertising budgets. This paper develops a model to help address this challenge. We assume that firms know the network structure formed by customers but do not know (or are not allowed to use) data on individuals' connections. Under this scenario, we compare the optimal campaign of a monopolist to that of firms competing in simultaneous-move or sequential-move games. The analysis provides two key insights: (i) we show that ignoring the existence of WOM leads to significant profit loss for firms and this is more so under competition. In particular, knowing the "density" of consumer connections is crucial for the design of optimal campaigns. (ii) Competition in direct advertising exhibits strong first-mover advantages and, even in a simultaneous-move game between identical firms, highly asymmetric outcomes are possible. The paper also explores two extensions. First, we study the nature of the trade-off between increasing network size versus increasing the connectivity between existing network members. Second, we investigate how firms' advertising activity may endogenously grow the membership base.

<title>Structure matters: Assessing the statistical significance of network topologies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0309005</url>
<snippet>Network analysis has found widespread utility in many research areas. However, assessing the statistical significance of observed relationships within networks remains a complex challenge. Traditional node permutation tests are often insufficient in capturing the effect of changing network topology by creating reliable null distributions. We propose two randomization alternatives to address this gap: random rewiring and controlled rewiring. These methods incorporate changes in the network topology through edge swaps. However, controlled rewiring allows for more nuanced alterations of the original network than random rewiring. In this sense, this paper introduces a novel evaluation tool, the Expanded Quadratic Assignment Procedure (EQAP), designed to calculate a specific p-value and interpret statistical tests with enhanced precision. The combination of EQAP and controlled rewiring provides a robust network comparison and statistical analysis framework. The methodology is exemplified through two real-world examples: the analysis of an organizational network structure, illustrated by the Enron-Email dataset, and a social network case, represented by the UK Faculty friendship network. The utility of these statistical tests is underscored by their capacity to safeguard researchers against Type I errors when exploring network metrics dependent on intricate topologies.

<title>Ego centered social network and relationship quality: linking attachment security and relational models to network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.07.002</url>
<snippet>According to Dunbar's social brain hypothesis, brain capacity puts a limit on the size of social network in humans. At the same time, emotional-cognitive systems such as attachment and different relational models (Fiske, 1991) may also act as driving forces behind network structure underlying relationship quality of the various ego-centered layers. The aim of our study was to examine how these cognitive systems may contribute to network organization. We examined the two inner layers of the ego-network in 274 volunteers, the support and sympathy groups, as well as close family members in comparison to friends within the support group, in terms of attachment security and underlying relational models.

<title>Forecasting Changes in Religiosity and Existential Security with an Agent-based Model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3596</url>
<snippet>We employ existing data sets and agent-based modeling to forecast changes in religiosity and existential security among a collective of individuals overtime. Existential security reflects the extent of economic, socioeconomic and human development provided by society. Our model includes agents in social networks interacting with one another based on the education level of the agents, the religious practices of the agents, and each agent's existential security within their natural and social environments. The data used to inform the values and relationships among these variables is based on rigorous statistical analysis of the International Social Survey Programme Religion Module (ISSP) and the Human Development Report (HDR). We conduct an evaluation that demonstrates, for the countries and time periods studied, that our model provides a more accurate forecast of changes in existential security and religiosity than two alternative approaches. The improved accuracy is largely due to the inclusion of social networks with educational homophily which alters the way in which religiosity and existential security change in the model. These dynamics grow societies where two individuals with the same initial religious practices (or belief In God, or supernatural beliefs) evolve differently based on the educational backgrounds of the individuals with which they surround themselves. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our model and provide direction for future work.

<title>A new methodology to measure faultlines at scale leveraging digital traces</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00350-w</url>
<snippet>The definition of society is tight with human group-level behavior. Group faultlines defined as hypothetical lines splitting groups into homogeneous subgroups based on members' attributes have been proposed as a theoretical method to identify conflicts within groups. For instance, crusades and women's rights protests are the consequences of strong faultlines in societies with diverse cultures. Measuring the presence and strength of faultlines represents an important challenge. Existing literature resorts in questionnaires as traditional tool to find group-level behavioral attributes and thus identify faultlines. However, questionnaire data usually come with limitations and biases, especially for large-scale human group-level research. On top of that, questionnaires limit faultline research due to the possibility of dishonest answers, unconscientious responses, and differences in understanding and interpretation. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for measuring faultlines in large-scale groups, which leverages data readily available from online social networks' marketing platforms. Our methodology overcomes the limitations of traditional methods to measure group-level attributes and group faultlines at scale. To prove the applicability of our methodology, we analyzed the faultlines between people living in Spain, grouped by geographical regions. We collected data on 67,270 interest topics from Facebook users living in Spain, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. We computed existing metrics to measure faultlines' distance and strenght using our data to identify potential faultlines existing among Spanish regions. The results reveal that the strongest faultlines in Spain belong to Spanish Islands (the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands), Catalonia, and Basque regions. These findings are aligned with the historical secessionist movements and cultural diversity reports supporting the validity of our methodology.

<snippet>This paper deals with the role of reciprocation in the formation of individuals' social networks. We follow the activity of a panel of bloggers over more than a year and investigate the extent to which initiating a relation brings about its reciprocation. We adapt a standard capital investment model to study how reciprocation affects the build-up of the individual social capital of bloggers, as measured by their links and interactions with others. This allows us to measure the role of content production and relationship building in the dynamics of online social networks and to distinguish between the social networking and media aspects of blogging.

<title>Personal network dynamics across the life course: A relationship-related structural approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2023.100567</url>
<snippet>Building on Georg Simmel's concept of "form", the article presents a relationship related structural concept of social relationships that specifically accounts for opportunities and constraints resulting from the fact that relationships are solidified patterns of interaction that, once established, can develop a power of their own (inertia, momentum) that cannot easily be influenced by the involved actors. In this "relationship-related structural approach", social relationships or "forms" can be understood as specific constellations of "basic structural properties", i.e. specifications of various aspects of quantity, of time, of space, of similarity, and including also a certain degree of freedom to enter or quit a relationship, knowledge about one another, and types and degree of institutionalization. The specification of these structural properties impacts the functional capacity of relationships, as well as the dynamics of both relationships and networks, especially the ways in which relationships are formed, maintained, or lost. Referring to various life course transitions from different phases of the life course, it is demonstrated how this approach helps to better understand the dynamics of social relationships and networks and the impact of life events on personal relationships across the life course. Finally, implications of this novel perspective for life course and network research are discussed.

<title>Individual and seasonal variation in contact rate, connectivity and centrality in red fox (&lt;i&gt;Vulpes vulpes&lt;/i&gt;) social groups</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56713-3</url>
<snippet>Examining temporal variation in social connectivity and relating this to individual behaviour can help understand the role of individuals within social groups. Although red foxes are solitary foragers, they form social groups at higher population densities. To investigate the effects of season, sex and status on social connectivity in red fox social groups, we set camera traps for four consecutive seasons to record contact rates and social network metrics at food patches in seven fox territories. Higher food availability was associated with higher contact rates. Individual contact rates peaked in different seasons depending on sex and social status. Dominant foxes held central network positions in all seasons but there was no consistent pattern in social connections within territories, suggesting a greater influence of features such as group size and composition on network structure than seasonal behaviour. Increased extraterritorial movements by males during winter contributed to a significant reduction in local network connectivity. Female network strength did not vary with season, suggesting that females play an important role in maintaining year-round group cohesion. These data advance our understanding of canid social systems, the benefits of group-living in solitary foraging carnivores, and the impacts of management interventions for an ecologically important species.

<title>Evolutionary Dynamics of Homophily and Heterophily</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep22766</url>
<snippet>Most social interactions do not take place at random. In many situations, individuals choose their interaction partners on the basis of phenotypic cues. When this happens, individuals are often homophilic, that is, they tend to interact with individuals that are similar to them. Here we investigate the joint evolution of phenotypic cues and cue-dependent interaction strategies. By a combination of individual-based simulations and analytical arguments, we show that homophily evolves less easily than earlier studies suggest. The evolutionary interplay of cues and cue-based behaviour is intricate and has many interesting facets. For example, an interaction strategy like heterophily may stably persist in the population even if it is selected against in association with any particular cue. Homophily persisted for extensive periods of time just in those simulations where homophilic interactions provide a lower (rather than a higher) payoff than heterophilic interactions. Our results indicate that even the simplest cue-based social interactions can have rich dynamics and a surprising diversity of evolutionary outcomes.

<title>Exploring and visualizing spatial-temporal evolution of patent collaboration networks: A case of China?s intelligent manufacturing equipment industry</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101483</url>
<snippet>With the integration of intelligent manufacturing (IM) technology and the manufacturing industry, the intelligent manufacturing equipment industry (IMEI) has become the focus of a new round of industrial revolution. This integration has led to a new revolution in the manufacturing industry and is key to transforming China into a manufacturing country with international competitiveness. However, China?s IMEI is in the development stage, thus presenting a major challenge to it becoming a competitive core industry. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore the IMEI patent collaboration network and analyze its evolutionary characteristics, which can improve not only the innovation ability of network organizations but also the overall competitiveness of the IMEI. This study employs social network analysis (SNA) to study the evolution of the patent collaboration network of China?s IMEI. The results show that the number of co-patents for the IMEI field in China has obvious stage characteristics, the collaborative innovation patterns adopted by different provinces vary, and the State Grid has a strong influence on the network. The scale of the patent collaboration network is gradually expanding, exhibiting a ?small-world? structure. Jiangsu mainly innovates through intra-provincial collaboration. Provinces such as Beijing, Guangdong and Shandong are more inclined to inter-provincial collaboration.

<snippet>Quantifying the importance and power of individual nodes depending on their position in socio-economic networks constitutes a problem across a variety of applications. Examples include the reach of individuals in (online) social networks, the importance of individual banks or loans in financial networks, the relevance of individual companies in supply networks, and the role of traffic hubs in transport networks. Which features characterize the importance of a node in a trade network during the emergence of a globalized, connected market? Here we analyze a model that maps the evolution of global connectivity in a supply network to a percolation problem. In particular, we focus on the influence of topological features of the node within the underlying transport network. Our results reveal that an advantageous position with respect to different length scales determines the competitiveness of a node at different stages of the percolation process and depending on the speed of the cluster growth.

<title>A set of measures to quantify the dynamicity of longitudinal social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cplx.21690</url>
<snippet>This study proposes a new set of measures for longitudinal social networks (LSNs). A LSN evolves over time through the creation and/or deletion of links among a set of actors (e.g., individuals or organizations). The current literature does feature some methods, such as multiagent simulation models, for studying the dynamics of LSNs. These methods have mainly been utilized to explore evolutionary changes in LSNs from one state to another and to explain the underlying mechanisms for these changes. However, they cannot quantify different aspects of a LSN. For example, these methods are unable to quantify the level of dynamicity shown by an actor in a LSN and its contribution to the overall dynamicity shown by that LSN. This article develops a set of measures for LSNs to overcome this limitation. We illustrate the benefits of these measures by applying them to an exploration of the Enron crisis. These measures successfully identify a significant but previously unobserved change in network structures (both at individual and group levels) during Enron's crisis period.

<title>Global Diversity and Local Consensus in Status Beliefs: The Role of Network Clustering and Resistance to Belief Change</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.15195/v4.a25</url>
<snippet>Formal models of status construction theory suggest that beliefs about the relative social worth and competence of members of different social groups can emerge from face-to-face interactions in task-focused groups and eventually become consensual in large populations. We propose two extensions of earlier models. First, we incorporate the microlevel behavioral assumption of status construction theory that people can become resistant to belief change when a belief appears consensual in their local social environment. Second, we integrate the insight that the macro-level social structure of face-to-face interactions in large populations often is a clustered network structure. Computational experiments identify an outcome that was not anticipated by earlier formalizations. The combination of network clustering at the macrolevel and resistance to belief change at the microlevel can constrain the diffusion of status beliefs and generate regional variation in status beliefs. Further experiments identify conditions under which this outcome obtains.

<snippet>In this study, we analyze the relationship between network structure and economic prosperity in 438 Dutch municipalities. We focus on the structural aspects of social capital theory and test how three forms of social capital- network density, fragmentation (bonding), diversity and geographical distance of ties (bridging)- are associated with economic prosperity at the municipality level. We use data from a Dutch online social network that consists of more than 10 million users to test the hypotheses. We find that communities that have high network diversity are also more prosperous economically, while high network fragmentation is associated with lower prosperity. Contrary to previous literature, we find some support that network density at the community level is negatively associated with economic prosperity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Gender inequities in the online dissemination of scholars' work</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2102945118</url>
<snippet>Unbiased science dissemination has the potential to alleviate some of the known gender disparities in academia by exposing female scholars' work to other scientists and the public. And yet, we lack comprehensive understanding of the relationship between gender and science dissemination online. Our largescale analyses, encompassing half a million scholars, revealed that female scholars' work is mentioned less frequently than male scholars' work in all research areas. When exploring the characteristics associated with online success, we found that the impact of prior work, social capital, and gendered tie formation in coauthorship networks are linked with online success for men, but not for women-even in the areas with the highest female representation. These results suggest that while men's scientific impact and collaboration networks are associated with higher visibility online, there are no universally identifiable facets associated with success for women. Our comprehensive empirical evidence indicates that the gender gap in online science dissemination is coupled with a lack of understanding the characteristics that are linked with female scholars' success, which might hinder efforts to close the gender gap in visibility.

<title>Alcohol consumption as a socially contagious phenomenon in the Framingham Heart Study social network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-54155-0</url>
<snippet>We use longitudinal social network data from the Framingham Heart Study to examine the extent to which alcohol consumption is influenced by the network structure. We assess the spread of alcohol use in a three-state SIS-type model, classifying individuals as abstainers, moderate drinkers, and heavy drinkers. We find that the use of three-states improves on the more canonical two-state classification, as the data show that all three states are highly stable and have different social dynamics. We show that when modelling the spread of alcohol use, it is important to model the topology of social interactions by incorporating the network structure. The population is not homogeneously mixed, and clustering is high with abstainers and heavy drinkers. We find that both abstainers and heavy drinkers have a strong influence on their social environment; for every heavy drinker and abstainer connection, the probability of a moderate drinker adopting their drinking behaviour increases by 40&#37;\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$40\&#37;$$\end{document} and 18&#37;\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$18\&#37;$$\end{document}, respectively. We also find that abstinent connections have a significant positive effect on heavy drinkers quitting drinking. Using simulations, we find that while both are effective, increasing the influence of abstainers appears to be the more effective intervention compared to reducing the influence of heavy drinkers.

<title>Network Position and Police Who Shoot</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002716219901171</url>
<snippet>This study applies the growing field of network science to explore whether police violence is associated with characteristics of an officer's social networks and his or her placement within those networks. To do this, we re-create the network of police misconduct for the Chicago Police Department using more than 38,442 complaints filed against police officers between 2000 and 2003. Our statistical models reveal that officers who shoot at civilians are often "brokers" within the social networks of policing, occupying important positions between other actors in the network and often connecting otherwise disconnected parts of the social structure between other officers within larger networks of misconduct. This finding holds, even net measures of officer activity, career movement, and sociodemographic background. Our finding suggest that policies and interventions aimed at curbing police shootings should include not only individual assessments of risk but also an understanding of officers' positions within larger social networks.

<title>The Network Dynamics of Status: Assimilation and Selection</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/sox040</url>
<snippet>Using longitudinal data that we have collected on friendship and advice relations in a cohort of MBA students, we examine how status affects the dynamics of network ties among peers. Estimates of Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs) suggest that status is a consequence of network ties because over time the level of status attributed to individual students by other students tends to the average level of status attributed to their network partners-a phenomenon we call status assimilation. Status is also an antecedent to network ties because it affects partner selection decisions, giving rise to distinct forms of social attachment. We find that both network-based processes of status assimilation, as well as status-based processes of social selection, are present, but they vary subtly yet significantly across network domains. Students tend to the average level of status of their friends, but not to that of their advisors. High-status students are more active in the friendship network, but more popular in the advice network. We find evidence of performance homophily rather than status homophily: students with similar grades are more likely to exchange friendship and advice ties. High-status students tend to be more central in the advice network, but status attributions spill over through friendship, rather than advice relations. The study documents how the relation between social status and social networks varies both over time, as well as across network domains. The study also demonstrates the importance of accounting for multiplexity-the tendency of a network to operate through another.

<title>Characteristics of the urban environmental regulation network and its impact on carbon emission efficiency in China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03919-0</url>
<snippet>On the basis of 2007-2019 data covering 254 cities in China, we analyze the overall and individual characteristics of the environmental regulation network (ERN) using a modified gravity model and social network analysis (SNA) method and investigate the effect of the degree centrality of the EGN on carbon emission efficiency (CEE). The results suggest that, first, China's municipal environmental regulations exhibit a significant and complex spatial correlation structure. However, the cities are not connected well to each other, resulting in a loose network structure. Second, cities in the Yangtze River Delta, such as Wuxi, Suzhou, and Shanghai, occupy the center of the network, and the degree centrality of approximately 20&#37; of the cities exceeds the average level. Third, the degree centrality of the ERN increases CEE significantly, but its direction and intensity differ significantly according to geographical location, resource endowment and urban size. Fourth, degree centrality improves CEE by reducing the energy intensity of cities. Green innovation and foreign direct investment can strengthen the positive effect of degree centrality on CEE. Degree centrality enhances the CEE of a region but reduces the CEE of neighboring cities through the spatial spillover effect. Therefore, we should focus on promoting low-carbon and green lifestyles, formulate carbon reduction regulations tailored to local conditions, encourage enterprises to apply green technologies, and strengthen cooperation between cities.

<title>VIP-club phenomenon: Emergence of elites and masterminds in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2005.07.005</url>
<snippet>Hubs, or vertices with large degrees, play massive roles in, for example, epidemic dynamics, innovation diffusion, and synchronization on networks. However, costs of owning edges can motivate agents to decrease their degrees and avoid becoming hubs, whereas they would somehow like to keep access to a major part of the network. By analyzing a model and tennis players' partnership networks, we show that combination of vertex fitness and homophily yields a VIP-club made of elite vertices that are influential but not easily accessed from the majority. Intentionally formed VIP members can even serve as masterminds, which manipulate hubs to control the entire network without exposing themselves to a large mass. If based on network topology only, elites are not distinguished from many other vertices. Understanding network data is far from sufficient; individualistic factors greatly affect network structure and functions per se.

<title>Stewardship of global collective behavior</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2025764118</url>
<snippet>Collective behavior provides a framework for understanding how the actions and properties of groups emerge from the way individuals generate and share information. In humans, information flows were initially shaped by natural selection yet are increasingly structured by emerging communication technologies. Our larger, more complex social networks now transfer high-fidelity information over vast distances at low cost. The digital age and the rise of social media have accelerated changes to our social systems, with poorly understood functional consequences. This gap in our knowledge represents a principal challenge to scientific progress, democracy, and actions to address global crises. We argue that the study of collective behavior must rise to a "crisis discipline" just as medicine, conservation, and climate science have, with a focus on providing actionable insight to policymakers and regulators for the stewardship of social systems.

<title>Understanding the intricacy of canid social systems: Structure and temporal stability of red fox (&lt;i&gt;Vulpes vulpes&lt;/i&gt;) groups</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220792</url>
<snippet>Red foxes have a highly flexible social system. Despite numerous studies worldwide, our understanding of the pattern and stability of fox social relationships remains limited. We applied social network analysis to camera trap data collected at high-quality foraging patches to examine the social structure of a population of urban red foxes. Foxes encountered a conspecific on 13&#37; of patch visits, and had significant preferred and avoided companionships in all seasons. They also associated in communities that matched territorial space use, confirming that territories can be analysed separately to increase power without excluding too many social partners. Foxes maintained stable, long-term relationships with other territory residents, but the average longevity of relationships varied seasonally, suggesting that social connectivity, particularly between foxes from different social groups, is influenced by their annual life cycle. The probability of re-association after a given time lag was highest in spring and summer, during cub birth and rearing, and lowest in the winter mating season, when mean relationship duration was shorter. 33&#37; of fox relationships lasted for four consecutive seasons and were probably between territory residents. 14&#37; lasted for around 20 days and were probably between residents and visitors from adjacent territories. The majority (53&#37;) lasted less than one day, particularly during dispersal and mating, and were probably between foxes from non-adjacent social groups. Social structure varied between groups; in one group the death of the dominant male caused significant social disruption for two seasons. This is the first application of social network analysis to multiple red fox social groups. However, our analyses were based on interactions at high quality food patches; social connections may differ when foxes are resting, travelling and foraging elsewhere in their territory. Our results will inform management practices, particularly for disease spread and population control.

<title>The Impact of a Researcher's Structural Position on Scientific Performance: An Empirical Analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0161281</url>
<snippet>This article discusses the nature and structure of scientific collaboration as well as the association between academic collaboration networks and scientific productivity. Based on empirical data gathered from the CVs of 73 researchers affiliated with an academic research network in Canada, this study used social network analysis (SNA) to examine the association between researchers' structural position in the network and their scientific performance. With reference to Granovetter's and Burt's theories on weak ties and structural holes, we argue it is the bridging position a researcher holds in a scientific network that matters most to improve scientific performance. The results of correlation scores between network centrality and two different indicators of scientific performance indicate there is a robust association between researchers' structural position in collaboration networks and their scientific performance. We believe this finding, and the method we have developed, could have implications for the way research networks are managed and researchers are supported.

<title>The Political Complexity of Regional Electricity Policy Formation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/3493492</url>
<snippet>The integration of renewable power supplies into existing electrical grids, or other major technology transitions in electric power, is a complex sociotechnical process. While the technical challenges are well-understood, the process of adapting electricity policy and market rules to these new technologies is understudied. Planning and market rules are a critical determinant of the technical success of renewable energy integration efforts and the financial viability of renewable energy investments. Organizational adaptation can be particularly complex in electric power, where transmission grids cross multiple political boundaries and decisions are made not by central authorities or governments, but in cooperative regional frameworks that must accommodate many divergent interests. We add to a recently emerging literature on the governance of regional organizations that plan and operate electric power grids by developing and illustrating a novel approach to the study of political power in multistakeholder electricity organizations. We use semistructured interviews with participants in a specific regional electric grid authority, the PJM Regional Transmission Operator in the Mid-Atlantic United States, to elicit perceptions of where tensions arise in stakeholder-driven processes for changing PJM's rules and perceptions of those groups of stakeholders that possess political power. We treat these perceptions as hypotheses that can be evaluated empirically using five years of data from PJM on how stakeholders voted on a wide variety of regional electricity policy issues. Representing voting behavior as a network, we use a community detection method to identify strong coalitions of stakeholders in PJM that provide support for some stakeholder perceptions of political power and refute other perceptions. The degree distribution of the voting network exhibits a fat tail relative to those in other canonical graph models. We show, using relatively simple network metrics including degree, betweenness, and the mixing parameter, that the reason for this fat tail in the degree distribution is the existence of swing voters in RTO stakeholder networks. These voters are identifiable in the tail of the degree distribution of the voting network and are influential in pushing highly contentious rule change proposals towards passage or failure. The method we develop is generalizable to other contexts and provides a new framework for the study of regional electricity policy formation.

<title>Can celebrity athletes burst the echo chamber bubble? The case of LeBron James and Lady Gaga</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1012690219855913</url>
<snippet>This study examines the case of basketball superstar LeBron James, who openly identifies as a liberal. Our analysis of LeBron James' Twitter profile revealed normal distribution between liberals and conservatives following his account. We then compared James' followers' distribution to those of the singer Lady Gaga and liberal-tilting sport network ESPN and found that James' followers' distribution represented the most diverse distribution of the three accounts. We further found that James was the only liberal source in most of his conservative followers' profiles. The findings highlight the potency of celebrity athletes to narrow the trend of political polarization.

<title>Association between social networks and discussions regarding advance care planning among Japanese older adults</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0213894</url>
<snippet>Background Older adults' discussions with family, or with physicians, or with both, about advance care planning (ACP) are increasingly regarded as important for the management of end-of-life care, and yet the factors that induce older adults to engage in ACP discussions are poorly understood. For example, in older adults, is stronger connectedness with family and friends (stronger "networks") associated with ACP discussions? By facilitating, or by impeding ACP discussions? We sought to evaluate the associations between ACP discussions and social networks in Japanese older adults. Methods In July 2016 we conducted a cross-sectional survey on 355 community-dwelling patients aged. 65 years visiting community hospital clinics in Fukushima, Japan. We used the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6, the shortest available LSNS scale) to assess social networks and recorded two components of social network structure, marital status (dichotomized as "married" vs. "single / other") and living status ("living with others" vs. "living alone"). One item asked if patients had had ACP discussions. We analyzed the LSNS-6 social network and marital and living status data in relation to the occurrence of ACP discussions using multiple logistic regression models with adjustments for possible confounding factors. Results Respondents' social network was "limited" in 16&#37; of cases; 61&#37; had had ACP discussions. Respondents with a limited social network had a significantly lower tendency to have had ACP discussions than respondents with an "adequate" social network (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.35; 95&#37; confidence interval [CI]: 0.18-0.66; P &lt; 0.001). Marital status and living status were not significantly associated with ACP discussion. Conclusions Among Japanese older adults, weaker social networks may be associated with a lower tendency to discuss ACP. Our findings may help practitioners to quickly screen populations at risk for inadequate ACP discussion by using the LSNS-6.

<title>Product Diffusion Using Advance Selling Strategies: An Online Social Network Perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3207</url>
<snippet>This study analyzes the diffusion of two product types using an advance selling strategy from a social network perspective. We extended the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model by adding a buyer component (SIRB) to the model and conducted an in-depth analysis of transmission probability and purchase probability when using an advance selling strategy. Agent-based simulation indicates that cost reduction and promotional effort have positive effects on profits, while lead time negatively affects them. Statistical analyses indicate that lead time has a U-shaped relationship with profits for non-durable products, but an inverted U-shaped relationship with those for durable products. For both products types, promotional effort has an inverted U-shaped relationship with profits under the condition of low-quality products and an inverted U-shaped relationship in the case of high-quality products. The reasons underlying these results are discussed, followed by implications for firms adopting advance selling strategies.

<title>Subjective Poverty, Material Deprivation Indices and Psychological Distress Among Young Adults: The Mediating Role of Social Capital and Usage of Online Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-021-02729-0</url>
<snippet>The mechanisms underlying the SES-psychological distress association are not fully explored. Based on representative cross-sectional data from Israel for the year 2017 (N = 1508), we examine (1) the association between subjective poverty, material deprivation, social capital, and psychological distress among young adults (20-29 years); and (2) whether social capital mediates the subjective poverty/material deprivation-psychological distress association. Informal social capital includes connections with family and friends, perceived support, and perceived trust, whereas formal social capital includes volunteering and civic and political involvement. An additional aspect was online social network usage. We constructed a structural equation model to explore paths of relationships between subjective poverty, material deprivation, social capital, and psychological distress. Subjective poverty and material deprivation were strong predictors of psychological distress. Informal social capital buffered the negative effect of subjective poverty and material deprivations on psychological distress, whereas use of online social networks increased it. The use of online social networks, however, promoted informal social capital, which, in turn, was a protective factor against psychological distress. Further investigation is needed on which patterns and platforms of online social networks harm and which promote young adults' psychological wellbeing. Informal social capital should be a prominent aspect of both preventive medicine practice and health promotion initiatives among young adults. Policy-makers are called on to support this important means of promoting public health. However, to substantially narrow disparities in psychological distress among young adults, direct action should be taken to reduce poverty and material deprivation.

<title>Mining the Hidden Link Structure from Distribution Flows for a Spatial Social Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/6902027</url>
<snippet>This study aims at developing a non-(semi-)parametric method to extract the hidden network structure from the {0,1}-valued distribution flow data with missing observations on the links between nodes. Such an input data type widely exists in the studies of information propagation process, such as the rumor spreading through social media. In that case, a social network does exist as the media of the spreading process, but its link structure is completely unobservable; therefore, it is important to make inference of the structure (links) of the hidden network. Unlike the previous studies on this topic which only consider abstract networks, we believe that apart from the link structure, different social-economic features and different geographic locations of nodes can also play critical roles in shaping the spreading process, which has to be taken into account. To uncover the hidden link structure and its dependence on the external social-economic features of the node set, a multidimensional spatial social network model is constructed in this study with the spatial dimension large enough to account for all influential social-economic factors. Based on the spatial network, we propose a nonparametric mean-field equation to govern the rumor spreading process and apply the likelihood estimator to make inference of the unknown link structure from the observed rumor distribution flows. Our method turns out easily extendible to cover the class of block networks that are useful in most real applications. The method is tested through simulated data and demonstrated on a data set of rumor spreading on Twitter.

<title>Geographical variability and network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2011.08.003</url>
<snippet>In this paper, we explore the potential implications of geographical variability for the structure of social networks. Beginning with some basic simplifying assumptions, we derive a number of ways in which local network structure should be expected to vary across a region whose population is unevenly distributed. To examine the manner in which these effects would be expected to manifest given realistic population distributions, we then perform an exploratory simulation study that examines the features of large-scale interpersonal networks generated using block-level data from the 2000 U.S. Census. Using a stratified sample of micropolitan and metropolitan areas with populations ranging from approximately 1000 to 1,000,000 persons, we extrapolatively simulate network structure using spatial network models calibrated to two fairly proximate social relations. From this sample of simulated networks, we examine the effect of both within-location and between-location heterogeneity on a variety of structural properties. As we demonstrate, geographical variability produces large and distinctive features in the "social fabric" that overlies it; at the same time, however, many aggregate network properties can be fairly well-predicted from relatively simple spatial demographic variables. The impact of geographical variability is thus predicted to depend substantially on the type of network property being assessed, and on the spatial scale involved. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

<title>Examining the Intergovernmental and Interorganizational Network of Responding to Major Accidents for Improving the Emergency Management System in China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/8935872</url>
<snippet>Since the SARS crisis in 2003, institutionalized emergency management systems have been established in each government level for improving inter-organizational collaboration in China. Major accidents require participation of public organizations affiliated with multiple government levels, and the lack of collaboration and coordination among the involved organizations within the critical time constraints during the response process is an existing problem. In this research, a case study of examining the intergovernmental and cross-sectoral collaboration for responding to a well-known oil pipeline explosion accident in China by a complex network method is conducted. The aim is to obtain managerial insights in improving the existing emergency management system in a centralized political-administrative context, such as China. A mixed method of data collection is applied to identify the participating organizations and to determine the interaction spanning organizational boundaries in both hierarchical and horizontal dimensions. An emergency response network is built and visualized for representing intergovernmental and interorganizational collaboration during the response process of the major accident by social network analysis (SNA) tools. The SNA indicators are used to measure quantitatively the network structure at the levels of the whole network, subnetwork, and node. The obstacles of achieving intergovernmental collaboration are found, and managerial suggestions for improving the existing emergency management system are provided. This research indicates that the Chinese government should pay attention to establishing and sustaining partnerships with private and nonprofit organizations and conduct a blend of hierarchical, market, and network principles in fostering collaboration for addressing major accidents. The public organizations in the local government level are shown to be more active than other participators in coordinating their response operations, and their capability should be emphasized for improvement. Additionally, the interactive relationships among specific emergency function groups and between the affected communities and organizations performing emergency command and coordination function should be strengthened.

<title>An Agent-Based Model of Urgent Diffusion in Social Media</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>During a crisis, understanding the diffusion of information throughout a population will provide insights into how quickly the population will react to the information, which can help those who need to respond to the event. The advent of social media has resulted in this information spreading quicker then ever before, and in qualitatively different ways, since people no longer need to be in face-to-face contact or even know each other to pass on information in an crisis situation. Social media also provides a wealth of data about this information diffusion since much of the communication happening within this platform is publicly viewable. This data trove provides researchers with unique information that can be examined and modeled in order to understand urgent diffusion. A robust model of urgent diffusion on social media would be useful to any stakeholders who are interested in responding to a crisis situation. In this paper, we present two models, grounded in social theory, that provide insight into urgent diffusion dynamics on social networks using agent-based modeling. We then explore data collected from Twitter during four major urgent diffusion events including: (1) the capture of Osama Bin Laden, (2) Hurricane Irene, (3) Hurricane Sandy, and (4) Election Night 2012. We illustrate the diffusion of information during these events using network visualization techniques, showing that there appear to be differences. After that, we fit the agent-based models to the observed empirical data. The results show that the models fit qualitatively similarly, but the diffusion patterns of these events are indeed quite different from each other.

<title>Rapid innovation diffusion in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1400842111</url>
<snippet>Social and technological innovations often spread through social networks as people respond to what their neighbors are doing. Previous research has identified specific network structures, such as local clustering, that promote rapid diffusion. Here we derive bounds that are independent of network structure and size, such that diffusion is fast whenever the payoff gain from the innovation is sufficiently high and the agents' responses are sufficiently noisy. We also provide a simple method for computing an upper bound on the expected time it takes for the innovation to become established in any finite network. For example, if agents choose log-linear responses to what their neighbors are doing, it takes on average less than 80 revision periods for the innovation to diffuse widely in any network, provided that the error rate is at least 5&#37; and the payoff gain (relative to the status quo) is at least 150&#37;. Qualitatively similar results hold for other smoothed best-response functions and populations that experience heterogeneous payoff shocks.

<title>Who runs the arts in England? A social network analysis of arts boards</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2022.101646</url>
<snippet>Recent research on cultural production has drawn attention to significant inequalities. This paper aims to unpack one possible explanation for these inequalities by focusing on the people with ultimate responsibility for arts institutions: the boards of directors. Using data from the UK's Companies House, it analyses the boards of Arts Council England's National Portfolio Organisations. It then "hops" to the other organisations with whom arts organisations also share board members, and their directors. While the network of NPOs is relatively sparse, with most organisations not sharing board members with any others, in the one-hop network the majority of these organisations are indirectly connected to one another. In addition to a large number of arts and cultural organisations, this network also contains a large proportion of film funding companies and financial services companies. The most central company in the network, measured by betweenness, is the Royal Opera House, followed by companies associated with significant tax advantages for their directors. Our results raise questions for the governance of culture, drawing further attention to its ties with financial institutions.

<title>Distributive effervescence: emotional energy and social cohesion in secularizing societies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11186-021-09470-0</url>
<snippet>Research suggests that societies are becoming more materially secure, less intensely religious and that social interactions are increasingly computer mediated. However, sociological theorists have not yet developed robust mechanistic theories explaining how social cohesion might be generated under these new conditions. This is a notable omission because scholars have demonstrated empirically that materially secure, non-religious, people tend to be more individualistic, have more diverse networks, and are less socially engaged than traditionally religious individuals (Zuckerman et al., The nonreligious: Understanding secular people and societies, Oxford University Press, 2016). Does the secularization of societies necessarily imply societal instability, anomie, or isolation? If not, why not? Here, we posit the existence of a continuum of modes of social cohesion that are characterized by a suite of historically contingent variables which impact the volume, scope, and rate of human interactions. This novel theory of "distributive effervescence" specifies how emotional energy might be generated via punctuated interactions with heterogeneous others across diverse settings.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2020.04.005</url>
<snippet>Extending prior literature on stereotypes about ethnic groups and warranting theory, this experimental study examined the effects of exposure to a target Chinese international student's Facebook page with self-generated (stereotypically positive or negative) and/or other-generated wall posts (stereotypically positive or negative) on U.S. participants' (N = 550, M-age = 21.38, SD = 3.82) perceptions of task attractiveness and behavioral tendencies (i.e., willingness to communicate/ cooperate) toward the target. Supporting warranting theory, results demonstrated that when other-generated posts were present and disconfirmed the Facebook page owner's self-generated posts, other-generated posts mitigated the effects of self-generated posts in most cases. However, when other-generated and self-generated wall posts were consistent, other-generated posts produced an averaging effect. In addition, the type of dependent measure, and the dynamic interplay between stereotype content and the valence of self-generated posts also mitigated the warranting effect of other-generated posts.

<snippet>Recent human deaths due to infection by highly pathogenic (H5N1) avian influenza A virus have raised the specter of a devastating pandemic like that of 1917-1918, should this avian virus evolve to become readily transmissible among humans. We introduce and use a large-scale stochastic simulation model to investigate the spread of a pandemic strain of influenza virus through the U.S. population of 281 million individuals for R-0 (the basic reproductive number) from 1.6 to 2.4. We model the impact that a variety of levels and combinations of influenza antiviral agents, vaccines, and modified social mobility (including school closure and travel restrictions) have on the timing and magnitude of this spread. Our simulations demonstrate that, in a highly mobile population, restricting travel after an outbreak is detected is likely to delay slightly the time course of the outbreak without impacting the eventual number ill. For R-0 &lt; 1.9, our model suggests that the rapid production and distribution of vaccines, even if poorly matched to circulating strains, could significantly slow disease spread and limit the number ill to &lt; 10&#37; of the population, particularly if children are preferentially vaccinated. Alternatively, the aggressive deployment of several million courses of influenza antiviral agents in a targeted prophylaxis strategy may contain a nascent outbreak with low R-0, provided adequate contact tracing and distribution capacities exist. For higher R-0, we predict that multiple strategies in combination (involving both social and medical interventions) will be required to achieve similar limits on illness rates.

<title>CONTINGENT ORGANIZATION AS A NETWORK THEORY - THE CULTURE-PERFORMANCE CONTINGENCY FUNCTION</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000169939403700404</url>
<snippet>Network models of market competition are used to advance from two significant research efforts; Lawrence gi Lorsch's (1967) demonstration that the optimum form of organization varies between markets, and Kotter and Heskett's (1992) study of corporate culture and performance. We compare firms in terms of their economic performance, the extent to which they have a strong corporate culture, and the network structure of their market. The value of a strong corporate culture varies between markets; nothing in one market, an asset in more competitive markets. From the variation between markets, we build a culture-performance contingency function that uses the network structure of a firm's market to predict the extent to which a strong corporate culture can be expected to enhance the firm's performance. With the contingency function, and market census data, we infer that the correlation between culture and performance is strong in the American economy, especially in manufacturing. We also use the function to identify reasonable samples of organizations in which the correlation will be weak, The contingency function is an interesting substantive phenomenon in its own right and a valuable analytical tool for generalizing results on sample firms to population conditions.

<title>An Efficient Competitive Control Mechanism for Negative Information Spread in Online Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218127424501724</url>
<snippet>In online social networks (OSNs), the spread of negative information can cause social shocks, endanger public safety and harm public interests. In this paper, to reduce the impact of negative information on the network ecosystem as much as possible, we consider a competitive strategy of mainstream media coverage and construct a competitively regulated reaction-diffusion model of negative information transmission. For this model, we obtain the basic reproduction number of information propagation, the invade numbers of negative information and positive information. Besides, the local and global stabilities of equilibrium states are discussed. Further, steady bifurcation analyses from a positive information equilibrium and a negative information equilibrium are carried out. Finally, we present some numerical simulations to verify the theoretical analysis results and discuss how spatial heterogeneity affects the process of information diffusion. The conclusions are as follows: Increasing the spread of positive information, controlling the spatial heterogeneity of the transmission rate and reducing the diffusion coefficient when spatial heterogeneous transmission rate occurs are beneficial for suppressing the spread of negative information.

<title>The role of social and ecological processes in structuring animal populations: a case study from automated tracking of wild birds</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.150057</url>
<snippet>Both social and ecological factors influence population process and structure, with resultant consequences for phenotypic selection on individuals. Understanding the scale and relative contribution of these two factors is thus a central aim in evolutionary ecology. In this study, we develop a framework using null models to identify the social and spatial patterns that contribute to phenotypic structure in a wild population of songbirds. We used automated technologies to track 1053 individuals that formed 73 737 groups from which we inferred a social network. Our framework identified that both social and spatial drivers contributed to assortment in the network. In particular, groups had a more even sex ratio than expected and exhibited a consistent age structure that suggested local association preferences, such as preferential attachment or avoidance. By contrast, recent immigrants were spatially partitioned from locally born individuals, suggesting differential dispersal strategies by phenotype. Our results highlight how different scales of social decision-making, ranging from post-natal dispersal settlement to fission-fusion dynamics, can interact to drive phenotypic structure in animal populations.

<title>Tackling connections, structure, and meaning in networks: quantitative and qualitative methods in sociological network research</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-011-9492-3</url>
<snippet>The paper systematizes the role of qualitative methods, statistical analyses, and formal network analysis in sociological network research, and argues for their systematic combination. Formal network analysis mainly aims at a description of network structures as well as at an explanation of the behavior of the network at the systemic level. Formal network analysis can also be used in order to explain individual behavior or the existence of individual connections from network structure. Statistical analyses of ego-centered networks are used to correlate individual attributes with the structure and composition of the individual embeddedness, thus providing a statistical explanation of network effects and determinants. Qualitative methods are important for exploring network structures, and for understanding the meaning connected to them. A historical overview shows that these three strands have long co-existed in sociological network research without engaging in combined research efforts. Combinations of these methods prove useful when considering the various aspects of networks (individual connections, structural patterns, and meaning).

<title>NETWORK IMPACT OF SOCIAL INNOVATION INITIATIVES IN MARGINALISED RURAL COMMUNITIES</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2020.04.001</url>
<snippet>The marginalised rural communities are characterised by societal challenges, such as isolation, lack of job opportunities, land abandonment, low quality of life and generally low education. Social Innovation (SI) initiatives may represent an opportunity to strengthen relationships among the members of rural community, by means of the alteration of the existing social networks. In this way, more exchange of information is expected, paving the way for the creation of professional collaborations among firms and other actors. This paper aims at proposing a short-term evaluation framework of effectiveness of a SI initiative in terms of reconfiguration of the social network structure. The described empirical case study is VaZapp', a rural hub located in Southern Italy, which provides innovative solutions to activate social relations amongst farmers, altering hence their network. A well-referenced SI theoretical model, developed within the H2020 project SIMRA (Social Innovation in Marginalised Rural Areas), and the methodology of Social Network Analysis (SNA) were used to verify and measure quantitative and qualitative indicators affected by network intervention activated by VaZapp' initiative. Results show that this SI initiative worked effectively, leading to a +308&#37; in the number of relations and +250&#37; in social network density. In addition, an evident improvement in the quality of the social relations was found, especially in cases where there are direct engagements within VaZapp'. Outcomes suggest that supporting and promoting SI initiatives could become a central discussion point for the rethinking of rural development policies focused on regeneration of social relations' structure.

<title>Evolution of cooperation with asymmetric social interactions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2113468118</url>
<snippet>How cooperation emerges in human societies is both an evolutionary enigma and a practical problem with tangible implications for societal health. Population structure has long been recognized as a catalyst for cooperation because local interactions facilitate reciprocity. Analysis of population structure typically assumes bidirectional social interactions. But human social interactions are often unidirectional-where one individual has the opportunity to contribute altruistically to another, but not conversely-as the result of organizational hierarchies, social stratification, popularity effects, and endogenous mechanisms of network growth. Here we expand the theory of cooperation in structured populations to account for both uni- and bidirectional social interactions. Even though unidirectional interactions remove the opportunity for reciprocity, we find that cooperation can nonetheless be favored in directed social networks and that cooperation is provably maximized for networks with an intermediate proportion of unidirectional interactions, as observed in many empirical settings. We also identify two simple structural motifs that allow efficient modification of interaction directions to promote cooperation by orders of magnitude. We discuss how our results relate to the concepts of generalized and indirect reciprocity.

<title>Empirical analysis of structural properties, macroscopic and microscopic evolution of various Facebook activity networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-016-0465-4</url>
<snippet>Recently, some works have been done in studying activity network as a more realistic representation of users' behavior in online social networks. However, there is a major deficiency of a suitable definition of activity network based on a comprehensive study of various activity networks separately and combined. The main purpose of our research is to understand the differences between users' behavior by various Facebook activities, so as to claim that these networks should not be blindly composed; neither should the result of analyzing each of them individually be generalized to others. For this purpose, degree distribution, small-world phenomenon, degree correlation, reciprocity, and homophily by different attributes of various activity networks are studied. Then, we study densification and shrinking diameter properties and some structural characteristics of activity networks over time. We also examine microscopic evolution of different activity networks. Ultimately, we conclude that there are some differences between users' behavior by various Facebook activities but all evolve almost similarly at macroscopic and microscopic levels. However, post network evolves considerably different from other activity networks. Accordingly, a comprehensive definition for activity network is suggested so that the results of analyzing the modeled activity network fit realistic data.

<title>Friendship networks of the foreign students in schools of Barcelona: impact of class grouping on intercultural relationships</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2016.08.005</url>
<snippet>This paper account for the relational dynamics that take place in high schools: the interculturality level in the networks of foreign students. Relational networks are characterized by their composition based on origin, identifying those exclusively consisting of native students, those in which only foreign students interact, and the intercultural networks themselves, where native and foreign students coexist. At this stage, I analyse the organizational factors that impede the integration of immigrant students in relational networks with presence of native students, as well as other factors that support the establishment of such networks. Specifically, the analysis focuses on how the organization of school classrooms impact the establishment of more or less intercultural relational networks. In short, there is one concern that motivate this paper: the existence of school dynamics that enhance ethnic ghettoization within schools and, therefore, impede social integration. This research includes the analysis of all students enrolled in the last year of compulsory education (16 years-old) of eight high schools in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (for a total of 664 students from 28 classes). The analytical exploitation is based on a quantitative approach and network analysis (UCINET and Netdraw). Main findings show that the identification of the classrooms with certain ability levels seems to imply a greater barrier between classrooms, which can lead to a greater or lower relational cohesion within the class, according to school organitzation. By contrast, ability levels do not have a direct impact on the degree of intercultural contact; although they do exert a significant influence, defining the possibilities of contact between groups.

<title>Peer relations and access to capital in the mathematics classroom: a Bourdieusian social network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01425692.2016.1245129</url>
<snippet>The aim of this article is to explore the structure of social capital in peer networks and its relation to the unequal access of educational resources within mathematics classrooms. We hypothesise that learners can gain access to mathematics through friendship networks which provide more or less help from peers that might sustain (or curtail) their mathematics learning based on a Bourdieusian framework. We report a social network analysis of mutually-recognised helping within friendship groups. This is complemented by observation and interviews that illustrate how different classrooms have different network structures, positioning learners of different ethnic minorities and genders in significantly different ways regarding access to learning. We argue that friendship networks mediate social capital and access to further cultural capital, and that this may help explain structural differences in attainment. Because ethnicity and gender, inter alia, mediate friendship networks, they also mediate access to capital in the classroom.

Drawing on the logic of "distinctiveness theory," which argues that the numeric rarity of a category in a given setting promotes the use of that category as a basis for connecting with others, we hypothesized and found: (a) the tendency to connect with same-gender others was stronger among women than among men; (b) the tendency to connect with same-rank others was stronger among high-ranking employees than among low-ranking employees;

<title>Bridging social network analysis and field theory through multidimensional data analysis: The case of the theatrical field</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2016.12.002</url>
<snippet>In this study, the theatre industry is conceived of as a field of cultural production, and analysed in the framework of Bourdieu's field theory and social network analysis (SNA). The theatrical field is formalized as an affiliation network of companies participating in stage co-productions in Italy's Campania region, over four theatre seasons. Differently from Bourdieu, but similarly to other works in the sociology of culture and the arts, the study focuses on relational and attribute-based dimensions of theatre production, presenting a novel way to combine field theory and SNA. By adopting the positional approach of SNA through Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) and blockmodeling for affiliation networks, the study reveals oppositions among companies by reason of their differential partnerships in co-productions, and a combination of hierarchy and segmentation characterizing the network structure of the field. These oppositions also appear in the 'objective' social space defined by the attributes of companies and co productions (positions and position-takings), showing the unequal distribution of symbolic cultural capital among theatre producers and the latter's inclinations towards different theatrical styles and genres.

<snippet>Social network theory and analysis are applied to examine whether adolescents who fill various social positions that characterize peer group structure differ in prevalence of current smoking. One thousand and ninety-two (1,092) ninth graders in one school system named their three best friends, allowing the identification of each adolescent as clique member, clique liaison, or isolate. At four of five schools, the odds of being a current smoker were significantly higher for isolates than for clique members and liaisons. The relationship was not explained by demographic variables or by the number of friends who smoke.

<title>Networking Interest and Networked Structure: A Quantitative Analysis of Twitter Data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439314527054</url>
<snippet>This study examines the relationship between individuals' networking interests and a group's networked structure. The data set includes 25,651 members and 12,638 mentions from Twitter-mediated communities in South Korea. Using social network and web impact analyses, we investigated the micro- and macro linkage between individuals' interests and groups' structure, the meso-level analysis of individual-to-individual relationships, and the hyperlinked content shared in each community. Findings suggest that different interests of individuals in joining online communities were associated with variations in those communities' network structures: Communities with sociopolitical goals had a denser network structure and communities for interpersonal interests had a more reciprocated network. Communities for information access exhibited greater dependence on a single member, contrary to the communities for information sharing. Types of content shared in the communities also varied by interests. These findings led us to compose a network topology with visual representation, based on sociopolitical, informational, and interpersonal interests.

<title>Co-evolution of a socio-cognitive scientific network: A case study of citation dynamics among astronomers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.11.008</url>
<snippet>This paper aims to understand how a group of academics cite each others' work through time, considering the simultaneous co-evolution of three networks representing their scientific collaboration, the journals in which they publish and institutional membership. It argues that both social and cognitive processes contribute to these dynamics. Two types of network mechanisms are considered specifically: closures by affiliation and closures by association. To assess whether these mechanisms generate the macro features of the network under study, we propose new features for three-mode multilevel networks such as the mixed geodesic distances, mixed degree distributions, and the mixed quadrilateral census. We investigate whether a micro-level model that considers the above-mentioned network mechanisms is able to correctly reproduce these features. We apply stochastic actororiented models (SAOMs) for one-mode and two-mode networks to link the micro-macro processes using a dataset of a scientific community of astronomers from 2013 to 2015. The results suggest that social relationships grounded on scientific collaboration and proximity based on institutional affiliation are more accurately suited to understanding the co-evolution of the network of citations than an alternative approach that merely considers cognitive-based networks measured as the similarity in publishing in the same journals.

<title>Minimal and maximal characteristic path lengths in connected sociomatrices</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2003.10.001</url>
<snippet>The characteristic path length is one of the most important and frequently-invoked characteristics of a social network. Given a specific network, it can be of considerable interest to know how the path length compares to the "best" or "worst" possible configuration for networks with the same number of agents and lines. Heretofore, the literature has relied heavily on asymptotic results for random networks to suggest a lower path length benchmark, and no upper benchmark is commonly used. We provide easily computed bounds for these best and worst cases. The bounds are constructive, so they can be attained, and we identify the network structures that attain them. Probabilistic analyses confirm short path lengths in connected random networks, provide additional insights for small networks not revealed by asymptotic limits, and suggest when maximal path lengths are attained with non-negligible probabilities.

<title>Networks, Brokerage, and State-Led Technology Diffusion in Small Industry</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/690454</url>
<snippet>The concept of embedded autonomy speaks to the importance of coordination and bidirectional information exchange between Weberian bureaucrats and their private sector interlocutors. It has proven influential in the sociology of development, where it originated, and in the broader discipline. But the prospects for bidirectional information exchange depend upon the structure and nature of the private sector, which has been all but overlooked by the literature on embedded autonomy. This article therefore encourages scholars to take private sector structure seriously by bringing existing network analytic methods to bear on the embedded autonomy debate. Specifically, I identify a tension between the requisites of information gathering, which is facilitated by nonredundant ties among actors, and information diffusion, which requires redundant ties; demonstrate how one Mexican agency has resolved this tension in assisting the upgrading of the artisanal ceramics sector; and conclude that the strategic filling of social network holes lies at the heart of effective bureacrats' efforts to promote development.

<title>Geographies of an Online Social Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137248</url>
<snippet>How is online social media activity structured in the geographical space? Recent studies have shown that in spite of earlier visions about the "death of distance", physical proximity is still a major factor in social tie formation and maintenance in virtual social networks. Yet, it is unclear, what are the characteristics of the distance dependence in online social networks. In order to explore this issue the complete network of the former major Hungarian online social network is analyzed. We find that the distance dependence is weaker for the online social network ties than what was found earlier for phone communication networks. For a further analysis we introduced a coarser granularity: We identified the settlements with the nodes of a network and assigned two kinds of weights to the links between them. When the weights are proportional to the number of contacts we observed weakly formed, but spatially based modules resemble to the borders of macro-regions, the highest level of regional administration in the country. If the weights are defined relative to an uncorrelated null model, the next level of administrative regions, counties are reflected.

<title>"Choose Your Classmates, Your GPA Is at Stake!": The Association of Cross-Class Social Ties and Academic Performance</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764213479362</url>
<snippet>This article presents results from an investigation of the association between student academic performance and social ties. Based on social capital and networked learning research, we hypothesized that (a) students' social capital accumulated through their course progression is positively associated with their academic performance and (b) students with more social capital have significantly higher academic performance (operationalized as grade point average). Both hypotheses were supported by results of an empirical study that analyzed 10 years of student course enrolment records (N = 505) in a master's degree program offered through distance education at a Canadian university. These results are consistent with previous studies that looked at social networks built through student interaction in classrooms or computer-mediated communication environments. The significance of this research lies in the simplicity of the method used to establish student social networks from existing course registration records readily available through an institution's student information system. Direct implications of this research are that (a) study plans for students should consider investment in building new social ties in each course during degree programs and (b) readily available data about cross-class networks can be used in software systems supporting study planning.

<title>Displaying things in common to encourage friendship formation: A large randomized field experiment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11129-020-09224-9</url>
<snippet>Friendship formation is of central importance to online social network sites and to society, but can suffer from significant and unequal frictions. In this study, we demonstrate that social networks and policy makers may use an IT-facilitated intervention - displaying things in common (TIC) between users (mutual hometown, interest, education, work, city) - to encourage friendship formation, especially among people who are different from each other. Displaying TIC may update an individual's belief about the shared similarity with another and reduce information friction that may be hard to overcome in offline communication. In collaboration with an online social network, we design and implement a randomized field experiment, which randomly varies the prominence of different types of things in common information when a user (viewer) is browsing a non-friend's profile. The dyad-level exogenous variation, orthogonal to any (un)observed structural factors in viewer-profile's network, allows us to cleanly isolate the role of individuals' preference for TIC in driving network formation and homophily. We find that displaying TIC to viewers may significantly increase their probability of sending a friend request and forming a friendship, and is especially effective for pairs of people who have little in common. Such findings suggest that information intervention is a very effective and zero-cost approach to encourage the formation of weak ties, and also provide the first experimental evidence on the crucial role of individuals' preference (versus structural embeddedness) in network formation. We further demonstrate that displaying TIC could improve friendship formation for a wide range of viewers with different demographics and friendship status, and is more effective when the TIC information is more surprising to the viewer. Our study offers actionable insights to social networks and policy makers on the design of information intervention to encourage friendship formation and improve the diversity of the friendship, at both an aggregate and an individual level.

<title>Trust based attachment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0288142</url>
<snippet>In social systems subject to indirect reciprocity, a positive reputation is key for increasing one's likelihood of future positive interactions [1-13]. The flow of gossip can amplify the impact of a person's actions on their reputation depending on how widely it spreads across the social network, which leads to a percolation problem [14]. To quantify this notion, we calculate the expected number of individuals, the "audience", who find out about a particular interaction. For a potential donor, a larger audience constitutes higher reputational stakes, and thus a higher incentive, to perform "good" actions in line with current social norms [7, 15]. For a receiver, a larger audience therefore increases the trust that the partner will be cooperative. This idea can be used for an algorithm that generates social networks, which we call trust based attachment (TBA). TBA produces graphs that share crucial quantitative properties with real-world networks, such as high clustering, small-world behavior, and powerlaw degree distributions [16-21]. We also show that TBA can be approximated by simple friend-of-friend routines based on triadic closure, which are known to be highly effective at generating realistic social network structures [19, 22-25]. Therefore, our work provides a new justification for triadic closure in social contexts based on notions of trust, gossip, and social information spread. These factors are thus identified as potential significant influences on how humans form social ties.

<title>The geography of the Arab public sphere on Twitter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101327</url>
<snippet>To understand the interplay between geography and online social networks, this paper maps the Arab public sphere on online networks. We analyzed publicly available Twitter data of a large sample of Arab Twitter members (N = 1,500,000). We focused on the influence of two geographic factors - distance between individuals and air travel frequency - as well as the influence of the language of the followers of Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya Twitter accounts on the formation of transnational social ties among Arabs. Distance between individuals and language differences significantly predicted Arabs' social ties. Frequency of airline flights between nations and being a regional television follower strongly predicted social ties as well. From the geographical perspective, then, the findings challenge the online Arab public sphere notion as well as wider theories of space-time compression in the global era. Similarly, the analysis highlights the distinct English and Arabic realms. In contrast, the findings illustrate the important role that regional media plays in promoting an Arab public sphere. Combined, the findings elaborately portray the narrow boundaries of the Arab public sphere on Twitter and illustrates that the fragmented Arab world's offline structure is reflected on Twitter.

<snippet>This is a review of argument and evidence on the connection between social networks and social capital. My summary points are three: (1) Research and theory will better cumulate across studies if we focus an the network mechanisms responsible for social capital effects rather than trying to integrate across metaphors of social capital loosely tied to distant empirical indicators. (2) There is an impressive diversity of empirical evidence showing that social capital is more a function of brokerage across structural holes than closure within a network, bur there are contingency factors. (3) The two leading network mechanisms can be brought together in a productive way within a more general model of social capital. Structural holes are the source of value added, but network closure can be essential to realizing the value buried in the holes.

<title>Structure and Functions of Online Communities: Network Mapping of HIV-relevant groups in VK.com SNS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>With the rapid growth of online social network sites (SNS), the issue of health-related online communities and its social and behavioral outcomes has become increasingly popular in Internet studies and sociology of health and medicine. This paper presents the results of empirical study investigating the structure of the 'friendship' networks and participants' communicative activity within 15 online groups on VK.com SNS. In this pilot study we seek to trace the relation between declared aims (social functions) and structure of online groups devoted to the HIV/AIDS theme. First, we propose a classification of online HIV-related groups according to their declared purposes and actual social functions. The most widespread group types on VK.com SNS are HIV activists, HIV-infected dating groups, AIDS denialists movement groups, online pages of offline organizations and social support groups. Second, we identify and describe several patterns of network structure and user behavior among these groups. We distinguish five types of community structure: tight crowd, polarized crowd, stratified structure, clustered network and disintegrated structure. Finally, we find and interpret relation between the purposes and functions, on the one hand, and network structure of online communities, on the other. Tight crowd networks mainly occur in dating groups for HIV-infected persons, and links in them are determined by users' gender (homogeneous or heterogeneous ties prevail). Stratified structure is related to HIV activists, especially to AIDS denialists movement groups. Crucial factor of network formation for this pattern is participation in public discussion within a group. Active users form a cohesive community while passive users stay isolated or connected with just a few active users. Our findings are consistent with some previous research of communication network structures on other social media platforms.

<title>Extended structures of mediation: Re-examining brokerage in dynamic networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2013.02.001</url>
<snippet>In this paper we revisit the concept of brokerage in social networks. We elaborate on the concept of brokerage as a process, identifying three distinct classes of brokerage behavior. Based on this process model, we develop a framework for measuring brokerage opportunities in dynamic relational data. Using data on emergent inter-organizational collaborations, we employ the dynamic brokerage framework to examine the relationship between organizational attributes and coordination in the evolving network. Comparing the findings of our process-based definition with traditional, static approaches, we identify important dimensions of organizational action that would be missed by the latter approach.

<title>Social networking sites and low-income teenagers: between opportunity and inequality</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1139614</url>
<snippet>Recent studies on social networking sites (SNSs) reveal that users' social background is not a significant predictor of participation in this type of social media. The broad user bases of Facebook and other social media platforms also appear to suggest that social background no longer affects access to SNSs. A small number of studies even claim that in the participatory web environment, social content is more likely to be created by non-elites, such as lower-income people or racial minorities [Blank, G.(2013). Who creates content? Stratification and content creation on the Internet. Information, Communication &amp; Society, 16(4), 590-612]. Nevertheless, engagement with SNSs also reproduces inequalities, for example via class- and ethnic-based self-segregation' [boyd, d.(2012). White flight in networked publics? How race and class shaped American teen engagement with MySpace and Facebook. In L.Nakamura &amp; P.A.Chow-White (Eds.), Race after the internet (pp.203-222). NewYork, NY: Routledge]. Drawing on a large-scale survey (N=2327) and a set of 56 interviews with Italian teenagers, the current paper explores the persistent influence of socio-economic background and cultural capital in adolescents' use of SNSs. The research findings show that, although structural variables inevitably influence their participation in social media, teenagers from lower-income' families are more enthusiastic about the communication and relational features of these sites. In contrast, their peers from elite' families focus on the capital-enhancing opportunities offered by SNSs and display a critical stance that leads them to limit their social activities on these platforms. Overall, the results suggest that SNSs are not exempt from digital inequalities, but nonetheless provide novel opportunities to lower-income teenagers.

<title>Clustered marginalization of minorities during social transitions induced by co-evolution of behaviour and network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep30790</url>
<snippet>Large-scale transitions in societies are associated with both individual behavioural change and restructuring of the social network. These two factors have often been considered independently, yet recent advances in social network research challenge this view. Here we show that common features of societal marginalization and clustering emerge naturally during transitions in a co-evolutionary adaptive network model. This is achieved by explicitly considering the interplay between individual interaction and a dynamic network structure in behavioural selection. We exemplify this mechanism by simulating how smoking behaviour and the network structure get reconfigured by changing social norms. Our results are consistent with empirical findings: The prevalence of smoking was reduced, remaining smokers were preferentially connected among each other and formed increasingly marginalized clusters. We propose that self-amplifying feedbacks between individual behaviour and dynamic restructuring of the network are main drivers of the transition. This generative mechanism for co-evolution of individual behaviour and social network structure may apply to a wide range of examples beyond smoking.

<title>Patterns of cross-orientation friendships in high schools</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2009.10.001</url>
<snippet>Previous studies indicate that school friendship networks of sexual minority students (students with non-heterosexual orientations) consist mostly of straight peers, but little is known about these straight friends. This paper examines what background characteristics predict straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends by analyzing friendship nomination data from two large high schools included in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Straight females are more likely than straight males to have cross-orientation friendships particularly with sexual minority males. Like friendships among straight students, cross-orientation friendships show a strong homophilous tendency-straight students choose sexual minority friends within their grade levels, racial groups, and academic aptitude levels. Beyond homophily, white race and high levels of academic aptitude and parent education increase straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends in some gender combinations, consistent with previous research showing the links between these backgrounds and positive attitudes toward sexual minorities.

<title>Link creation and information spreading over social and communication ties in an interest-based online social network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds12</url>
<snippet>Complex dynamics of social media emerge from the interaction between the patterns of social connectivity of users and the information exchanged along such social ties. Unveiling the underlying mechanisms that drive the evolution of online social systems requires a deep understanding of the interplay between these two aspects. Based on the case of the aNobii social network, an online service for book readers, we investigate the dynamics of link creation and the social influence phenomenon that may trigger information diffusion in the social graph. By confirming that social partner selection is strongly driven by structural, geographical, and topical proximity, we develop a machine-learning social link recommender for individual users trained on a set of features selected as best predictive out of several and we test it on the still widely unexplored domain of a network of interest. We also analyze the influence process from the two distinct perspectives of users and items. We show that link creation plays an immediate effect on the alignment of user profiles and that the established social ties are a good substrate for social influence. We quantitatively measure influence by tracking the patterns of diffusion of specific pieces of information and comparing them with appropriate null models. We discover an appreciable signal of social influence even though item consumption is a very slow process in this context. All the detected patterns of social attachment and influence are observed to be stronger when considering the social subgraph on which communication effectively occurs. Based on our study of the dynamics of the aNobii social network, we investigate the possibility to predict the evolution of such a complex social system.

<title>Leadership in informal stormwater governance networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222434</url>
<snippet>Recent transitions in the governance of urban stormwater, specifically developments that leverage the environmental and social benefits of green infrastructure (GI) including infiltration and neighborhood stabilization, often require capacities beyond those of any single municipal- or regional-scale organization. In many cities, transitions toward green storm water infrastructure have been shepherded by networks of individuals spanning a diversity of organizations from governments to NGOs. These networks are often informal, that is, not established by legal mandate, governing authority, or formal agreement, and are often striking for their lack of formal hierarchy or formal leadership. Previous scholarship has revealed the importance of leadership in the development and efficacy of these multiorganizational, cross-sector environmental governance networks, but research has yet to empirically investigate and characterize informal network leaders within the context of GI for stormwater mitigation. To address this gap, we designed and administered a social network analysis (SNA) survey to individuals in a regional network of GI stormwater management professionals in and around Cleveland, Ohio USA. We collected network data on individual relationships, including collaboration and trust, and tested the impact of these relationships on peer-recognition of leaders in the GI network. Our findings suggest that network size, frequency of collaboration, and individual position within the network specifically, betweenness centrality and openness defined and likely supported leaders in the stormwater governance network. Leaders in this non-hierarchical, multi-institution context were more likely to be women and brokerage roles within the network benefitted women, not men, which contrasts with previous findings from research on single-organization and corporate networks. The implications of this research suggest that informal environmental governance networks, such as the GI network investigated, differ substantially from the generally more hierarchical networks of organizations. This finding is useful for municipalities and regional authorities grappling with complex environmental challenges, including transitions in strategies to manage excess stormwater for the protection of municipal drinking water sources and urban freshwater ecosystems.

<title>Anomaly detection in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.05.002</url>
<snippet>Anomalies in online social networks can signify irregular, and often illegal behaviour. Detection of such anomalies has been used to identify malicious individuals, including spammers, sexual predators, and online fraudsters. In this paper we survey existing computational techniques for detecting anomalies in online social networks. We characterise anomalies as being either static or dynamic, and as being labelled or unlabelled, and survey methods for detecting these different types of anomalies. We suggest that the detection of anomalies in online social networks is composed of two sub-processes; the selection and calculation of network features, and the classification of observations from this feature space. In addition, this paper provides an overview of the types of problems that anomaly detection can address and identifies key areas for future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Better, Faster, Stronger: The Evolution of Co-authorship in International Management Research Between 1990 and 2016</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440211061561</url>
<snippet>As a border-transcending discipline, the advancement of international management research depends on collaboration between scholars, universities, and nations to account for the diversity and complexity of management phenomena. Yet, relatively little is known about how international management has evolved as a field of research. We address this gap by examining the evolution of collaboration patterns on three levels of analysis, applying the concepts of cumulative advantage, preferential attachment, and isomorphic behavior in a diachronic network analysis. Based on 6,874 articles published between 1990 and 2016 in eight international management journals, our analysis shows that collaboration is driven by a few key players on each level. Although the US and UK still represent hubs, semi-peripheral actors from Europe and Asia enter the landscape. Nevertheless, non-western actors are still underrepresented. We tie this effect to the expertise-based hegemonic status of American and British business schools and dynamics of cumulative advantage on country-level.

<title>Gender, body size and social relations in American high schools</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>To investigate the role of body size in social networks, this study estimated cross-nested multilevel network models (p) with longitudinal data from the 16 saturated schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. As body mass index increased, the likelihood of being nominated by schoolmates as friends - but not the likelihood of nominating others as friends decreased. This trend was more pronounced among girls. Moreover, similarity in body mass index strongly predicted friendship formation. These findings were not explained by correlates (e.g., academic achievement) of both body size and friendship dynamics. Thus, the connection between body size and high school social relations was largely a function of the stigmatization of heavier body sizes, especially for girls, and of homophily.

<title>Impact of social network structure on content propagation: A study using YouTube data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11129-011-9105-4</url>
<snippet>We study how the size and structure of the local network around a node affects the aggregate diffusion of products seeded by it. We examine this in the context of YouTube, the popular video-sharing site. We address the endogeneity problems common to this setting by using a rich dataset and a careful estimation methodology. We empirically demonstrate that the size and structure of an author's local network is a significant driver of the popularity of videos seeded by her, even after controlling for observed and unobserved video characteristics, unobserved author characteristics, and endogenous network formation. Our findings are distinct from those in the peer effects literature, which examines neighborhood effects on individual behavior, since we document the causal relationship between a node's local network position and the global diffusion of products seeded by it. Our results provide guidelines for identifying seeds that provide the best return on investment, thereby aiding managers conducting buzz marketing campaigns on social media forums. Further, our study sheds light on the other substantive factors that affect video consumption on YouTube.

<title>A Stakeholder Network for Managing Multiple Forest Stressors and Roadside Forests</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2023.2267500</url>
<snippet>Roadside forests are susceptible to damage from storm events given their exposure and related vulnerability to impacts of multiple stressors. Challenges to management are further complicated in exurban landscapes, where roadside forests are interspersed among fragmented land ownership entities with diverse management objectives. Our objective was to evaluate forest management community information sharing about biophysical stressors affecting roadside vegetation for multiple forestland tract types in Connecticut. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews (n = 39). Results from social network analysis illustrated network structure and interrelationship patterns among community members. Overall network cohesion was low. Core network positions were dominated by few stakeholders. Communication occurred among subgroups comprised of individuals representing several different stakeholder occupation groups. Low cohesion may be inherent of the fragmented exurban landscape with relations focused on shared objectives. Community longevity may depend upon maintaining core-position connections and a less-centralized network composed of individuals from various occupations.

<title>Anagraphical relationships and crime specialization within Cosa Nostra</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2020.07.011</url>
<snippet>The aim of the present work is to investigate the relationships established within Cosa Nostra, by making use of networks and complex-systems methods. The analysis is performed at three different levels, that is, individuals, groups within mafia syndicates, and relationships amongst mafia syndicates. The reported empirical analysis is based on the criminal records of 632 affiliates to Cosa Nostra selected from a set of 125 judgements emitted by the Palermo courts from 2000 to 2014. According to the criminal records of the Palermo Prosecutor Office, such a dataset includes approximately 10&#37; of the whole population of Cosa Nostra affiliates in western Sicily. Furthermore, the vital statistics of 235 subjects sentenced for mafia crimes and the one of their relatives complemented the database that, overall, includes about 4000 subjects. Our results show that mafia syndicates are not specialized in terms of criminal activity, rather they show a strong territorial attachment and are involved in heterogeneous criminal activities. Since syndicates insist on a delimited territory, young affiliates are selected on a territorial basis according to the significance and variety of their past criminal activity. Once inside a syndicate, affiliates tend to specialize in a few criminal activities, depending on their attitudes and the needs of the organization. Finally, despite the fact that the vast majority of mafia affiliates are males, our results highlight that female subjects are crucial to form and consolidate alliances between mafia syndicates through suitable marriages.

<title>Link prediction in complex network using information flow</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-41476-9</url>
<snippet>Link prediction in complex networks has recently attracted a great deal of attraction in diverse scientific domains, including social and biological sciences. Given a snapshot of a network, the goal is to predict links that are missing in the network or that are likely to occur in the near future. This problem has both theoretical and practical significance; it not only helps us to identify missing links in a network more efficiently by avoiding the expensive and time consuming experimental processes, but also allows us to study the evolution of a network with time. To address the problem of link prediction, numerous attempts have been made over the recent years that exploit the local and the global topological properties of the network to predict missing links in the network. In this paper, we use parametrised matrix forest index (PMFI) to predict missing links in a network. We show that, for small parameter values, this index is linked to a heat diffusion process on a graph and therefore encodes geometric properties of the network. We then develop a framework that combines the PMFI with a local similarity index to predict missing links in the network. The framework is applied to numerous networks obtained from diverse domains such as social network, biological network, and transport network. The results show that the proposed method can predict missing links with higher accuracy when compared to other state-of-the-art link prediction methods.

<title>Global Network Inference from Ego Network Samples: Testing a Simulation Approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2014.994621</url>
<snippet>Network sampling poses a radical idea: that it is possible to measure global network structure without the full population coverage assumed in most network studies. Network sampling is only useful, however, if a researcher can produce accurate global network estimates. This article explores the practicality of making network inference, focusing on the approach introduced in Smith (2012). The method uses sampled ego network data and simulation techniques to make inference about the global features of the true, unknown network. The validity check here includes more difficult scenarios than previous tests, including those that go beyond the initial scope conditions of the method. I examine networks with a skewed degree distribution and surveys that limit the number of social ties a respondent can list. For each network/survey combination, I take a random ego network sample, run the simulation method, and compare the results to the true values (using measures of connectivity and cohesion). I also test the method on local measures of network structure. The results, on the whole, are encouraging. The method produces good estimates even in cases where the degree distribution is skewed and the survey is strongly restricted. I also find that is it better to not truncate the survey if possible. If the survey must be restricted, the researcher would do well to infer the missing data, rather than use the raw data naively.

The constructed network captures most important relations in international trade. The overall network displays a tree-like hierarchical structure. It is organized around global central countries (especially the US, China, and Germany) under which there are more levels of local centers. We develop a model that uses country behavior in local triadic environment to account for the formation of such network structure. The census of triads confirms the applicability of this model.

<title>Do social ties foster firms' environmental innovation? The moderating effect of resource bricolage</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2020.1821876</url>
<snippet>While social ties are central to the field of innovation, the research on the relationship between social ties and environmental innovation is lacking. Based on the resource-based view and social network theory, we construct a research model for identifying the relationships between social ties, resource bricolage, and environmental innovation; we use this to examine the impacts of business, political, and research and development (R&amp;D) ties on firms' levels of radical and incremental eco-innovation, as well as the moderating role of resource bricolage. Multiple regression analysis using survey data from 289 Chinese manufacturing firms is conducted. The results show that political and R&amp;D ties can effectively promote radical eco-innovation, while business and political ties promote incremental eco-innovation. Furthermore, resource bricolage plays a positive moderating role in the relationships between firms' political ties and environmental innovation. These conclusions have certain implications for firms, offering useful insight on how to take full advantage of social ties to acquire various resources and harness resource bricolage strategies to support environmental innovation.

<title>Places That Bond and Bind: On the Interplay of Space, Places, and Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/si.v10i3.5309</url>
<snippet>Social networks of socially disadvantaged individuals can help them in coping with everyday life and avoiding social exclusion. At the same time, social ties also have the power to bind an individual to their disadvantageous situation, perpetuating the risks of social exclusion. One mechanism through which ties can be established are "foci": extra-network structures around which common interactions occur (e.g., family, workplace, clubs) that usually have spatial anchor points (places) where joint interactions happen. To better understand this interplay of places and networks, we use a methodological novelty that connects a person's everyday places with their ego-centred network (two-mode network). We analyse in depth two cases (elderly women living alone) from a mixed-methods study conducted in rural peripheries in eastern Germany, and we combine data from GPS tracking, qualitative interviews, and egocentric networks. A central finding of our analysis is that tie formation in places is more successful if ego has certain resources (e.g., cultural, financial, or time resources) that allow them to utilise places as foci-hence, ego and places must "match" in their characteristics. Beyond that, the existing foci (and their spatial anchoring as places in everyday life) in which ego is integrated must be considered as structures. Even if a person has enough resources and easy access to places with characteristics that promote contact, this does not automatically mean that they will form ties in such places, as the person's network plays a major role in whether they frequent these places and establish new ties there.

<title>Gift-Giving and Network Structure in Rural China: Utilizing Long-Term Spontaneous Gift Records</title>

<snippet>The tradition of keeping written records of gift received during household ceremonies in many countries offers researchers an underutilized means of data collection for social network analysis. This paper first summarizes unique features of the gift record data that circumvent five prevailing sampling and measurement issues in the literature, and we discuss their advantages over existing studies at both the individual level and the dyadic link level using previous data sources. We then document our research project in rural China that implements a multiple wave census-type household survey and a long-term gift record collection. The pattern of gift-giving in major household social events and its recent escalation is analyzed. There are significantly positive correlations between gift network centrality and various forms of informal insurance. Finally, economic inequality and competitive marriage market are among the main demographic and socioeconomic determinants of the observed gift network structure.

<title>Globalization and player recruitment: How teams from European top leagues broker migration flows of footballers in the global transfer network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1012690220919676</url>
<snippet>Theories about how Europe's clubs drive the global migration of football players argue that teams recruit in culturally similar and historically linked countries, in global value-added chains, or in their home country and abroad in far-flung countries. However, most of these theories on club behavior are empirically thin, because researchers have so far analyzed stocks of players in teams rather than flows of players between teams. To understand how teams drive the globalization of football's labor market, this study uses social network analysis to examine how teams from Europe's top eight leagues broker the global transfer network encompassing 1700 professional clubs in 82 countries. Results demonstrate that European elite teams do not scout globally, but rather recruit from rivals in European top leagues. Clubs one tier below the elite hire both in their home country and across European and Latin-American leagues. The majority of European teams focus their recruitment on their home country and occasionally hire from neighboring countries. How teams recruit in the global transfer market might thus be better understood through the interplay between the risky business of hiring players and the resources teams have at their disposal.

<title>Leaving us in tiers: can homophily be used to generate tiering effects?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-011-9088-4</url>
<snippet>Substantial evidence indicates that our social networks are divided into tiers in which people have a few very close social support group, a larger set of friends, and a much larger number of relatively distant acquaintances. Because homophily-the principle that like seeks like-has been suggested as a mechanism by which people interact, it may also provide a mechanism that generates such frequencies and distributions. However, our multi-agent simulation tool, Construct, suggests that a slight supplement to a knowledge homophily model-the inclusion of several highly salient personal facts that are infrequently shared-can more successfully lead to the tiering behavior often observed in human networks than a simplistic homophily model. Our findings imply that homophily on both general and personal facts is necessary in order to achieve realistic frequencies of interaction and distributions of interaction partners. Implications of the model are discussed, and recommendations are provided for simulation designers seeking to use homophily models to explain human interaction patterns.

<title>Perceived group cohesion versus actual social structure: A study using social network analysis of egocentric Facebook networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2018.04.004</url>
<snippet>Research on group cohesion often relies on individual perceptions, which may not reflect the actual social structure of groups. This study draws on social network theory to examine the relationship between observable structural group characteristics and individual perceptions of group cohesion. Leveraging Facebook data, we extracted and partitioned the social networks of 109 participants into groups using a modularity algorithm. We then surveyed perceptions of cohesion, and computed group density and size using social network analysis. Out of six linear mixed effects models specified, a random intercept and fixed slope model with group size as a predictor of perceived group cohesion emerged as best fitting. Whereas group density was not linked to perceived cohesion, size had a small negative effect on perceived cohesion, suggesting that people perceive smaller groups as more cohesive. We discuss the potential of social network analysis, visualization tools, and Facebook data for advancing research on groups.

<title>The micro-foundations of elite politics: conversation networks and elite conflict during China's reform era</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11186-023-09530-7</url>
<snippet>In this article, we explore the micro-foundations of elite politics by focusing on changes in network structures that emerge from informal conversations. Empirically, we offer a novel "situational conflict" explanation to account for the puzzle of why reformist leaders were periodically ousted during China's reform era (1977-1992), emphasizing the unexpected power collision that catalyzed the violent crackdown on the Tiananmen movement in 1989. To do so, we employ network analysis and narrative to utilize an original dataset of elite conversations and primary sources that have only recently been made available. We find that ideological cleavage and manipulative brokerage produced each conflict to varying degrees but were contingent on the relational structure arising from elite conversational interactions. Furthermore, the actual unfolding of those conflicts often resulted from key actors' discrepant understandings of the changing relationships via ongoing interactions at vital moments, such as during the Tiananmen movement. Integrating micro-sociological theories and network analysis, our work has methodological and theoretical implications for unpacking the black box of elite politics and its role in macro-historical change.

<title>OPINION DIFFUSION ON MULTILAYER SOCIAL NETWORKS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219525917500151</url>
<snippet>In this paper, to reveal the influence of multilayer network structure on opinion diffusion in social networks, we study an opinion dynamics model based on DeGroot model on multilayer networks. We find that if the influence matrix integrating the information of connectedness for each layer and correlation between layers is strongly connected and aperiodic, all agents' opinions will reach a consensus. However, if there are stubborn agents in the networks, regular agents' opinions will finally be confined to the convex combinations of the stubborn agents'. Specifically, if all stubborn agents hold the same opinion, even if the agents only exist on a certain layer, their opinions will diffuse to the entire multilayer networks. This paper not only characterizes the influence of multilayer network topology and agent attribute on opinion diffusion in a holistic way, but also demonstrates the importance of coupling agents which play an indispensable role in some social and economic situations.

<title>Networks of Contention: The Shape of Online Transnationalism in Early Twenty-First Century Social Movement Coalitions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2013.832621</url>
<snippet>The study of new media use by transnational social movements is central to contemporary investigations of social contention. In order to shed light on the terrain in which the most recent examples of online mobilization have grown and developed, this paper combines the interest in the transnational dynamics of social contention and the exploration of the use of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) for protest action. In specific terms, the study investigates how early twenty-first century social movement coalitions used Internet tools to build symbolically transnational collective identities. By applying a hyperlink network analysis approach, the study focuses on a website network generated by local chapters of the World Social Forum (WSF), one of the earliest social movement coalitions for global justice. The sample network, selected through snowball sampling, is composed of 222 social forum websites from around the world. The study specifically looks at hyperlinks among social forum websites as signs of belonging and potential means of alliance. The analysis uses network measures, namely of cohesion, centrality, structural equivalence and homophily, to test dynamics of symbolic collective identification underlying the WSF coalition. The findings show that in early twenty-first century transnational contention, culture and place still played a central role in the emergence of transnational movement networks.

<title>Networks rewired: quota enforcement and the unintended mobilization of native place ties</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/soae152</url>
<snippet>We explore how institutional designs can have unintended consequences, especially by rewiring social networks. Using archival data on the civil-service examinations in historical China, we argue that the enforcement of a regional quota system in 1427 reshaped group boundaries along native place, turned emotional affinities for one's hometown into political stakes, and reinforced the influence of native place ties among political elites. Analyzing approximately 30,000 individual records, we confirm this argument by documenting a macro-level shift from a highly unequal to a more balanced provincial distribution of students who passed the examinations following the enforcement of the quota system. As native place became a primary basis for network homophily, elites deliberately cultivated these connections, seizing the opportunity as ad hoc examiners to provide preferential treatment based on shared place of origin. Our micro-level analysis of 12,752 passing students between 1400 and 1580 identifies this in-group favoritism, with examiners often ranking students from their own provinces higher. A mechanism of safeguarding political stakes underscores this baseline effect, which became more pronounced during the quota stage, especially under weaker state capacity, among examiners from disadvantaged provinces, and when examiners had greater vested interest in their hometown. These findings enrich theories of group boundaries and categorization, network homophily and formation, and the unintended consequences of institutional designs while also providing policy insights for affirmative action.

<title>Networked collective intelligence improves dissemination of scientific information regarding smoking risks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227813</url>
<snippet>Despite substantial investments in public health campaigns, misunderstanding of health-related scientific information is pervasive. This is especially true in the case of tobacco use, where smokers have been found to systematically misperceive scientific information about the negative health effects of smoking, in some cases leading smokers to increase their prosmoking bias. Here, we extend recent work on `networked collective intelligence' by testing the hypothesis that allowing smokers and nonsmokers to collaboratively evaluate anti-smoking advertisements in online social networks can improve their ability to accurately assess the negative health effects of tobacco use. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we conducted an online experiment where smokers and nonsmokers (N = 1600) were exposed to anti-smoking advertisements and asked to estimate the negative health effects of tobacco use, either on their own or in the presence of peer influence in a social network. Contrary to popular predictions, we find that both smokers and nonsmokers were surprisingly inaccurate at interpreting anti-smoking messages, and their errors persisted if they continued to interpret these messages on their own. However, smokers and nonsmokers significantly improved in their ability to accurately interpret anti-smoking messages by sharing their opinions in structured online social networks. Specifically, subjects in social networks reduced the error of their risk estimates by over 10 times more than subjects who revised solely based on individual reflection (p &lt; 0.001, 10 experimental trials in total). These results suggest that social media networks may be used to activate social learning that improves the public's ability to accurately interpret vital public health information.

<title>Thinking you&amp;apos;re different matters more for belonging than being different</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58252-y</url>
<snippet>Belonging to a community is essential for wellbeing, but potentially unattainable for those dissimilar from a group. In the present work, we ask whether belongingness is better predicted by acting and thinking like peers or believing you act and think like peers. Students (N = 1181) reported their belonging and how much they, their friends, and an "average student" endorsed local behavioral norms and general values. We calculated difference scores for behaviors and values capturing perceived similarity to the average, actual similarity to the average, and accuracy around the norm. Key results indicate that perceived behavioral similarity to the average, when controlling for other differences, predicts belonging and most robustly mediates between identity and belonging. Using social network analysis, we find behavioral differences from friends are meaningfully linked to network density and racial homophily. Efficient interventions for enhanced belonging could highlight similarities between students and their peers.

<title>DETECTION OF EXPERIMENTAL EFFECTS IN SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-8733(94)90009-4</url>
<snippet>Descriptive and inferential statistical techniques exist for the analysis of social networks, but to date the inferential methods have been limited to the comparison of one network to its hypothesized population parameters (analogous to a one-sample t-test), or the comparison of multiple relational structures measured on the same group of actors (analogous to a correlation coefficient). In this paper, we explore techniques for comparing network structures when each network comprised an entirely different set of actors (analogous to a two-sample t-test or a between-subjects analysis of variance). Such methods for between-group comparisons are critical in theory testing, where a researcher varies an experimental factor for the purposes of studying its impact on some dependent variable (e.g. the resulting network structure). This ability to test the significance of manipulated factors (like ANOVA) would provide another important means by which social network analyses would be an aid to researchers. We propose several such statistical methods for comparing network interactions. There are many areas of substantive research in which groups are examined under different operating conditions, and it seems reasonable to study these inter-related actors as players in a network, and test the significance of the factors that had been experimentally manipulated, thereby capitalizing on the strengths of both network analyses and the logic of analysis of variance and experimental design. In this paper, we illustrate our proposed methods on data representing coalitions formed under different experimental conditions.

<title>Do diverse geographical contexts lead to diverse friendship networks? A multilevel analysis of Belgian survey data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.09.003</url>
<snippet>The choice-constraint approach assumes that the choice of one's friends will be determined by both individual choices and the constraints imposed by one's interaction context. Trends towards homophily however, might counteract this effect if actors consistently seek interaction partners with the same background characteristics. In this study we investigate the impact of community level diversity on the cultural diversity of friendship networks. Based on a multilevel analysis of recent survey data from Flanders (Belgium). we demonstrate that community level diversity has a significant but limited impact on ethnic and religious friendship network diversity. Controlling for individual level characteristics, residents of ethnically diverse communities report more ethnically and religiously diverse friendships. The fact that ethnic and religious diversity overlap to such a large extent suggests that both divisions are closely related in contemporary secularized European societies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

<title>Characteristics and driving factors of the technology cooperation network evolution: a case study of solid waste treatment field in China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2021.1979207</url>
<snippet>The construction and development of technology cooperation network are very important to improve the efficiency of technology R&amp;D. Based on the cooperative patent data in the field of solid waste treatment in China, this paper analyses the structural, spatial and organisational characteristics of the technology cooperation network evolution by using the social network analysis (SNA) method. Meanwhile, the exponential random graph model (ERGM) is used to explore the driving factors of the network evolution. The present results show that the network tends to form a convergent structure and transitive structure, while the intermediary structure is not conducive to the formation of the network. The R&amp;D capability of the entity has no obvious impact on the network evolution, but the positive impact of degree centrality is significant. The negative influence of the structural holes gradually appears in the late stage of network evolution. The geographical homophily has a long-lasting and significant positive effect on network evolution. However, the effect of organisational homophily on the network evolution gradually weakens over time. This study expands the research perspective of technology cooperation network and provides a practical reference for promoting technical cooperation in the field of solid waste treatment.

<title>Is Together Better? Investigating the Relationship Between Network Dynamics and Congregations' Vitality and Sustainability</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13644-022-00496-z</url>
<snippet>Background Although few studies have explored predictors of congregational vitality (i.e., ministry-oriented strengths, not attendance or growth) and sustainability, inter-organizational relationships matter for organizational wellbeing because of their impact on trust, cooperation, and information access. However, investigating the relationship between social capital and congregational vitality and sustainability has not previously been possible due to data limitations. Purpose This article investigates the extent to which brokerage, or bridging together otherwise disconnected congregations, predicts congregational vitality and sustainability in an inter-congregational network of religious congregations from eight counties encompassing and surrounding a major metropolitan area in the southeastern United States. Research on social networks between organizations suggests that brokerage can have positive, negative, and curvilinear relationships with organizational outcomes, and this literature does not provide a clear expectation for how brokerage might relate with congregational vitality and sustainability. Methods OLS regressions are used to predict three forms of vitality and two forms of sustainability using inverse network constraint, a measure of brokerage, as well as a variety of control variables. Statistical significance is estimated through permutation tests, which account for the relationships between congregations. Results Results indicate that brokerage is positively associated with community vitality and that staff/volunteer sustainability is highest for congregations with moderate levels of brokerage. Brokerage does not predict spiritual vitality, relational vitality, or financial sustainability. Conclusions and Implications This article has practical implications for congregations. Bridging together otherwise disconnected congregations can provide a wide range of ideas, resources, and opportunities, and these benefits can help congregations seeking to minister in their communities. In addition, moderate levels of brokerage can provide more diverse information and resources as well as a supportive, trusting, and cooperative environment. This combination of benefits may be helpful for congregations to disclose challenges with and to seek resources related to staff/volunteer sustainability. In addition, this article contributes to the fields of: congregational studies through exploring predictors of congregational vitality and sustainability; sociology of religion through expanding research using social network analysis; inter-organizational networks, whose research on social capital and organizational outcomes is both complicated and conflicting.

<title>How intermittent breaks in interaction improve collective intelligence</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802407115</url>
<snippet>People influence each other when they interact to solve problems. Such social influence introduces both benefits (higher average solution quality due to exploitation of existing answers through social learning) and costs (lower maximum solution quality due to a reduction in individual exploration for novel answers) relative to independent problem solving. In contrast to prior work, which has focused on how the presence and network structure of social influence affect performance, here we investigate the effects of time. We show that when social influence is intermittent it provides the benefits of constant social influence without the costs. Human subjects solved the canonical traveling salesperson problem in groups of three, randomized into treatments with constant social influence, intermittent social influence, or no social influence. Groups in the intermittent social-influence treatment found the optimum solution frequently (like groups without influence) but had a high mean performance (like groups with constant influence); they learned from each other, while maintaining a high level of exploration. Solutions improved most on rounds with social influence after a period of separation. We also show that storing subjects' best solutions so that they could be reloaded and possibly modified in subsequent rounds-a ubiquitous feature of personal productivity software-is similar to constant social influence: It increases mean performance but decreases exploration.

<title>Effect of Dynamics of Social Network on Culture Formation driven by Adaptation to Environmental Conditions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>This paper presents an agent based model to simulate the process of formation of culture considering the adaptation to the environmental condition and discuss the effect of dynamic change of social network. In the presented model, agents learn the information provided from the environment and agents do not simply share the information that was hold by agents at the initial state. In the diffusion process of information, agents do not simply copy other agents' state variables, but share the target of learning, which is supposed to simulate "conditional learning". Network is supposed to be dynamic and links are rewired based on the homophily rule. Dynamic analysis of the model is supposed to show the co-evolution process of network and culture. Simulation results reveal that several groups of culture, which are corresponding to the environmental conditions, are formed when homophilic property of network dynamics is suppressed by constraint on the link rewiring, etc. These results indicate a new mechanism of formation of polarized cultural groups in the community, society and so forth.

<title>The Origins of Religious Homophily in a Medium and Large School</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13644-016-0266-1</url>
<snippet>How religion influences social interactions, and how social interactions influence religion, are fundamental questions to the sociology of religion. We address these processes and build on Cheadle and Schwadel's (Soc Sci Res 41: 1198-1212, 2012) analysis of selection and influence in religion-based social tie homogeneity (i.e. network-religion autocorrelation) in small schools by analyzing networks from larger schools, by focusing on differences across schools, and by testing different operationalizations of social influence. Using two waves of full network data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and dynamic longitudinal network SIENA models, we find (1) that both selection and influence impact network-religion autocorrelation; (2) that the factors influencing network-religion autocorrelation vary across school contexts; and (3) that religious influence is proportional to the number of friends in an adolescent's network, which means influence reflects both the size of an individual's network and the consistency of religion among members of the network. We conclude by addressing potential reasons for differences across school contexts and by discussing the theoretical logic behind the total similarity effect that best operationalized religious influence.

<title>A 'Different Class'? Homophily and Heterophily in the Social Class Networks of Britpop</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1749975517712045</url>
<snippet>Social network analysis is increasingly recognised as a useful way to explore music scenes. In this article we examine the individuals who were the cultural workforce that comprised the Britpop' music scene of the 1990s. The focus of our analysis is homophily and heterophily to determine whether the clusters of friendships and working relationships of those who were best connected' in the scene were patterned by original social class position. We find that Britpop's whole network' is heterophilic but that its sub-networks' are more likely to be social class homophilic. The sub-networks that remain heterophilic are likely to be united by other common experiences that brought individuals in the network to the same social spaces. We suggest that our findings on Britpop might be generalised to the composition of other music scenes, cultural workforces and aggregations of young people. Our study differs from research on, first, British indie music' and social class which focuses upon the construction, representation and performance of social location rather than the relationships it might shape and second, the pioneering social network analyses of music scenes which currently lack explicit emphasis on social class.

<snippet>Data collected from mobile phones have the potential to provide insight into the relational dynamics of individuals. This paper compares observational data from mobile phones with standard self-report survey data. We find that the information from these two data sources is overlapping but distinct. For example, self-reports of physical proximity deviate from mobile phone records depending on the recency and salience of the interactions. We also demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 95&#37; of friendships based on the observational data alone, where friend dyads demonstrate distinctive temporal and spatial patterns in their physical proximity and calling patterns. These behavioral patterns, in turn, allow the prediction of individual-level outcomes such as job satisfaction.

<title>Generalized key player problem</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-014-9175-4</url>
<snippet>The key player problem (KPP) identifies a set of key nodes that have a central role in a network. In this paper, we propose a generalized KPP (GKPP) that extends existing work on KPP-Pos and KPP-Neg in such a way that it can consider network structure, node attributes, and the characteristics of edges. We also articulate a novel concept called the key player problem for exclusion (KPP-E), which selects a set of nodes to enforce the centrality of a given set of nodes of interest. To solve this problem efficiently, we propose a sequential greedy algorithm that significantly reduces computational complexity. To corroborate the conceptual meaning and effectiveness of the proposed sequential greedy algorithm, we apply GKPP and KPP-E to several real and random networks.

<title>Application of network analysis and cluster analysis for better prevention and control of swine diseases in Argentina</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234489</url>
<snippet>Rationale/background Though much smaller than the bovine industry, the porcine sector in Argentina involves a large number of farms and represents a significant economic sector. In recent years Argentina has implemented a national registry of swine movements amongst other measures, in an effort to control and eventually eradicate endemic Aujesky's disease. Such information can prove valuable in assessing the risk of transmission between farms for endemic diseases but also for other diseases at risk of emergence. Methods Shipment data from 2011 to 2016 were analyzed in an effort to define strategic locations and times at which control and surveillance efforts should be focused to provide cost-effective interventions. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to characterize the network as a whole and at the individual farm and market level to help identify important nodes. Spatio-temporal trends of pig movements were also analyzed. Finally, in an attempt to classify farms and markets in different groups based on their SNA metrics, we used factor analysis for mixed data (FAMD) and hierarchical clustering. Results The network involved approximate 136,000 shipments for a total of 6 million pigs. Over 350 markets and 17,800 production units participated in shipments with another 83,500 not participating. Temporal data of shipments and network metrics showed peaks in shipments in September and October. Most shipments where within provinces, with Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe concentrating 61&#37; of shipments. Network analysis showed that markets are involved in relatively few shipments but hold strategic positions with much higher betweenness compared to farms. Hierarchical clustering yielded four groups based on SNA metrics and node characteristics which can be broadly described as: 1. small and backyard farms; 2. industrial farms; 3. markets; and 4. a single outlying market with extreme centrality values. Conclusion Characterizing the network structure and spatio-temporal characteristics of Argentine swine shipments provides valuable information that can guide targeted and more cost-effective surveillance and control programs. We located key nodes where efforts should be prioritized. Pig network characteristics and patterns can be used to create dynamic disease transmission models, which can both be used in assessing the impact of emerging diseases and guiding efforts to eradicate endemic ones.

<title>Information Spreading on Weighted Multiplex Social Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/5920187</url>
<snippet>Information spreading on multiplex networks has been investigated widely. For multiplex networks, the relations of each layer possess different extents of intimacy, which can be described as weighted multiplex networks. Nevertheless, the effect of weighted multiplex network structures on information spreading has not been analyzed comprehensively. We herein propose an information spreading model on a weighted multiplex network. Then, we develop an edge-weight-based compartmental theory to describe the spreading dynamics. We discover that under any adoption threshold of two subnetworks, reducing weight distribution heterogeneity does not alter the growth pattern of the final adoption size versus information transmission probability while accelerating information spreading. For fixed weight distribution, the growth pattern changes with the heterogeneous of degree distribution. There is a critical initial seed size, below which no global information outbreak can occur. Extensive numerical simulations affirm that the theoretical predictions agree well with the numerical results.

<title>On the Relation between the Small World Structure and Scientific Activities</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0121129</url>
<snippet>The modern science has become more complex and interdisciplinary in its nature which might encourage researchers to be more collaborative and get engaged in larger collaboration networks. Various aspects of collaboration networks have been examined so far to detect the most determinant factors in knowledge creation and scientific production. One of the network structures that recently attracted much theoretical attention is called small world. It has been suggested that small world can improve the information transmission among the network actors. In this paper, using the data on 12 periods of journal publications of Canadian researchers in natural sciences and engineering, the co-authorship networks of the researchers are created. Through measuring small world indicators, the small worldiness of the mentioned network and its relation with researchers' productivity, quality of their publications, and scientific team size are assessed. Our results show that the examined co-authorship network strictly exhibits the small world properties. In addition, it is suggested that in a small world network researchers expand their team size through getting connected to other experts of the field. This team size expansion may result in higher productivity of the whole team as a result of getting access to new resources, benefitting from the internal referring, and exchanging ideas among the team members. Moreover, although small world network is positively correlated with the quality of the articles in terms of both citation count and journal impact factor, it is negatively related with the average productivity of researchers in terms of the number of their publications.

<title>Effects of population dispersal on regional signaling networks: An example from northern Iroquoia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1700497</url>
<snippet>The dispersal of Iroquoian groups from St. Lawrence River valley during the 15th and 16th centuries A.D. has been a source of archaeological inquiry for decades. Social network analysis presented here indicates that sites from Jefferson County, New York at the head of the St. Lawrence River controlled interactions within regional social signaling networks during the 15th century A.D. Measures indicate that Jefferson County sites were in brokerage liaison positions between sites in New York and Ontario. In the network for the subsequent century, to which no Jefferson County sites are assigned, no single group took the place of Jefferson County in controlling network flow. The dispersal of Jefferson County populations effectively ended this brokerage function concomitant with the emergence of the nascent Huron-Wendat and Iroquois confederacies and may have contributed to the escalation of conflict between these entities. These results add to a growing literature on the use of network analyses with archaeological data and contribute new insights into processes of population relocation and geopolitical realignment, as well as the role of borderlands and frontiers in nonstate societies.

<title>Crisis Communications in the Age of Social Media: A Network Analysis of Zika-Related Tweets</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439317721985</url>
<snippet>While emerging technologies such as social media have demonstrated value for crisis communications, significant question remains regarding how these tools can be most effectively leveraged to facilitate the flow of valid information under crisis conditions. In an effort to address these issues, this article examines the use of Twitter during the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak in the United States. Particular attention is paid to network structures within the Zika conversation and how different actors and communities contribute to the flow of information throughout the broader Twitter community. Public-facing organizations can benefit from a deeper understanding of the nature and structure of spontaneously occurring communities on social media as well as the types of content that they create and circulate. As such, these findings have significant implications for the development of effective social media strategies during natural disasters and public health emergencies. In particular, this analysis identifies several predominant themes communicated through Zika-related tweets as well as a number of distinct communities and influential actors. The findings suggest that respected political actors, public institutions, as well as those with valid scientific credentials can help to facilitate the flow of accurate and vital information across disparate communities.

<title>How does socioeconomic homophily emerge? Testing for the contribution of different processes to socioeconomic segregation in adolescent friendships</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.09.002</url>
<snippet>Homophily - the fact that friendships happen at a higher rate among similar individuals - does not necessarily imply homophilic selection - the tendency to look for similar friends. This is particularly true for socioeconomic homophily: because individuals' social class impacts most aspects of their lives, there are several ways in which it can favor homogeneity in friendship networks. Applying this view to the relationships of French middle-school students, the present article tries to unravel the contribution of various relational processes to the emergence of socioeconomic homophily. Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models, a class of generative models designed for network panel data, are applied to the friendship networks of 820 students surveyed over a year and a half. Simulations derived from the estimated models are then used to assess the impact of different processes on aggregated levels of homophily. To that aim, a new metric is proposed that help researchers decompose an observed property of a network into a set of contributions from low-order processes, called "contribution scores". Results suggest that direct homophilic selection can be important in explaining socioeconomic homophily, but not in all cases. Indirect inducers, such as residential propinquity or ethnic selection, also play a significant role. Moreover, endogenous network processes - namely reciprocation and transitive closure - strongly contribute to homophily by reinforcing other homophily-inducing processes.

<title>Cultural identity change in expatriates: A social network perspective</title>

<snippet>We explore relational patterns of expatriates' social networks and their impact on expatriates' change in cultural identity while working abroad. We go beyond mono-cultural assumptions and highlight the importance of examining cross-cultural relational dynamics on maintenance and change in expatriates' cultural identity. We argue that strong ties in dense networks are most conducive to helping expatriates stay attached to a national culture. Cultural diversity in a social network provides the impetus for cultural identity change. Cross-cultural interconnectedness within an expatriate's social network contributes to the development of multiculturalism in one's cultural identity. We also discuss the effect of cultural identity change on expatriation and repatriation adjustment, and provide some practical implications for individuals as well as organizations. Overall, we offer a cross-cultural social network perspective in theorizing about the expatriation experience.

<snippet>Social capital theory assumes that information is valuable. However, only rarely is this value explicitly modeled, and there are few examples of empirical tests of mechanisms that connect social network structure to valuable information. We model an individual decision problem in which individuals make choices that yield uncertain outcomes. The individuals can learn about the profitability of options from their own choices and from the network. We generate computer-simulated data to derive hypotheses about the effect of network characteristics on making profitable choices. We conduct a laboratory experiment to empirically test these hypotheses and find that, at the individual level, degree centrality has a positive effect on making profitable choices whereas betweenness centrality has no effect. At the network level, density has a positive effect on making profitable choices, whereas centralization does not have an effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2024.2319602</url>
<snippet>The overall synergy of technical-link-based cooperative innovation has the potential to drive industrial competitiveness, yet there is a gap in the knowledge of the cooperative innovation subnetworks based on various key technical links in a modular manufacturing industry. This study scrutinised the structure and coordination of three key technical-link-based subnetworks in the Chinese NEV industry by an empirical analysis based on joint patent data from 2009 to 2019 and a composite coordination measurement model. The findings indicate that the cooperative relationship within the three sub-networks all become closer to the obvious 'core-periphery' structure since 2016, with a downward trend in network density. The coordination of the three subnetworks has gradually changed from an uncoordinated degree to a low-coordinated degree, and the battery technology subnetwork has a generally lower-order degree. Some suggestions for improving the overall coordination are provided. Our study contributes to a better understanding of cooperation network dynamics with a lens of improving the balance in structural properties from technical-link-based subnetworks in a modular manufacturing industry.

<title>Alliance-building for equity and justice: An inter-organizational perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2023.102382</url>
<snippet>Cultivating alliances between specific sectors or fields with unrealized synergies is a promising strategy for systems change. Social network analysis is a useful tool for assessing whether such alliances build relationships between these previously disparate organizations. Two waves of valued network data were collected from the members (N = 25) of a justice system reform coalition composed of two types of community-based organizations: those involved in restorative justice practice and those involved in grassroots community organizing. Social network homophily analyses were employed to characterize the impact of alliance participation on relationships over time across three domains: working together, doing impactful work together, and sharing a philosophy about justice system reform. Results indicate marked increases in the prevalence of relationships between restorative justice and community organizing organizations across all domains, with the greatest increases occurring in perceptions of shared philosophy. Network structures at each time point differed by relational domain and organization type. Findings suggest that the alliance strengthened relationships between restorative justice and community organizing organizations, particularly in perceptions of shared philosophy, but that the magnitude of these changes varied depending on pre-existing interorganizational relationships and organization type. Findings challenge the idea that close working relationships between diverse members is critical to coalition effectiveness, pointing instead to the value of ambidextrous networks and alignment in members' philosophy and vision.

<title>The Effect of Gossip on Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cplx.20334</url>
<snippet>In this article, we develop a simple model for the effect of gossip spread on social network structure. We define gossip as information passed between two individuals A and B about a third individual C which affects the strengths of all three relationships: it strengthens A-B and weakens both B-C and A-C. We find, in both an analytic derivation and model simulations, that if gossip does not spread beyond simple triads, it destroys them but if gossip propagates through large dense clusters, it strengthens them. Additionally, our simulations show that the effect of gossip on network metrics (clustering coefficient, average-path-length, and sum-of-strengths) varies with network structure and average-node-degree.

<title>The role of tie strength in assessing credibility of scientific content on facebook</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101261</url>
<snippet>Social networking sites have become a major venue for dissemination of- and discussions about science-related topics. On these platforms, message credibility assessment takes into account not only traditional cues (like scientific arguments and information source), but also new types of social cues. Of the latter, we focus on tie strength, a central component of social networking sites, which has an important role in information flow, and the role of which in the process of message credibility assessment has been so far overlooked. We also consider two important and relevant meta-cognitive measures: need for cognition and expertise perception. Applying an experimental design in Facebook (N = 324), our findings suggest that need for cognition weakens the positive associations between tie strength and perceived message credibility. Also, both expertise perception and tie strength have positive effect on perceived message credibility.

<title>Polyamory in Paris: A social network theory application</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1363460720975328</url>
<snippet>Multiple sexual partnerships can be viewed as networks in order to assess the nature of links between lovers and metamours (lover's lovers) as well as the larger population. In such non-monogamous networks, where participants share sex, friendship, ideas, and economic resources, there exists a vast web of nodes connected in much more intimate and complex ways than one finds in the mono-normative landscape. This study explored gender dynamics in network centrality on a sample of 62 polyamorists in Paris, France using participant-observation, informal and structured interviews, and social network analysis. Though evolutionary psychology and pornographic film tend to reinforce heteronormative stereotypes of males as central social actors with multiple sexual partners and women as sexually passive, feminist theorists have argued for a more "agentic female sexual subjectivity". My data showed that cis- and trans-women, with a strong sense of family and skills in interpersonal communication, score highest on network metrics of density/degree, homophily, indirectedness, and transitivity. The network data also indicate high modularity and endogamy with clustering tendencies for both cis-men and cis- and trans-women linked to kink, atypical intelligence, sexual and gender non-conformity, and mitigating factors of socioeconomic advantage and racial privilege.

<title>A multilevel network study of the effects of delinquent behavior on friendship evolution</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222500305892</url>
<snippet>A multilevel approach is proposed to the study of the evolution of multiple networks. In this approach, the basic evolution process is assumed to be the same, while parameter values may differ between different networks. For the network evolution process, stochastic actor-oriented models are used, of which the parameters are estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. This is applied to the study of effects of delinquent behavior on friendship formation, a question of long standing in criminology. The evolution of friendship is studied empirically in 19 school classes. It is concluded that there is evidence for an effect of similarity in delinquent behavior on friendship evolution. Similarity of the degree of delinquent behavior has a positive effect on tie formation but also on tie dissolution. The last result seems to contradict current criminological theories, and deserves further study.

<title>Social capital I: measurement and associations with economic mobility</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04996-4</url>
<snippet>Social capital-the strength of an individual's social network and community-has been identified as a potential determinant of outcomes ranging from education to health(1-8). However, efforts to understand what types of social capital matter for these outcomes have been hindered by a lack of social network data. Here, in the first of a pair of papers(9), we use data on 21 billion friendships from Facebook to study social capital. We measure and analyse three types of social capital by ZIP (postal) code in the United States: (1) connectedness between different types of people, such as those with low versus high socioeconomic status (SES); (2) social cohesion, such as the extent of cliques in friendship networks; and (3) civic engagement, such as rates of volunteering. These measures vary substantially across areas, but are not highly correlated with each other. We demonstrate the importance of distinguishing these forms of social capital by analysing their associations with economic mobility across areas. The share of high-SES friends among individuals with low SES-which we term economic connectedness-is among the strongest predictors of upward income mobility identified to date(10,11). Other social capital measures are not strongly associated with economic mobility. If children with low-SES parents were to grow up in counties with economic connectedness comparable to that of the average child with high-SES parents, their incomes in adulthood would increase by 20&#37; on average. Differences in economic connectedness can explain well-known relationships between upward income mobility and racial segregation, poverty rates, and inequality(12-14). To support further research and policy interventions, we publicly release privacy-protected statistics on social capital by ZIP code at https://www.socialcapital.org.

<title>Significant Communities in Large Sparse Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0033721</url>
<snippet>Researchers use community-detection algorithms to reveal large-scale organization in biological and social networks, but community detection is useful only if the communities are significant and not a result of noisy data. To assess the statistical significance of the network communities, or the robustness of the detected structure, one approach is to perturb the network structure by removing links and measure how much the communities change. However, perturbing sparse networks is challenging because they are inherently sensitive; they shatter easily if links are removed. Here we propose a simple method to perturb sparse networks and assess the significance of their communities. We generate resampled networks by adding extra links based on local information, then we aggregate the information from multiple resampled networks to find a coarse-grained description of significant clusters. In addition to testing our method on benchmark networks, we use our method on the sparse network of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) case law, to detect significant and insignificant areas of law. We use our significance analysis to draw a map of the ECJ case law network that reveals the relations between the areas of law.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08898480.2017.1348718</url>
<snippet>The obesity pandemic is represented by a discrete-time Hopfield Boolean network embedded in continuous-time population dynamics. The influence of the social environment passes through a system of differential equations, whereby obesity spreads by imitation of the most influential neighbors, those who have the highest centrality indices in the network. This property is called homophily. Susceptibility and frailty are redefined using network properties. Projections of the spread of obesity are validated on data collected in a French high school.

<title>Measuring web ecology by Facebook, Twitter, blogs and online news: 2012 general election in South Korea</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-014-0016-9</url>
<snippet>This study aimed to provide an empirical and analytical account of online information flow and web ecology in four platforms around the 2012 general election in South Korea. The study quantitatively examined the interrelationship of web ecology among relevant platforms-including online news, blogs, Twitter and Facebook-during election campaigns. In order to quantify the current political situations, this study employed network analysis and the model fitting method with co-occurrence web visibility data of political parties and their leaders in four platforms. The findings demonstrated to what extent web ecologies on four different online platforms during the given election reflect the country's political situation. Comparing network centralizations across platforms, results showed that online news was the least biased media and Twitter was the most biased with the highest centralization scores. Although both the ruling party and the major opposition party-including the leaders of those two parties-had higher degree centrality scores than minor parties and their leaders in all platforms, some distinct features were observed in Twitter and Facebook due to their attributes. In addition, regressions and their residuals confirmed that web ecologies in four platforms, in terms of degree centrality, had been linearly expanded over time and showed their individual characteristics.

<title>Mapping movements: a call for qualitative social network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1468794120927678</url>
<snippet>Social network analysis (SNA) is an interdisciplinary method that takes as its starting point the premise that social life is created primarily and most importantly by relations and the patterns formed by these relations. While SNA is often associated with the quantitative analysis of network measures, we illustrate through our overall mapping of, and interpretation of the relations within the Denver food movement, the advantages of a qualitative approach. We bring together information from surveys, network diagrams, betweenness centrality measures, and interviews to offer an interpretive process that reveals both the structure and activist- and organization-level meanings to explain resource mobilization and collaboration. We propose that qualitative SNA allows researchers to (a) understand the context and content of network structures and (b) better interpret quantitative measures with additional qualitative data. Based on our findings, we additionally suggest that for social movement scholars, qualitative SNA offers a deeper understanding of how organizations collaborate to advance organizational and movement goals.

<title>A Theoretical Examination of Homophily Beyond Focus Theory: Causes, Consequences, and New Directions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440231173915</url>
<snippet>Scott Feld's focus theory stimulated one of the most important traditions in the study of the concept of homophily in connection to individual action and network behavior across sociology and organizational studies. This article uses Feld's focus theory as a starting point of reference to examine the major theoretical developments and empirical applications of homophily since his pioneering work. First, this article interrogates the causes of homophily by examining structured versus social psychological preference for similarity as two prominent explanatory mechanisms for homophily. Second, this article scopes out the consequences of homophily by examining the advantages and disadvantages of homophily for individual action and network behavior. Finally, building on the previous sections, this article proposes new areas for the study of homophily: deleterious psychosocial consequences of homophily, the role of multiplexity in causing homophily, and the disaggregation of homophily in general into different, nuanced (potentially interacting) types of homophily. This article thus contributes to the literature by offering a critical juncture to examine the key arguments that have guided the study of homophily since Feld's focus theory and an important launching point for future research on the concept of homophily and its applications.

<title>Age integration in the social convoys of young and late midlife adults</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2023.100540</url>
<snippet>Homophily on the basis of age is a notable characteristic of social convoys across the life course. Ties to older and younger persons, therefore, are both unusual and potentially provide unique social support resources. This study examined relationships with older, younger, and same-aged non-kin ties among young and late midlife adults. Data came from the University of California Berkeley Social Networks Study (UCNets), a sample of 485 people aged 21-30 and 674 people aged 50-70. A majority of non-kin ties were to people whose age was within 5 years of the participant's own age, although the majority was much larger for young adults (81 &#37;) than late midlife adults (52 &#37;). Younger and older ties often came from different social settings (school, work, religious organi-zations, and neighborhoods) than same-aged ties, and there were also some cohort differences in the social settings that produced younger, older, and same-aged ties. Younger and older ties also provided different forms of social support than did ties to same-aged persons. Again, the functions of younger and older ties varied by cohort. Implications for life course studies are discussed.

<title>Confirmation bias in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2023.02.007</url>
<snippet>In this study, I present a theoretical social learning model to investigate how confirmation bias affects opinions when agents exchange information over a social network. Hence, besides exchanging opinions with friends, agents observe a public sequence of potentially ambiguous signals and interpret it according to a rule that includes confirmation bias. First, this study shows that regardless of level of ambiguity both for people or networked society, only two types of opinions can be formed, and both are biased. However, one opinion type is less biased than the other depending on the state of the world. The size of both biases depends on the ambiguity level and relative magnitude of the state and confirmation biases. Hence, long-run learning is not attained even when people impartially interpret ambiguity. Finally, analytically confirming the probability of emergence of the less-biased consensus when people are connected and have different priors is difficult. Hence, I used simulations to analyze its determinants and found three main results: (i) some network topologies are more conducive to consensus efficiency, (ii) some degree of partisanship enhances consensus efficiency even under confirmation bias and (iii) open-mindedness (i.e. when partisans agree to exchange opinions with opposing partisans) might inhibit efficiency in some cases.

<title>Producing public goods in networks: Some effects of social comparison and endogenous network change</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2012.05.003</url>
<snippet>As actors participate in the production of public goods, processes of social comparison may affect the decisions about the individual contributions as well as the endogenously changing structure of an underlying social network. This leads to the transformation of an ordinary n-player Prisoner's Dilemma of collective action into an n-player coordination game. The paper uses agent-based simulations to trace the formation of public goods while varying network characteristics, such as density, segregation, or the strength of relationships. Additionally, the usage of both a forward- and a backward-looking agent model shows possible implications of different assumptions about the actors' decision making. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

<title>No evidence for a relationship between social closeness and similarity in resting-state functional brain connectivity in schoolchildren</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-67718-8</url>
<snippet>Previous research suggests that the proximity of individuals in a social network predicts how similarly their brains respond to naturalistic stimuli. However, the relationship between social connectedness and brain connectivity in the absence of external stimuli has not been examined. To investigate whether neural homophily between friends exists at rest we collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 68 school-aged girls, along with social network information from all pupils in their year groups (total 5,066 social dyads). Participants were asked to rate the amount of time they voluntarily spent with each person in their year group, and directed social network matrices and community structure were then determined from these data. No statistically significant relationships between social distance, community homogeneity and similarity of global-level resting-state connectivity were observed. Nor were we able to predict social distance using a regularised regression technique (i.e. elastic net regression based on the local-level similarities in resting-state whole-brain connectivity between participants). Although neural homophily between friends exists when viewing naturalistic stimuli, this finding did not extend to functional connectivity at rest in our population. Instead, resting-state connectivity may be less susceptible to the influences of a person's social environment.

<title>Stability and dynamics of communities on online question-answer sites</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.12.004</url>
<snippet>Social networks are present in our everyday lives, not just in face to face communication, but also when we communicate through the Internet. The latter leaves massive traces of data and thereby opens opportunities to acquire a better understanding of social communities in general. In this work, we are particularly interested in the patterns of volunteer efforts within the communities. To that end, we examine the community structure of several large online question-answer sites and how they evolve over time. To describe the user interaction patterns concisely, we employ the hyperbolic community model. This statistical model allows for a summary of each community in each time step by means of intuitive parameters that reflect the connectivity pattern within the network. Our study of the temporal evolution of these parameters reveals an important characteristic: In contrast to what has been observed earlier in the analyses of growth behaviour of online communities, we observe that the user activity within a community is constant with respect to its size throughout its lifetime. Furthermore, the structural organisation of different communities across different question-answer sites seems to follow a common scheme: There is a small group of users who is responsible for the majority of the social interactions.

<title>Messy Arrangements? A Social Networks Perspective on Migrant Labor Brokerage: The Case of Ukrainian Migration to Poland</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.26412/psr220.03</url>
<snippet>This article draws on two studies conducted between 2016 and 2018 on the nature of labor migration from Ukraine to Poland. Using quantitative and qualitative data, it analyses the relationship between social networks and employment agencies. Building on research into migration infrastructure, we question the dichotomy-which also appears in migrants' narratives-between migrant social networks and labor brokers, and offer evidence of overlap and interdependence between the two. Exploring various aspects of labor migration, we look at the role played by the social networks of the actors (both the migrants and the intermediaries) in enhancing migration infrastructure. We show how migrants use their social capital in regard to labor brokers and how the latter, rather than replacing networks, mobilize their network resources and experience to create a trusted transnational service.

<title>Who Talks Religion and What Are the Consequences for Social Ties? Unpacking a Sensitive Discussion Topic in Close Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/socrel/srx069</url>
<snippet>Though religion matters greatly to many U.S. adults, it is widely considered a touchy conversational topic. Understanding how religious issues are talked about with others can elucidate a key interpersonal manifestation of Americans' faith, yet existing research has largely overlooked the phenomena of religious discussion in social networks. This article considers which types of people talk about religion with their close ties, what relational factors underlie religious discussion, and what implications such discussion has for network turnover and stability. Applying multilevel regression methods to ego-centered networks measured in the Portraits of American Life Survey, I find that individual-and relational-level factors each predict the presence of religious discussion within close networks. Longitudinal analyses further reveal that for a large subset of Americans-namely evangelical and mainline Protestants and those involved in a congregation-religious discussion partners are especially likely to remain in the network over the course of 6 years. This association extended beyond other factors that could explain tie persistence, including relational closeness and multiple forms of homophily. Results point to several promising future directions for the study of religion and social networks.

<title>Social networks are shaped by culturally contingent assessments of social competence</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34723-6</url>
<snippet>Cultural outsiders, like immigrants or international students, often struggle to make friends. We propose that one barrier to social connection is not knowing what it means to be socially competent in the host culture. First-year students at a U.S. business school (N = 1328) completed a social network survey and rated their own social competence and that of several peers. International students were rated by peers as less socially competent than U.S. students, especially if they were from nations more culturally dissimilar to the U.S. International students' self-reported competence ratings were uncorrelated with peers' judgments. Social network analysis revealed international students were less central to their peer networks than U.S. students, although this gap was reduced if peers evaluated them as socially competent. Peer-reported competence mediated the effects of international student status on social network centrality. Since learning local norms takes time, we suggest inclusivity will require host communities to define social competence more broadly.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254424</url>
<snippet>This study aims to understand the nature of information and communication technology in technology convergence. We form a knowledge network by applying social network theories to Korean patent data collected from the European Patent Organization. A knowledge network consists of nodes representing technology sectors identified by their International Patent Classification codes and edges that link International Patent Classification codes when they appear concurrently in a patent. We test the proposed hypotheses using four indices (degree centrality, E-I index, entropy index, and clustering coefficient). The results show that information and communication technology is easily attached but tends to converge with similar technology and has the greatest influence on technology convergence over other technologies. This study is expected to help practitioners and policymakers understand the structure and interaction mechanisms of technology from a systematic perspective and improve national-level technology policies.

<title>Identifying and quantifying potential super-spreaders in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51153-5</url>
<snippet>Quantifying the nodal spreading abilities and identifying the potential influential spreaders has been one of the most engaging topics recently, which is essential and beneficial to facilitate information flow and ensure the stabilization operations of social networks. However, most of the existing algorithms just consider a fundamental quantification through combining a certain attribute of the nodes to measure the nodes' importance. Moreover, reaching a balance between the accuracy and the simplicity of these algorithms is difficult. In order to accurately identify the potential super-spreaders, the CumulativeRank algorithm is proposed in the present study. This algorithm combines the local and global performances of nodes for measuring the nodal spreading abilities. In local performances, the proposed algorithm considers both the direct influence from the node's neighbourhoods and the indirect influence from the nearest and the next nearest neighbours. On the other hand, in the global performances, the concept of the tenacity is introduced to assess the node's prominent position in maintaining the network connectivity. Extensive experiments carried out with the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model on real-world social networks demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the comparison of the proposed algorithm with the existing well-known algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm has lower time complexity and can be applicable to large-scale networks.

<title>The use of sparsest cuts to reveal the hierarchical community structure of social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2008.03.004</url>
<snippet>We show that good community structures can be obtained by partitioning a social network in a succession of divisive sparsest cuts. A network flow algorithm based on fundamental principles of graph theory is introduced to identify the sparsest cuts and an underlying hierarchical community structure of the network via maximum concurrent flow. Matula [Matula, David W., 1985. Concurrent flow and concurrent connectivity in graphs. In: Alavi, Y., et al. (Eds.), Graph Theory and its Applications to Algorithms and Computer Science. Wiley, New York, NY, pp. 543-559.] established the maximum concurrent flow problem (MCFP), and papers, on divisive vs. agglomerative average-linkage hierarchical clustering [e.g., Matula, David W., 1983. Cluster validity by concurrent chaining. In: Felsenstein, J. (Ed.), Numerical Taxonomy: Proc. of the NATO Adv. Study Inst., vol. 1.

A flow rerouting algorithm for the maximum concurrent flow problem with variable capacities and demands, and its application to cluster analysis. MasterThesis. School of Engineering and Applied Science, Southern Methodist University] provide the basis for partitioning a social network by way of sparsest cuts and/or maximum concurrent flow. The MCFP extends the [Ford Jr., Lester R., Fulkerson, Delbert R., 1956. Maximal flow through a network. Canadian journal of Mathematics 8, 399-404; Ford Jr., Lester R., Fulkerson, Delbert R., 1962. Flows in Networks. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ] source-sink max-flow problem to all-pairs maximum concurrent flow. The density of an (S, T)-cut is vertical bar(S, T)\(vertical bar S vertical bar center dot vertical bar T vertical bar) where vertical bar(S, T)vertical bar is the number of edges (equivalently, links or bonds) between communities S and T with vertical bar S vertical bar center dot vertical bar T vertical bar being the maximum number of edges possible. The minimum density cut in the network is the sparsest cut. When the edges are weighted, the density is the average weight of the (S, T)-cut edges, with absent edges treated as edges of zero weight. Sparsest cuts (i.e., minimum density) of the remaining components are iteratively determined via linear programming until a multipartite cut is identified that is more constraining to concurrent flow than any sparsest cut. Empirical results on real-world networks with known hierarchical structures and random networks with embedded communities are used to compare this sparsest-cut community structure criterion to the weighted Girvan-Newman community structure criterion [e.g., Newman, M.E.J., 2004. Analysis of weighted networks.. Physical Review E 70, 056131] that is based on edge betweenness centrality. A new measure of accuracy M is defined to evaluate the results of the graph partitionings found by these criteria.

<snippet>This article contends that the problem of classroom order rests less in the roles and compositions of classrooms than in the multidimensional nature of their social situations. Classroom order arises from the dynamic relationship between distinct situational requirements: the coordination of interaction into institutionalized patterns (routine) and the validation of participants' identities (ritual). Utilizing a unique data set of more than 800,000 turns of talk from 601 high school classrooms, the authors develop metrics for measuring the longitudinal accomplishment of routine (interactional stability) and ritual (interactional concord) and present two sets of analyses. The first analyses identify the antecedents to stability and concord, and the second examine how stability and concord shape the experiences and attitudes of classroom participants. Results indicate that activities and discourse combine to fulfill the requirements of ritual and routine in different ways, often meeting one at the expense of the other, and that the accomplishment of stability and concord has positive returns to classroom experiences, but in different ways for teachers and students.

<title>Cooperation evaluation with the use of network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2018.07.005</url>
<snippet>The aim of the paper is to propose a way of assessing tourist partnerships using Social Network Analysis (SNA). The partnership structure chosen for this assessment was the `Wisla Tourist Organization' (WTO) - a Destination Marketing Organization operating in the south of Poland. Collaboration assessment was based on discovering if, and to what extent new types of relationships between WTO members exist - and how big a part of the network structure they cover. It was assumed that the higher the extent of partnership relations in the WTO based on direct relations between WTO's members including: business cooperation, communication, knowledge, trust, mutual understanding, dialogue, benefits from cooperation, and perceived fulfilled expectations, the higher the level of collaboration evaluation.

<title>Diffusion in small worlds with homophily and social reinforcement: A theoretical model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.05.004</url>
<snippet>We introduce homophily in a percolation model of word-of-mouth diffusion in social networks by reorganizing the nodes according to similarity in preferences for adoption of an innovation. Such preferences are described by a "minimum utility requirement"for an agent to adopt. We show that homophily removes the non-linear relation between preferences and diffusion in the standard percolation model with a high diffusion regime ("hit") and a low diffusion regime ("flop"). Instead, in a model with perfect homophily, the final diffusion scales linearly with individual preferences: all agents who are willing to adopt, do adopt the innovation. We also investigate the combined effect of homophily and social reinforcement in diffusion. Results indicate that social reinforcement renders clustered networks more efficient in terms of diffusion size for network with strong homophily, while the opposite is true for networks without homophily. The simple structure of our model allows to disentangle the effect of social influence, homophily and the network structure on diffusion. However, the controllability of the theoretical structure comes at the expenses of the realism of the model. For this, we discuss possible extensions and empirical applications.

<title>World Environment Day: Understanding Environmental Programs Impact on Society Using Twitter Data Mining</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-022-02957-y</url>
<snippet>Environmental sustainability awareness has encouraged the promotion of a number of environmental programs and initiatives and, accordingly, the use of social networks for the dissemination and support of these initiatives has grown significantly. Thus, the purpose of the work is to understand United Nations World Environment Day (WED) programs impact on the digital public debate using Twitter data mining. For that, an ad hoc methodology is designed to provide it to authorities and organizations that wish to analyze the impact of different initiatives or programs on society. All in all, the research carried out analyzes more than 400,000 tweets sent during the 2021 edition of the WED. The tweets have been processed using Big Data techniques and Social Network Analysis. The research reveals that the WED was a trending topic initiative that was discussed in positive terms, where collective sentiment was shown. The topics covered dealt with the event day and the different initiatives related to restoration of ecosystems. However, it is noted that: there is no coordinated action by the institutions, groups or individuals involved in the conversation and the initiative tends towards homophily; digital mobilization is mostly centered in the host country (Pakistan) and, above all, in the neighboring country (India) and, the conspicuous absence of the business sphere in the discussion.

<title>Bootstrap percolation on spatial networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep14662</url>
<snippet>Bootstrap percolation is a general representation of some networked activation process, which has found applications in explaining many important social phenomena, such as the propagation of information. Inspired by some recent findings on spatial structure of online social networks, here we study bootstrap percolation on undirected spatial networks, with the probability density function of long-range links' lengths being a power law with tunable exponent. Setting the size of the giant active component as the order parameter, we find a parameter-dependent critical value for the power-law exponent, above which there is a double phase transition, mixed of a second-order phase transition and a hybrid phase transition with two varying critical points, otherwise there is only a second-order phase transition. We further find a parameter-independent critical value around -1, about which the two critical points for the double phase transition are almost constant. To our surprise, this critical value -1 is just equal or very close to the values of many real online social networks, including LiveJournal, HP Labs email network, Belgian mobile phone network, etc. This work helps us in better understanding the self-organization of spatial structure of online social networks, in terms of the effective function for information spreading.

<title>Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0730888413505229</url>
<snippet>The last two decades of research and policy discussion have illuminated important changes in both the opportunities and challenges facing artists and artistic workers as they pursue their careers and advance their artistry. The authors argue that artists need to be masters of navigating across historically disparate domains, for example, specialization and generalist skills, autonomy and social engagement, the economy's periphery and the core, precarious employment and self-directed entrepreneurialism, and large metro centers and regional art markets. In addition, artists both work beyond existing markets and create entirely new opportunities for themselves and others. As catalysts of change and innovation, artistic workers face special challenges managing ambiguity, developing and sustaining a creative identity, and forming community in the context of an individually based enterprise economy.

<title>Using Radical Environmentalist Texts to Uncover Network Structure and Network Features</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0049124117729696</url>
<snippet>Radical social movements are broadly engaged in, and dedicated to, promoting change in their social environment. In their corresponding efforts to call attention to various causes, communicate with like-minded groups, and mobilize support for their activities, radical social movements also produce an enormous amount of text. These texts, like radical social movements themselves, are often (i) densely connected and (ii) highly variable in advocated protest activities. Given a corpus of radical social movement texts, can one uncover the underlying network structure of the radical activist groups involved in this movement? If so, can one then also identify which groups (and which subnetworks) are more prone to radical versus mainstream protest activities? Using a large corpus of British radical environmentalist texts (1992-2003), we seek to answer these questions through a novel integration of network discovery and unsupervised topic modeling. In doing so, we apply classic network descriptives (e.g., centrality measures) and more modern statistical models (e.g., exponential random graph models) to carefully parse apart these questions. Our findings provide a number of revealing insights into the networks and nature of radical environmentalists and their texts.

<title>Lay theories of networking ability: Beliefs that inhibit instrumental networking</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2020.01.003</url>
<snippet>While touting the importance of building effective networks, scholars have paid far less attention to why so many people feel so ambivalent or conflicted about instrumental networking, and what can be done to change such attitudes. The present research provides the first empirical test of a novel theory, which argues that people are more likely to disengage from networking if they hold a "fixed theory" of networking ability-believing that how well one networks is fixed or innate rather than learned through effort-which triggers negative attitudes toward moral and instrumental aspects of networking. To test this argument, we first develop and validate a Lay Theory of Networking Ability scale (Study 1) and show that this scale predicts people's attendance in networking events over a 6-week period (Study 2). Next, we show that lay theories can be experimentally manipulated, with consequences for attendance in networking events over a 4-week period (Study 3) as well as people's affective experiences in networking events (Study 4). In all, the present research contributes to our understanding of the motivational psychology of networking by highlighting the importance of beliefs as an understudied construct in the networks literature and by introducing methods to measure and manipulate them.

<title>Financial and digital financial literacy through social media use towards financial inclusion among batik small enterprises in Indonesia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34902</url>
<snippet>Batik, an Indonesian textile art form, holds immense economic and cultural importance. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) specialising in batik play a crucial role in Indonesia's economic growth and cultural preservation, contributing significantly to the gross domestic product (GDP) and preserving the nation's heritage. Nevertheless, these enterprises face several challenges, such as slow growth and limited access to credit. The batik industry also lags in financial literacy and the adoption of digital marketing strategies, hindering its development. This quantitative study aims to investigate the relationship between financial literacy, digital financial literacy, and financial inclusion in batik SMEs and also examined the moderating effect of online social networks. A survey was conducted involving 535 managers, owners, and financial officers of small batik enterprises. Subsequently, the SmartPLS statistical analysis method was employed for data analysis. The results demonstrate that financial literacy and digital financial literacy play a significant role in accessing financial inclusion for batik small enterprises. Moreover, the utilisation of social media was found to moderate these relationships, amplifying the impact of financial and digital literacy on financial inclusion. The findings contribute to the existing knowledge, provide insights for enhancing batik small enterprises, and propose a digital financial model to promote financial inclusion.

<title>MOVING BEYOND FACTIONS: USING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TO UNCOVER PATRONAGE NETWORKS AMONG CHINESE ELITES</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jea.2015.3</url>
<snippet>Informal connections play an important role in regimes all across the world, but among China's political elite, it is particularly factional affiliation that is said to structure contention over who will rule and who will fall victim to a purge. This article identifies two approaches to measuring factional ties in the literature: the exploratory approach traces alliance ties through qualitative assessment of insider sources, while the structured approach uses publicly available data to infer factions from shared characteristics. The article combines the two by arguing that informal politics is better conceptualized as a process of alliance formation shaped by an underlying social (network) structure. Among the structured approaches, coworker networks best capture the latter, but this can be further refined by noting the number of instances of working together, or by taking into account promotions that have occurred while the two individuals were coworkers.

<title>Detailed temporal structure of communication networks in groups of songbirds</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2016.0296</url>
<snippet>Animals in groups often exchange calls, in patterns whose temporal structure may be influenced by contextual factors such as physical location and the social network structure of the group. We introduce a model-based analysis for temporal patterns of animal call timing, originally developed for networks of firing neurons. This has advantages over cross-correlation analysis in that it can correctly handle common-cause confounds and provides a generative model of call patterns with explicit parameters for the influences between individuals. It also has advantages over standard Markovian analysis in that it incorporates detailed temporal interactions which affect timing as well as sequencing of calls. Further, a fitted model can be used to generate novel synthetic call sequences. We apply the method to calls recorded from groups of domesticated zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) individuals. We find that the communication network in these groups has stable structure that persists from one day to the next, and that 'kernels' reflecting the temporal range of influence have a characteristic structure for a calling individual's effect on itself, its partner and on others in the group. We further find characteristic patterns of influences by call type as well as by individual.

<snippet>In this paper we investigate shifts in Twitter network topology resulting from the type of information being shared. We identified communities matching areas of agricultural expertise and measured the core-periphery centralization of network formations resulting from users sharing generic versus specialized information. We found that centralization increases when specialized information is shared and that the network adopts decentralized formations as conversations become more generic. The results are consistent with classical diffusion models positing that specialized information comes with greater centralization, but they also show that users favor decentralized formations, which can foster community cohesion, when spreading specialized information is secondary.

<title>Effect of Overconfidence on Product Diffusion in Online Social Networks: A Multiagent Simulation Based on Evolutionary Game and Overconfidence Theory</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/1516419</url>
<snippet>The rapid development of online social media has significantly promoted product diffusion in online social networks (PDOSN). However, prior studies focusing on irrational behavior, such as overconfidence, in PDOSN are scarce. To investigate the effect of overconfidence on PDOSN, this study combined overconfidence and an evolutionary game to conduct a multiagent simulation on PDOSN. This combined method provided an effective reference to examine product diffusion in the context of irrational behavior. After careful consideration, this study identified three overconfidence scenarios, benefit, cost, and benefit and cost overconfidence, developed a multiagent simulation model for PDOSN using various overconfidence scenarios, and conducted a comparison with real-world cases to validate the model's feasibility. The findings indicated that adoption benefits and betrayal penalties had a positive effect on the results in all models, while adoption costs had the opposite effect. When benefit and cost overconfidence occurred simultaneously, benefit overconfidence offset the negative effect of cost overconfidence. Moderate connectivity, a large number of core nodes, and high reconnection probability fully promoted product diffusion. Benefit overconfidence and cost overconfidence had a significant impact on the results in different networks. As such, this study combined psychological theory with simulation methods, providing insights for future research on product diffusion.

<title>Reciprocity, transitivity, and skew: Comparing local structure in 40 positive and negative social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267886</url>
<snippet>While most social network research focuses on positive relational ties, such as friendship and information exchange, scholars are beginning to examine the dark side of human interaction, where negative connections represent different forms of interpersonal conflict, intolerance, and abuse. Despite this recent work, the extent to which positive and negative social network structure differs remains unclear. The current project considers whether a network's small-scale, structural patterns of reciprocity, transitivity, and skew, or its "structural signature," can distinguish positive versus negative links. Using exponential random graph models (ERGMs), we examine these differences across a sample of twenty distinct, negative networks and generate comparisons with a related set of twenty positive graphs. Relational ties represent multiple types of interaction such as like versus dislike in groups of adults, friendship versus cyberaggression among adolescents, and agreements versus disputes in online interaction. We find that both positive and negative networks contain more reciprocated dyads than expected by random chance. At the same time, patterns of transitivity define positive but not negative graphs, and negative networks tend to exhibit heavily skewed degree distributions. Given the unique structural signatures of many negative graphs, our results highlight the need for further theoretical and empirical research on the patterns of harmful interaction.

<title>Egocentric Social Network Structure, Health, and Pro-Social Behaviors in a National Panel Study of Americans</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036250</url>
<snippet>Using a population-based, panel survey, we study how egocentric social networks change over time, and the relationship between egocentric network properties and health and pro-social behaviors. We find that the number of prosocial activities is strongly positively associated with having more friends, or an increase in degree, with approximately 0.04 more prosocial behaviors expected for every friend added. Moreover, having more friends is associated with an improvement in health, while being healthy and prosocial is associated with closer relationships. Specifically, a unit increase in health is associated with an expected 0.45 percentage-point increase in average closeness, while adding a prosocial activity is associated with a 0.46 percentage-point increase in the closeness of one's relationships. Furthermore, a tradeoff between degree and closeness of social contacts was observed. As the number of close social contacts increases by one, the estimated average closeness of each individual contact decreases by approximately three percentage-points. The increased awareness of the importance of spillover effects in health and health care makes the ascertainment of egocentric social networks a valuable complement to investigations of the relationship between socioeconomic factors and health.

<title>Coalition-Committees as Network Interventions: Baseline Network Composition in Context of Childhood Obesity Prevention Interventions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems9030066</url>
<snippet>Community coalitions can address local issues with deep, historic, and contextual understanding that enables customized implementation of evidence-based strategies. The individuals within the coalition, their partnerships, and the social context is likely an important component of unraveling the challenges of implementation so interventions reach people in need. We focus on the relevance of baseline coalition-committee network (CCN), the networks of purposely formed subcommittees within community coalitions, structure as one of the moderating, theoretical links between community coalition social networks and intervention success. We explore the baseline composition and characteristics of five CCNs at the beginning of childhood obesity prevention interventions. Using a combination of social network, multidimensional scaling, and correspondence analyses, we examine the structure and heterogeneity of five CCNs, each consisting of a core group of stakeholders in the coalition and sometimes the broader community itself. Cross-sectional analyses are used to examine the composition of coalition-committees related to network density, centralization, hierarchy, and coalition demographics and characteristics. Results indicate that CCNs are patterned in their structure and characteristics, and we discuss whether adjustments to childhood obesity prevention interventions according to baseline structure and characteristics could be advantageous for intervention implementation. Together, these findings can inform future longitudinal investigations into CCN network structure.

<title>Social inheritance can explain the structure of animal social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12084</url>
<snippet>The social network structure of animal populations has major implications for survival, reproductive success, sexual selection and pathogen transmission of individuals. But as of yet, no general theory of social network structure exists that can explain the diversity of social networks observed in nature, and serve as a null model for detecting species and population specific factors. Here we propose a simple and generally applicable model of social network structure. We consider the emergence of network structure as a result of social inheritance, in which newborns are likely to bond with maternal contacts, and via forming bonds randomly. We compare model output with data from several species, showing that it can generate networks with properties such as those observed in real social systems. Our model demonstrates that important observed properties of social networks, including heritability of network position or assortative associations, can be understood as consequences of social inheritance.

<title>Career mobility and job flocking</title>

<snippet>Flocking is oftentimes used to metaphorically describe social behavior. Do people actually flock in a way that avian species do? This paper develops a purely ecological mechanism for explaining similarity in human behavior by distinguishing between social networks of person-to-person ties and ecological networks of ties of observability. I test the "information center hypothesis" [Ibis 115 (1973) 517] from bioecology on the career mobility of professional managers who all graduated from the same university. In this case, spatial proximity in birds is replaced with sociodemographic homophily on an acquired status characteristic among persons. The results indicate that homophilous individuals exchange information about a favorable destination state by ecological ties of observability, that is, they follow the career mobility of fellow alumni and "flock" along with them.

<snippet>Research networks encourage team science and facilitate collaboration within and across research teams. While many analyses have examined the output of these collaborative networks (e.g., authorship networks, publications, grant applications), less attention has been paid to the formative phases of these initiatives. This article presents analyses of a whole-network survey of investigators participating in a new research initiative, and examines the development of collaborative ties over the network's first year. In particular, we examine the influence of research center affiliation, seniority, and prior network experience on the number and structure of collaborative ties, including participants' bridging and broker roles. Such analyses can inform the overall management of the project in purposefully promoting new collaboration opportunities, and may ultimately predict the number of collaborative products generated by the network members.

<title>Population structure drives cultural diversity in finite populations: A hypothesis for localized community patterns on Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile)</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250690</url>
<snippet>Understanding how and why cultural diversity changes in human populations remains a central topic of debate in cultural evolutionary studies. Due to the effects of drift, small and isolated populations face evolutionary challenges in the retention of richness and diversity of cultural information. Such variation, however, can have significant fitness consequences, particularly when environmental conditions change unpredictably, such that knowledge about past environments may be key to long-term persistence. Factors that can shape the outcomes of drift within a population include the semantics of the traits as well as spatially structured social networks. Here, we use cultural transmission simulations to explore how social network structure and interaction affect the rate of trait retention and extinction. Using Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile) as an example, we develop a model-based hypothesis for how the structural constraints of communities living in small, isolated populations had dramatic effects and likely led to preventing the loss of cultural information in both community patterning and technology.

<title>Wild animals suppress the spread of socially transmitted misinformation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2215428120</url>
<snippet>Understanding the mechanisms by which information and misinformation spread through groups of individual actors is essential to the prediction of phenomena ranging from coordinated group behaviors to misinformation epidemics. Transmission of information through groups depends on the rules that individuals use to transform the perceived actions of others into their own behaviors. Because it is often not possible to directly infer decision-making strategies in situ, most studies of behavioral spread assume that individuals make decisions by pooling or averaging the actions or behavioral states of neighbors. However, whether individuals may instead adopt more sophisticated strategies that exploit socially transmitted information, while remaining robust to misinformation, is unknown. Here, we study the relationship between individual decision-making and misinformation spread in groups of wild coral reef fish, where misinformation occurs in the form of false alarms that can spread contagiously through groups. Using automated visual field reconstruction of wild animals, we infer the precise sequences of socially transmitted visual stimuli perceived by individuals during decision-making. Our analysis reveals a feature of decision-making essential for controlling misinformation spread: dynamic adjustments in sensitivity to socially transmitted cues. This form of dynamic gain control can be achieved by a simple and biologically widespread decision-making circuit, and it renders individual behavior robust to natural fluctuations in misinformation exposure.

<title>Statistical power of the social network autocorrelation model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.03.004</url>
<snippet>The network autocorrelation model has become an increasingly popular tool for conducting social network analysis. More and more researchers, however, have documented evidence of a systematic negative bias in the estimation of the network effect (rho). In this paper, we take a different approach to the problem by investigating conditions under which, despite the underestimation bias, a network effect can still be detected by the network autocorrelation model. Using simulations, we find that moderately-sized network effects (e.g., rho=.3) are still often detectable in modest-sized networks (i.e., 40 or more nodes). Analyses reveal that statistical power is primarily a nonlinear function of network effect size (rho) and network size (N), although both of these factors can interact with network density and network structure to impair power under certain rare conditions. We conclude by discussing implications of these findings and guidelines for users of the autocorrelation model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2022.2139709</url>
<snippet>In many applications of network analysis, it is important to distinguish between observed and unobserved factors affecting network structure. We show that a network model with discrete unobserved link heterogeneity and binary (or discrete) covariates corresponds to a stochastic blockmodel (SBM). We develop a spectral estimator for the effect of covariates on link probabilities, exploiting the correspondence of SBMs and generalized random dot product graphs (GRDPG). We show that computing our estimator is much faster than standard variational expectation-maximization algorithms and scales well for large networks. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the estimator performs well under different data generating processes. Our application to Facebook data shows evidence of homophily in gender, role and campus-residence, while allowing us to discover unobserved communities. Finally, we establish asymptotic normality of our estimators.

<title>The rich get richer: Extroverts' social capital on twitter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101551</url>
<snippet>Previous studies have associated social capital to one's social networks. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have looked at the interplay between one's personality, twitter activity, and number of twitter followers; with his or her social capital. Therefore, this research paper examined a correlation between these dimensions, to see if potentially people with different personalities have different benefits from their Twitter based activity. Social capital was measured by a survey (N = 218), and number of Twitter followings was analyzed based on the social ties of participants on Twitter (these data were collected using a script developed for this purpose). Our findings indicate that there is a correlation between the frequency of Twitter use, extroversion and perceived online bridging social capital of users. In other words, extroverts gain more online social capital through their online followings (when compared to their introvert counterparts); when introverts and extroverts have the same network size, extroverts gain more social capital. Furthermore, when introverts and extroverts have the same network size and also use Twitter more frequently, extroverts gain more social capital. The use of online social networking sites is significant in terms of social capital benefits. Furthermore, our results support the 'Rich get Richer' model by showing that people who are social offline benefit from their sociability also online.

<snippet>As humans, we are uniquely competent at incorporating ourselves into groups that scale up from a few members to millions of individuals to engage in joint activities in social circles of varying sizes. Yet, the question of how a group's survival depends on its social structure is not well understood. In an analysis of more than 10 122 real-life online communities (with a total of 134 147 members) hosted by a leading platform over periods of more than a decade, we observe a prominent structural difference between stable and unstable communities, enabling the prediction of sustainability up to a decade ahead. We find that communities that fail to maintain a typical hierarchical social structure that preserves cohesiveness across size scales do not survive, while communities that exhibit such balance prevail. This difference is observable in as early as the first 30 days of a community's lifetime, enabling prediction of community sustainability up to 10 years in the future. We theorize that communities comprising distinct social structures that balance global and local factors across scales of sizes are more likely to maintain sustainability.

<snippet>An important way to resolve games of conflict (snowdrift, hawk-dove, chicken) involves adopting a convention: a correlated equilibrium that avoids any conflict between aggressive strategies. Dynamic networks allow individuals to resolve conflict via their network connections rather than changing their strategy. Exploring how behavioural strategies coevolve with social networks reveals new dynamics that can help explain the origins and robustness of conventions. Here, we model the emergence of conventions as correlated equilibria in dynamic networks. Our results show that networks have the tendency to break the symmetry between the two conventional solutions in a strongly biased way. Rather than the correlated equilibrium associated with ownership norms (play aggressive at home, not away), we usually see the opposite host-guest norm (play aggressive away, not at home) evolve on dynamic networks, a phenomenon common to human interaction. We also show that learning to avoid conflict can produce realistic network structures in a way different than preferential attachment models.

<title>Double-embeddedness: Spatial and relational contexts of tie persistence and re-formation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2015.02.005</url>
<snippet>Personal relationships are embedded in both spatial and relational contexts. Using data on 60 intentional communities from the Urban Communes Data Set, we examine how such embedding is related to the persistence and re-formation of close personal ties over a thirteen year period, beginning from when most members had been out of their group environments more than a decade. We find that local network structure-the pattern of dyads immediately surrounding any dyad is extremely weighty in which ties persist, which lapse, and which are re-initiated, but that the precise ways in which local structure affects contact are bound up with the distance between dyad members. We also find asymmetries in these processes that other studies have been unable to uncover that processes that lead ties to be dropped are not the same as those that lead them to be renewed; that increases in local embeddedness are not opposite of decreases; that change in contact is not the same as change in friendship. Finally, there is evidence of hierarchical effects influencing the retention of friendships more than twenty-five years after most respondents left their groups. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

<title>Dissecting the infodemic: An in-depth analysis of COVID-19 misinformation detection on X (formerly Twitter) utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e37760</url>
<snippet>The alarming growth of misinformation on social media has become a global concern as it influences public opinions and compromises social, political, and public health development. The proliferation of deceptive information has resulted in widespread confusion, societal disturbances, and significant consequences for matters pertaining to health. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a substantial surge in the dissemination of inaccurate or deceptive information via social media platforms, particularly X (formerly known as Twitter), resulting in the phenomenon commonly referred to as an "Infodemic". This review paper examines a grand selection of 600 articles published in the past five years and focuses on conducting a thorough analysis of 87 studies that investigate the detection of fake news connected to COVID-19 on Twitter. In addition, this research explores the algorithmic techniques and methodologies used to investigate the individuals responsible for disseminating this type of fake news. A summary of common datasets, along with their fundamental qualities, for detecting fake news has been included as well. For the purpose of identifying fake news, the behavioral pattern of the misinformation spreaders, and their community analysis, we have performed an in-depth examination of the most recent literature that the researchers have worked with and recommended. Our key findings can be summarized in a few points: (a) around 80&#37; of fake news detection-related papers have utilized Deep Neural Networks-based techniques for better performance achievement, although the proposed models suffer from overfitting, vanishing gradients, and higher prediction time problems, (b) around 60&#37; of the disseminator related analysis papers focus on identifying dominant spreaders and their communities utilizing graph modeling although there is not much work done in this domain, and finally,

<title>Identifying influential nodes based on the disassortativity and community structure of complex network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-59071-x</url>
<snippet>The complex networks exhibit significant heterogeneity in node connections, resulting in a few nodes playing critical roles in various scenarios, including decision-making, disease control, and population immunity. Therefore, accurately identifying these influential nodes that play crucial roles in networks is very important. Many methods have been proposed in different fields to solve this issue. This paper focuses on the different types of disassortativity existing in networks and innovatively introduces the concept of disassortativity of the node, namely, the inconsistency between the degree of a node and the degrees of its neighboring nodes, and proposes a measure of disassortativity of the node (DoN) by a step function. Furthermore, the paper analyzes and indicates that in many real-world network applications, such as online social networks, the influence of nodes within the network is often associated with disassortativity of the node and the community boundary structure of the network. Thus, the influential metric of node based on disassortativity and community structure (mDC) is proposed. Extensive experiments are conducted in synthetic and real networks, and the performance of the DoN and mDC is validated through network robustness experiments and immune experiment of disease infection. Experimental and analytical results demonstrate that compared to other state-of-the-art centrality measures, the proposed methods (DoN and mDC) exhibits superior identification performance and efficiency, particularly in non-disassortative networks and networks with clear community structures. Furthermore, we find that the DoN and mDC exhibit high stability to network noise and inaccuracies of the network data.

<title>DIFFERENTIAL PARTICIPATION IN PROFESSIONAL ACTIVISM: THE CASE OF THE GUANTANAMO HABEAS LAWYERS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Scholars of social movements tend to regard professionals as a homogeneous group whose activism plays a secondary role in mobilization processes. In this article, I focus on activism driven by professionals themselves and therein examine how heterogeneous professionals participate in their activism. Drawing on the case of the Guantanamo habeas lawyers, I utilize a two-step methodology to investigate the factors that contribute to the differential participation of legal professionals. The first stage of analysis shows that while lawyers with higher status played a critical role in initiating professional activism under a hostile environment, the Rasul v. Bush ruling opened up a legal opportunity for lawyers with lower status to participate in activism. In the second stage, social network analyses of the lawyers' collaborative structure reveal that movement-affiliated lawyers played a bridging role that coordinated initiators and latecomers. The results have important implications for understanding professionals' participation in contentious politics.

<title>COMPLEX NETWORK ANALYSIS OF A GRAPHIC NOVEL: THE CASE OF THE BANDE DESSINeE &lt;i&gt;THORGAL&lt;/i&gt;</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219525922400033</url>
<snippet>The task of extracting and analyzing character networks from works of fiction, such as novels and movies, has been the object of a number of recent publications. However, only a very few of them focus on graphic novels, and even fewer on European graphic novels. In this paper, we focus on Thorgal, a bande dessinee, i.e. a comic of the French-Belgian tradition. We manually annotate all the volumes of this series, in order to constitute a corpus allowing us to extract its character network. We perform a descriptive analysis of the network structure and compare it to real-world and fictional social networks. We also study the effect of character filtering over the network structure. Finally, we leverage complex network analysis tools to answer two research questions from the literature, related to the similarity between Thorgal and the Saga of Icelanders; and to the position of women in the series. Our data and source code are both publicly available online.

<title>Technological position in alliances network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2014.923096</url>
<snippet>The purpose of this research was to examine the interactions between the focal firm (FF) and its technological alliance, and to enquire into the technological alliance network in shaping the firm position from innovative dynamics environment. 2-Mode network analysis was employed to explore the question of how technological position emerged from alliance interaction. Specifically, we looked at the network structure of the sample by examining the interactions of technological alliance. Our empirical data were from the 'Strategic Alliance Database' established by the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan. We identified technological position of firms from the 2-mode network analysis to resolve the highlighted question. Some results that we found were as follows: (1) The alliance network of IT technology approximated an ideal core/periphery structure. (2) The network structure apparently demonstrated that FF with a higher centrality has better opportunity to locate in the central position of FFs or in the core position in the technological network. (3) Alliance in core with a dense structure can better facilitate the utilisation of existing knowledge in refinement and extension of existing technologies. Alliance in the periphery with a non-dense structure is in a favourable position for matchmaking of experimentation and to serve as a bridge to introduce novel technologies.

<title>Influence of Social Network Strength on Entrepreneurial Opportunity Recognition: A Chain Mediation Model of Need Knowledge and Technological Knowledge</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/3817644</url>
<snippet>Entrepreneurial opportunity recognition is a key focus of entrepreneurship research and has received considerable attention in recent years. Previous research has highlighted that social network strength, need knowledge, and technological knowledge are important factors in entrepreneurial opportunity recognition and that these factors in isolation cannot sufficiently explain how entrepreneurial opportunities are recognized. Nonetheless, little is known about the effect that social network strength may exert on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition through need knowledge and technological knowledge. Building on social network theory, this study develops and examines a chain mediation model that incorporates need knowledge and technological knowledge into the relationship between social network strength and entrepreneurial opportunity recognition. The results of this study demonstrate that the effect of social network strength on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition can be partitioned into the direct and indirect effects. In particular, the effect of social network strength on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition is mediated by need knowledge, not by technological knowledge. Moreover, need knowledge and technological knowledge play a continuous mediating role in the relationship between social network strength and entrepreneurial opportunity recognition. These findings extend the entrepreneurial opportunity recognition literature by casting light on the knowledge conduits linking social network strength to entrepreneurial opportunity recognition.

<title>Network social capital as an outcome of social movement mobilization: Using the position generator as an indicator of social network diversity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2011.12.007</url>
<snippet>In the social mobility literature, the position generator (PG) has been used to examine the relationship between the structural location of individuals. and outcomes such as obtaining a high status job. Diversity of occupational ties (as measured by the PG) is also a significant predictor of an individual's cultural capital. A great deal of work has also been done in the field of social movements examining the relationship between networks and mobilization. However, only limited attention has been given to the position generator in this literature. Also, while past research has demonstrated that prior network ties to activists is one of the most important predictors of current activism, relatively little research has been devoted to examining network structure as an outcome of activism. The present paper builds upon these insights by utilizing data collected with the position generator on a sample of environmental movement members, and examining the relationship between individual activism (as an independent variable) and diversity of occupational ties (as a dependent variable). The result of key theoretical significance is that those who are more active in the environmental movement develop a greater diversity of occupational ties to other environmentalists. Results suggest that this process occurs over time. These findings provide evidence that social capital (as indicated by network diversity) is one outcome of social movement mobilization.

<title>Why network structure and coordination matter: A social network analysis of sport for disadvantaged people</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1012690216666273</url>
<snippet>Although local governments attempt to promote sports among all layers of society, people with a lower socio-economic status are still under-represented in grassroots sports. Previous studies indicate that inter-sectoral networks and joint efforts can contribute to an increase in sport participation among these groups, but a systematic analysis of the structure, coordination and interactions in the networks is still missing. Insight into networks to promote sport for disadvantaged people may help in designing effective networks. Therefore, we conducted a social network analysis to explore the network structure and characteristics of networks that promote sport participation among disadvantaged people in three Flemish cities. Our results show that the networks needed to be coordinated by a sport administrator, in the initial stage. Once the network is up and running, coordination can be shared so that the sport administration can rely on the experiences of other sectors. More sport initiatives and a better network structure were found in the cities with a community sport development program, through which the sport-for-all policy is implemented and coordinated, compared to a city without such a program.

<title>Research on the evolution of spatial network structure of tourism eco-efficiency and its influencing factors in China's provinces based on carbon emission accounting</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272667</url>
<snippet>In the context of global warming, although the coordinated development of tourism has led to regional economic growth, the high energy consumption-driven effects of such development have also led to environmental degradation. This research combines the undesired output of the Super-SBM model and social network analysis methods to determine the ecoefficiency of provincial tourism in China from 2010-2019 and analyzes its spatial correlation characteristics as well as its influencing factors. The aim of the project is to improve China's regional tourism eco-efficiency and promote cross-regional tourism correlation. The results show that (1) the mean value of provincial tourism eco-efficiency in China is maintained at 0.405 similar to 0.612, with an overall fluctuating upward trend. The tourism eco-efficiency of eastern China is higher than that of central, western and northeastern China, but the latter three regions have not formed a stable spatial distribution pattern. (2) The spatial network of provincial tourism eco-efficiency in China is multithreaded, dense and diversified. Throughout the network, affiliations are becoming closer, and network structure robustness is gradually improving, although the "hierarchical" spatial network structure remains. In individual networks, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Shandong provinces in eastern China have higher centrality degrees, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality than other provinces, which means they are dominant in the network. Hainan Province, also located in eastern China, has not yet built a "bridge" for tourism factor circulation. In the core-periphery model, the core-periphery areas of China's provincial tourism eco-efficiency are distributed in clusters, and the number of "core members" has increased. (3) The economic development level, information technology development level, and tourism technology level collectively drive the development and evolution of China's provincial tourism eco-efficiency spatial network.

<title>Relational hyperevent models for the coevolution of coauthoring and citation networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jrsssa/qnae068</url>
<snippet>The development of appropriate statistical models has lagged behind the ambitions of empirical studies analysing large scientific networks-systems of publications connected by citations and authorship. Extant research typically focuses on either paper citation networks or author collaboration networks. However, these networks involve both direct relationships, as well as broader dependencies between references linked by multiple citation paths. In this work, we extend recently developed relational hyperevent models to analyse networks characterized by complex dependencies across multiple network modes. We introduce new covariates to represent theoretically relevant and empirically plausible mixed-mode network configurations. This model specification allows testing hypotheses that recognize the polyadic nature of publication data, while accounting for multiple dependencies linking authors and references of current and prior papers. We implement the model using open-source software to analyse publicly available data on a large scientific network. Our findings reveal a tendency for subsets of papers to be cocited, indicating that the impact of these papers may be partly due to endogenous network processes. More broadly, the analysis shows that models accounting for both the hyperedge structure of publication events and the interconnections between authors and references significantly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms driving scientific production and impact.

<title>Examining the spatial networks of an urban agglomeration through the lens of multi-dimensional element flow: Evidence from western China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e20949</url>
<snippet>The Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration (CCUA), as the only national-level city cluster in southwestern China, serves as a strategic support for the Yangtze River Economic Belt and an important demonstration area for promoting new urbanization in the country. The study of the networked characteristics of the CCUA contributes to a systematic understanding of its spatial connectivity patterns, optimization of spatial structure and layout, and promotion of high-quality regional development. In this study, we constructed models for traffic flow, information flow, migration flow, and composite flow to calculate the strength of connections between cities and the total flow of various elements in the CCUA. ArcGIS spatial visualization tools were used to depict the spatial connectivity patterns of the element flows within the CCUA. Additionally, social network analysis methods, including network density, centrality, and cohesive subgroups analysis, were employed to reveal the spatial network structure characteristics of the CCUA. The findings are as follows: (1) The overall structure of the cities within the CCUA is relatively loose, with significant differences in connectivity strength. It exhibits a west-strong and east-weak pattern, with Chengdu-Chongqing, Chengdu-Deyang, Chengdu-Mianyang, and Chengdu-Meishan occupying the top tier, while Zigong and Ya'an have relatively weak connections with other cities. Chengdu and Chongqing have prominent positions in the CCUA, with Chengdu having a more prominent core position compared to Chongqing, resulting in an overall hierarchical distribution of "1 + 1+7 + 7". (2) The network density of the element flows in the CCUA is relatively low, indicating a generally weak element connectivity. The centrality of cities other than Chengdu and Chongqing is at a moderate to lower level, suggesting a weak overall resource connectivity capacity in the CCUA. (3) Most cities tend to form cohesive subgroups based on geographic proximity, while the cohesive subgroup in Chongqing is still in its early stages of development due to administrative boundaries. The research results quantitatively depict the spatial network structure characteristics of the CCUA, providing theoretical references for its development.

<title>Quantifying echo chamber effects in information spreading over political communication networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-019-0213-9</url>
<snippet>Echo chambers in online social networks, in which users prefer to interact only with ideologically-aligned peers, are believed to facilitate misinformation spreading and contribute to radicalize political discourse. In this paper, we gauge the effects of echo chambers in information spreading phenomena over political communication networks. Mining 12 million Twitter messages, we reconstruct a network in which users interchange opinions related to the impeachment of the former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. We define a continuous political leaning parameter, independent of the network's structure, that allows to quantify the presence of echo chambers in the strongly connected component of the network. These are reflected in two well-separated communities of similar sizes with opposite views of the impeachment process. By means of simple spreading models, we show that the capability of users in propagating the content they produce, measured by the associated spreading capacity, strongly depends on their attitude. Users expressing pro-impeachment leanings are capable to transmit information, on average, to a larger audience than users expressing anti-impeachment leanings. Furthermore, the users' spreading capacity is correlated to the diversity, in terms of political position, of the audience reached. Our method can be exploited to identify the presence of echo chambers and their effects across different contexts and shed light upon the mechanisms allowing to break echo chambers.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222500500323101</url>
<snippet>Organizational behavior theories generally agree that human capital is critical to teams and organizations, but little guidance exists on the extent to which such theories accurately explain the relative contributions of individual actors to overall performance. Using newly created network measures and simulations based on data obtained from a software development firm, we investigate the relative effectiveness of social network theory and resource dependency theory as predictors of individuals' contributions to team performance. Our results indicate that individual impacts on team performance are more closely associated with knowledge and task dimensions than with social network structure. Furthermore, given that knowledge may be assessed a priori, these factors provide useful guidance for structuring teams and predicting team performance.

<title>Diversity in action: Interpersonal networks and the distribution of advice</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2012.08.013</url>
<snippet>Does diversity beget the active dissemination of social support in the form of advice to others? Previous research by Robert Putnam suggests that individuals in compositionally diverse geographical areas become closed off from their social ties and less trusting of others, which are both antithetical to social support exchange. We argue, however, that studies of compositional diversity are ill-suited to reflect diversity as it is actually lived and experienced in social life. Drawing from the first nationally representative study with comprehensive indicators of interactional diversity in social life, we analyze self-reports of advice-giving across a variety of social roles. Results of regression analysis are consistent: greater interactional diversity is positively associated with advice-giving, whether the target is stranger, neighbor, close friend, or family member. These findings hold independent of important covariates such as reciprocity, sociability, and homophily. This research contributes to a growing literature set on identifying the unanticipated benefits of diversity in modern society. In sum, we call future research to consider not only diversity in structure, but also diversity in action. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<title>Utilising qualitative data for social network analysis in disaster research: opportunities, challenges, and an illustration</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/disa.12605</url>
<snippet>An abundance of unstructured and loosely structured data on disasters exists and can be analysed using network methods. This paper overviews the use of qualitative data in quantitative social network analysis in disaster research. It discusses two types of networks, each with a relevant major topic in disaster research-that is, (i) whole network approaches to emergency management networks and (ii) personal network approaches to the social support of survivors-and four usable forms of qualitative data. This paper explains five opportunities afforded by these approaches, revolving around their flexibility and ability to account for complex network structures. Next, it presents an empirical illustration that extends the authors' previous work examining the sources and the types of support and barrier experienced by households during long-term recovery from Hurricane (Superstorm) Sandy (2012), wherein quantitative social network analysis was applied to two qualitative datasets. The paper discusses three challenges associated with these approaches, related to the samples, coding, and bias.

<title>Pathways to environmental activism in four countries: social media, environmental concern, and political efficacy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13676261.2021.2011845</url>
<snippet>In 2018-9, millions of youth participated in climate-related marches across the globe. This activism reflects youth's distinctive form of political participation: cause-oriented, expressive, and networked. However, the pathway between environmental concern and environmental activism is complicated in some contexts and for some citizens. This article uses survey data from four countries (Canada, France, the United Kingdom, the United States) gathered in autumn 2019. We focus on the environmental activism of youth and young adults (aged 18-33 years, n = 1574). We find the role of social media is consistent and strong for all environmental activities in all countries; the role of political efficacy depends on activity and country but has a positive role in environmental activism; and environmental concern is a positive and significant correlate of boycotting and signing petitions but a weak predictor of participating in environmental marches. The relationship between environmental concern and environmental marches is distinctive in the United Kingdom. Overall, we find that concern about a social cause does not automatically translate into increased activism related to that cause. Moreover, online social networks, political efficacy, and political context are critical to understanding this mobilization process.

<title>Predicting urban innovation from the US Workforce Mobility Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-020-00685-7</url>
<snippet>While great emphasis has been placed on the role of social interactions as a driver of innovation growth, very few empirical studies have explicitly investigated the impact of social network structures on the innovation performance of cities. Past research has mostly explored scaling laws of socio-economic outputs of cities as determined by, for example, the single predictor of population. Here, by drawing on a publicly available dataset of the startup ecosystem, we build the first Workforce Mobility Network among metropolitan areas in the US. We found that node centrality computed on this network accounts for most of the variability observed in cities' innovation performance and significantly outperforms other predictors such as population size or density, suggesting that policies and initiatives aiming at sustaining innovation processes might benefit from fostering professional networks alongside other economic or systemic incentives. As opposed to previous approaches powered by census data, our model can be updated in real-time upon open databases, opening up new opportunities both for researchers in a variety of disciplines to study urban economies in new ways, and for practitioners to design tools for monitoring such economies in real-time.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47499-8</url>
<snippet>Social networks are a mathematical representation of interactions among individuals which are prevalent across various animal species. Studies of human populations have shown the breadth of what can spread throughout a social network: obesity, smoking cessation, happiness, drug use and divorce. 'Betweenness centrality' is a key property of social networks that indicates an individual's importance in facilitating communication and cohesion within the network. Heritability of betweenness centrality has been suggested in several species, however the genetic regulation of this property remains enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that the gene CG14109, referred to as degrees of kevin bacon (dokb), influences betweenness centrality in Drosophila melanogaster. We identify strain-specific alleles of dokb with distinct amino acid sequences and when the dokb allele is exchanged between strains, flies exhibit the betweenness centrality pattern dictated by the donor allele. By inserting a GAL4 reporter into the dokb locus, we confirm that dokb is expressed in the central nervous system. These findings define a novel genetic entry point to study social network structure and thereby establish gene-to-social structure relationships. While dokb sequence homology is exclusive to Diptera, we anticipate that dokb-associated molecular pathways could unveil convergent neural mechanisms of social behaviour that apply in diverse animal species.

<title>Abstract cognitive maps of social network structure aid adaptive inference</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2310801120</url>
<snippet>Social navigation-such as anticipating where gossip may spread, or identifying which acquaintances can help land a job-relies on knowing how people are connected within their larger social communities. Problematically, for most social networks, the space of possible relationships is too vast to observe and memorize. Indeed, people's knowledge of these social relations is well known to be biased and error- prone. Here, we reveal that these biased representations reflect a fundamental computation that abstracts over individual relationships to enable principled inferences about unseen relationships. We propose a theory of network representation that explains how people learn inferential cognitive maps of social relations from direct observation, what kinds of knowledge structures emerge as a consequence, and why it can be beneficial to encode systematic biases into social cognitive maps. Leveraging simulations, laboratory experiments, and "field data" from a real -world network, we find that people abstract observations of direct relations (e.g., friends) into inferences of multistep relations (e.g., friends - of- friends).This multistep abstraction mechanism enables people to discover and represent complex social network structure, affording adaptive inferences across a variety of contexts, includ-ing friendship, trust, and advice- giving. Moreover, this multistep abstraction mechanism unifies a variety of otherwise puzzling empirical observations about social behavior. Our proposal generalizes the theory of cognitive maps to the fundamental computational problem of social inference, presenting a powerful framework for understanding the workings of a predictive mind operating within a complex social world.SignificanceSuccessful navigation through our social communities-from identifying which "weak ties" can help land a job to deciding whether a friend -of - a- friendcan be trusted-necessitates that people build cognitive maps of how individuals are connected within a social network. Because our observations of others' relationships are noisy and incomplete, people need to fill gaps in relational knowledge by inferring the existence of unknown and unobserved relationships. Here, we demonstrate that predictive inferences emerge from a simple cognitive mechanism that abstracts observations of known friendships to multistep relations (e.g., friends - of- friends).This mechanism can parsimoniously explain how people infer a variety of social behaviors, like trust and advice- seeking.

<title>Ties that bind? Race and networks in job turnover</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/sp.2007.54.4.483</url>
<snippet>This article seeks to clarify the role of race and social networks in job turnover. Analyses using the personnel records of roughly 300 entry level workers in a private organization investigate the extent to which social networks in the job attainment process affect turnover Specifically, I examine what occurs when the social network contact is from inside versus outside of the company, when the contact is white or minority and when a contact and applicant share a race or when they do not. Referrals from current employee contacts reduce voluntary turnover while referrals from nonemployees do not provide a turnover advantage. White and minority contacts yield similar levels of job turnover and both generate lower levels of turnover than noncontacts, a finding that lends partial support to social capital theory. Finally, I find modest support for homophily theory; compared to race-mismatched contact-applicant dyads, race-matched dyads have lower levels of voluntary turnover but similar levels of involuntary turnover The results illustrate the lasting effects of race-based social networks. I propose suggestions for designing research that can further our understanding of the mechanisms allegedly at work in the race, social network, and job turnover relationship.

<title>Mnemonic convergence in social networks: The emergent properties of cognition at a collective level</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1525569113</url>
<snippet>The development of shared memories, beliefs, and norms is a fundamental characteristic of human communities. These emergent outcomes are thought to occur owing to a dynamic system of information sharing and memory updating, which fundamentally depends on communication. Here we report results on the formation of collective memories in laboratory-created communities. We manipulated conversational network structure in a series of real-time, computer-mediated interactions in fourteen 10-member communities. The results show that mnemonic convergence, measured as the degree of overlap among community members' memories, is influenced by both individual-level information-processing phenomena and by the conversational social network structure created during conversational recall. By studying laboratory-created social networks, we show how large-scale social phenomena (i.e., collective memory) can emerge out of microlevel local dynamics (i.e., mnemonic reinforcement and suppression effects). The social-interactionist approach proposed herein points to optimal strategies for spreading information in social networks and provides a framework for measuring and forging collective memories in communities of individuals.

<title>The strength of dynamic ties: The ability to alter some ties promotes cooperation in those that cannot be altered</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aau9109</url>
<snippet>Dynamic networks, where ties can be shed and new ties can be formed, promote the evolution of cooperation. Yet, past research has only compared networks where all ties can be severed to those where none can, confounding the benefits of fully dynamic networks with the presence of some dynamic ties within the network. Further, humans do not live in fully dynamic networks. Instead, in real-world networks, some ties are subject to change, while others are difficult to sever. Here, we consider whether and how cooperation evolves in networks containing both static and dynamic ties. We argue and find that the presence of dynamic ties in networks promotes cooperation even in static ties. Consistent with previous work demonstrating that cooperation cascades in networks, our results show that cooperation is enhanced in networks with both tie types because the higher rate of cooperation that occurs following the dynamics process "spills over" to those relations that are more difficult to alter. Thus, our findings demonstrate the critical role that dynamic ties play in promoting cooperation by altering behavioral outcomes even in non-dynamic relations.

<title>Exploring Conservation Actor Networks in Trinidad And Tobago</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2022.2092668</url>
<snippet>Networks play an important role in conservation by facilitating and strengthening collaboration among conservation organizations. This study explores the structural characteristics of networks that could promote or inhibit conservation in Trinidad and Tobago. To achieve this, a questionnaire was sent out to all identifiable conservation actors on the island. Social network analysis software was used to analyze the data and generate network measures and maps. Results show that there are 69 conservation organizations on the island and NGOs play an important role. The overall network density and centralization are low while network cohesion across most categories of actor subgroups was positive. Ego network measures on centrality and brokerage were used to provide recommendations that could help to strengthen collaboration between organizations. As the first study of its kind using network analysis applied to conservation in this geographical context, it can help to inform future conservation research and initiatives.

<title>Identification of influencers in online social networks: measuring influence considering multidimensional factors exploration</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06472</url>
<snippet>Online Social networks exhibit heterogeneous nature with nodes playing far different roles in structure and function. To identify influencers is thus very significant, allowing us to control the outbreak of public negative opinion, to conduct advertisements for e-commercial products, to predict popular scientific publications, and so on. The identification of influencers attracts increasing attentions from both computer science and communication science, with multiple dimensional metrics ranging from structure-based to information-based and action-based. However, most work simply rely on one dimensional metrics. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze three dimensional characteristics (structure-based, information-based, and action-based factors) to develop the multi-dimensional social influence (MSI) measurement approach. With topic distillation and conditional expectation, the MSI approach can not only measure users topic-level influence, but also measure users global-level influence. Based on data collected from SinaWeibo.com, the experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms two traditional methods (LeaderRank and FBI) both on the topic-level and the global-level. The proposed framework can be effectively applied to promote word-of-mouth marketing, and to steer public opinion in certain directions, even to support decisions during a negotiation process.

<title>Beyond collective intelligence: Collective adaptation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2022.0736</url>
<snippet>We develop a conceptual framework for studying collective adaptation in complex socio-cognitive systems, driven by dynamic interactions of social integration strategies, social environments and problem structures. Going beyond searching for 'intelligent' collectives, we integrate research from different disciplines and outline modelling approaches that can be used to begin answering questions such as why collectives sometimes fail to reach seemingly obvious solutions, how they change their strategies and network structures in response to different problems and how we can anticipate and perhaps change future harmful societal trajectories. We discuss the importance of considering path dependence, lack of optimization and collective myopia to understand the sometimes counterintuitive outcomes of collective adaptation. We call for a transdisciplinary, quantitative and societally useful social science that can help us to understand our rapidly changing and ever more complex societies, avoid collective disasters and reach the full potential of our ability to organize in adaptive collectives.

<title>Toolbox of individual-level interventions against online misinformation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-01881-0</url>
<snippet>The spread of misinformation through media and social networks threatens many aspects of society, including public health and the state of democracies. One approach to mitigating the effect of misinformation focuses on individual-level interventions, equipping policymakers and the public with essential tools to curb the spread and influence of falsehoods. Here we introduce a toolbox of individual-level interventions for reducing harm from online misinformation. Comprising an up-to-date account of interventions featured in 81 scientific papers from across the globe, the toolbox provides both a conceptual overview of nine main types of interventions, including their target, scope and examples, and a summary of the empirical evidence supporting the interventions, including the methods and experimental paradigms used to test them. The nine types of interventions covered are accuracy prompts, debunking and rebuttals, friction, inoculation, lateral reading and verification strategies, media-literacy tips, social norms, source-credibility labels, and warning and fact-checking labels. Kozyreva et al. review evidence from individual-level interventions for fighting online misinformation featured in 81 scientific papers. They classify the interventions in nine different types and summarize their findings in a toolbox.

<title>Emergence of social support networks among breast cancer survivors through a community-based physical activity program in Colombia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.12.007</url>
<snippet>Physical activity (PA), social networks, and social support have been associated with decreased mortality and improved quality of life among breast cancer survivors (BCS). This study used social network analysis to un-derstand the social co-benefits of a community-based PA program for BCS in Colombia. Two types of social support networks emerged from the program: friendship (the number of edges increased by 90 &#37;) and PA support (35 &#37; of participants practiced PA together after the program). Using egocentric and socio-centric analysis we show the presence of homophily for friendship and PA support relations and the BCS's roles in their networks.

<title>Values and economic performance across European welfare state regimes: Direct and indirect effects through social capital, human capital and managerial skills</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0298667</url>
<snippet>The values that people hold are linked to their economic performance. These links can be either direct or indirect, operating through moderating variables such as social network participation, interpersonal trust, trust in institutions, human capital, managerial skills and hours worked. In this paper these effects are studied using structural equation modelling (SEM) methodology applied to European Social Survey data from 28 European countries in 2018. Schwartz classification of values is used, distinguishing between Self-Enhancement (Power, Achievement), Openness to Change (Self-Direction), Conservation (Tradition, Security, Conformity) and Self-Transcendence (Universalism, Benevolence) values. It is found that Power has the strongest positive direct effect on economic performance, further strengthened by a positive indirect structural effect through hours worked. Self-Direction is indirectly positively linked to economic performance through higher managerial skills and hours worked. Tradition has a strong negative direct effect on economic performance. Security is indirectly negatively linked with economic performance, owing to its negative effects on interpersonal trust, management skills and hours worked. Some of the identified effects are context-dependent and vary across European welfare state regimes. For example, Power is statistically significantly linked to economic performance only in the liberal and conservative regime. Values promoted by respective welfare state regimes are not necessarily associated with higher incomes within those regimes, e.g., Tradition and Security values promoted in the conservative and Mediterranean regime are associated with lower incomes. These findings may lead to a range of policy implications, particularly in relation to the policies on immigration, demographics, the labor market, and work-life balance. Unfortunately, due to the cross-sectional character of the dataset, causal relations among the variables of interest could not be identified.

<title>Successful Linkage Between Formal and Informal Care Systems: The Mobilization of Outside Help by Caregivers of Persons With Alzheimer's Disease</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1049732312451870</url>
<snippet>Health interventions are currently being revamped to address the specific needs of chronic illness and population aging. In this context, focus has increasingly turned to Alzheimer-type dementia, an illness that is considered to mobilize a large number of social actors into long-term involvement of varying intensity. Linkage problems between families and professional systems have been well documented, yet the reasons for this remain relatively unexplored. In this article, we outline how we used social network data and narrative methods to better understand the linkage processes between formal and informal care systems. We present the trajectories of four caregivers of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease who were able to establish relationships with resources outside the family. In each of the cases, the dimensions of trust and recognition were central to establishing and maintaining supportive relationships, and must therefore be understood in light of social network dynamics and the broader environment. Although preliminary, this study contributes to the state of knowledge on linkage problems by proposing "bottom-up" solutions that are client centered.

<title>The effects of reputational and social knowledge on cooperation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1415883112</url>
<snippet>The emergence and sustenance of cooperative behavior is fundamental for a society to thrive. Recent experimental studies have shown that cooperation increases in dynamic networks in which subjects can choose their partners. However, these studies did not vary reputational knowledge, or what subjects know about other's past actions, which has long been recognized as an important factor in supporting cooperation. They also did not give subjects access to global social knowledge, or information on who is connected to whom in the group. As a result, it remained unknown how reputational and social knowledge foster cooperative behavior in dynamic networks both independently and by complementing each other. In an experimental setting, we show that global reputational knowledge is crucial to sustaining a high level of cooperation and welfare. Cooperation is associated with the emergence of dense and clustered networks with highly cooperative hubs. Global social knowledge has no effect on the aggregate level of cooperation. A community analysis shows that the addition of global social knowledge to global reputational knowledge affects the distribution of cooperative activity: cooperators form a separate community that achieves a higher cooperation level than the community of defectors. Members of the community of cooperators achieve a higher payoff from interactions within the community than members of the less cooperative community.

<title>Can social network analysis contribute to supply chain management? A systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e26598</url>
<snippet>Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a modeling technique and analytical approach well-suited for identifying and examining the structural features of supply networks and the patterns of connections between members within the network. This paper aims to present a systematic review and bibliometric analysis by investigating network structural properties and metrics in supply chain management (SCM) research. The approach involved combining a systematic literature review with a bibliometric analysis, forming a two-part methodology to examine 113 articles published between 2008 and 2023 in 62 journals. Our systematic thematic analysis reveals how SCM researchers have applied SNA techniques in terms of the reported node-level and networklevel structural metrics, including network configuration description metrics, centrality measures, supply network subgroups, and models of supply network structure and formation. We identify the gaps in the existing body of literature and propose potential directions for future research. By quantitatively analyzing, classifying, and visualizing bibliographic data of previous studies, this paper provides further insights into the application of network structural properties in SCM research. Furthermore, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the significance of the supply network's relational structure and configuration. Considering the disruptions to global supply chains caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russo-Ukrainian War, our findings can contribute to a better understanding of strategic supply network design.

<title>Cumulative Dynamics of Independent Information Spreading Behaviour: A Physical Perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-05899-5</url>
<snippet>The popularization of information spreading in online social networks facilitates daily communication among people. Although much work has been done to study the effect of interactions among people on spreading, there is less work that considers the pattern of spreading behaviour when people independently make their decisions. By comparing microblogging, an important medium for information spreading, with the disordered spin glass system, we find that there exist interesting corresponding relationships between them. And the effect of aging can be observed in both systems. Based on the analogy with the Trap Model of spin glasses, we derive a model with a unified powerfunction form for the growth of independent spreading activities. Our model takes several key factors into consideration, including memory effect, the dynamics of human interest, and the fact that older messages are more difficult to discover. We validate our model by a real-world microblogging data set. Our work indicates that, other than various features, some invariable rules should be considered during spreading prediction. This work also contributes a useful methodology for studying human dynamics.

<title>Inequality is rising where social network segregation interacts with urban topology</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21465-0</url>
<snippet>Social networks amplify inequalities by fundamental mechanisms of social tie formation such as homophily and triadic closure. These forces sharpen social segregation, which is reflected in fragmented social network structure. Geographical impediments such as distance and physical or administrative boundaries also reinforce social segregation. Yet, less is known about the joint relationships between social network structure, urban geography, and inequality. In this paper we analyze an online social network and find that the fragmentation of social networks is significantly higher in towns in which residential neighborhoods are divided by physical barriers such as rivers and railroads. Towns in which neighborhoods are relatively distant from the center of town and amenities are spatially concentrated are also more socially segregated. Using a two-stage model, we show that these urban geography features have significant relationships with income inequality via social network fragmentation. In other words, the geographic features of a place can compound economic inequalities via social networks. Not much is known about the joint relationships between social network structure, urban geography, and inequality. Here, the authors analyze an online social network and find that the fragmentation of social networks is significantly higher in towns in which residential neighborhoods are divided by physical barriers such as rivers and railroads.

<title>The Mechanism Explaining the Effect of HEXACO Traits on Vietnamese University Graduates' Networking Behavior for Finding Employment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440231178260</url>
<snippet>This study examines the relationships between university graduates' HEXACO traits and networking behavior for finding a job through job search network size. We integrate individual difference theory and social network theory to explain these links in two manners. We use individual difference theory to demonstrate that graduates with HEXACO personality traits have different job search network sizes, and we apply social network theory to test whether job search network size affect the networking intensity of graduates. The sample of 773 graduates was collected at two points with a 3 months-lagged time. Our results suggest that three HEXACO traits had an effect on job search network size. At the same time, job search network size play role in increasing networking behavior. Specifically, job search network size served as partial mediator in the relationships between HEXACO traits and networking behavior. The findings, theoretical, practical implications, and future research are discussed further.

<title>Social finance as cultural evolution, transmission bias, and market dynamics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2015568118</url>
<snippet>The thoughts and behaviors of financial market participants depend upon adopted cultural traits, including information signals, beliefs, strategies, and folk economic models. Financial traits compete to survive in the human population and are modified in the process of being transmitted from one agent to another. These cultural evolutionary processes shape market outcomes, which in turn feed back into the success of competing traits. This evolutionary system is studied in an emerging paradigm, social finance. In this paradigm, social transmission biases determine the evolution of financial traits in the investor population. It considers an enriched set of cultural traits, both selection on traits and mutation pressure, and market equilibrium at different frequencies. Other key ingredients of the paradigm include psychological bias, social network structure, information asymmetries, and institutional environment.

<title>Transnational entrepreneurial activities: A qualitative network study of self-employed migrants from the former Soviet Union in Germany</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2017.04.007</url>
<snippet>During their careers, migrant entrepreneurs may get involved in different types of transnational entrepreneurial activities and use their social capital to activate transnational business-related ties. Based on content analysis of semi-structured interviews and networks maps with self-employed migrants from the former Soviet Union in Germany this study identified four empirically grounded types of migrant transnational entrepreneurial activities and analysed transnational networking strategies for each type. The study demonstrates that different types of social capital are mobilised for different types of transnational business strategies, with intensive transnational entrepreneurial activities requiring larger pre-existing networks in the country of origin of both strong and weak ties, that are gradually extended, while a more limited set of mostly informal weak ties suffice for more sporadic transnational activities in the country of origin. Transnational entrepreneurial activities with other countries or with multiple countries, on the other hand, involved a more formal network of relationships. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

<snippet>The epidemic has had a profound negative impact on individuals worldwide, leading to pervasive anxiety, fear, and mental instability. Exploiting these fears, a significant amount of fake information proliferates and spreads rapidly on social networks. This study explores the factors that cause individuals to believe fake news under stressful and fearful conditions by applying the truth-default theory. Data was collected online in Vietnam, using Smart PLS software to analyze the research model. The findings indicated that risk perception, media trust, trust in celebrity posts, and stress were factors that urge users to believe news posted on social media, and even they actively share this news on their own channels. Disclosure willingness moderated the relationship between adoption fake news and sharing it. Both theoretical and practical implications were discussed.

<snippet>Based on the daily stock closing price data of 14 A-share listed banks in China from January 2009 to June 2021, this paper makes a comparative analysis of the contagion effect of risks in the banking industry before and after the outbreak of COVID-19. Based on the transfer entropy method, this paper calculates the correlation network matrix of inter-bank risk contagion effect and empirically studies the contagion effect of risks in the banking industry before and after the outbreak by using social network analysis method, depicting the network structure of systemic risk contagion in Chinese banking industry. This study found that the risk of inter-bank system increased significantly after the outbreak and the key nodes of bank risk contagion have also changed before and after the outbreak; state-owned banks are less risky, joint-stock banks and local financial institutions are riskier, and the contagion effect of risks between banks is asymmetric.

<title>Obstacle avoidance in social groups: new insights from asynchronous models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2015.0178</url>
<snippet>For moving animals, the successful avoidance of hazardous obstacles is an important capability. Despite this, few models of collective motion have addressed the relationship between behavioural and social features and obstacle avoidance. We develop an asynchronous individual-based model for social movement which allows social structure within groups to be included. We assess thedynamics of groupnavigation and resulting collision risk in the context of information transfer through the system. In agreement with previous work, we find that group size has a nonlinear effect on collision risk. We implement examples of possible network structures to explore the impact social preferences have on collision risk. We show that any social heterogeneity induces greater obstacle avoidance with further improvements corresponding to groups containing fewer influential individuals. The model provides a platform for both further theoretical investigation and practical application. In particular, we argue that the role of social structures within bird flocks may have an important role to play in assessing the risk of collisions with wind turbines, but that new methods of data analysis are needed to identify these social structures.

Openness predicts network diversity and is marginally related to position when groups pursue collective goals. Conscientiousness is associated with maintaining certain personal relationships, but is strongly related to central positions in workplace networks.

<title>Evidence-informed policymaking and policy innovation in a low-income country: does policy network structure matter?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1332/174426418X15330477583836</url>
<snippet>The application of social network analysis to policy networks continues to grow, including the application of social network analysis tools and concepts in order to explain policy outcomes. Gaps in this field of study persist in terms of both policy issues studied, as well as types of polities or networks analysed. This study extends previous research on the role of network structure in shaping policy outcomes by analysing network structure's effect on the use of research evidence by three health policy networks in Burkina Faso, a low-income West African country, and the resulting innovativeness of the policies made. This comparative case study confirms certain hypotheses related to the effect of network closure and heterogeneity on evidence use and innovation; namely, that heterogeneous networks are more likely to be exposed to new ideas, and thus to use research evidence and adopt innovative policies. High levels of centralised control and power may support innovation when the new ideas are consistent with the dominant network paradigms; otherwise, new ideas may receive less traction. These findings confirm previous research and point to opportunities to shape networks to achieve innovation and policy change based on the best evidence.

<title>Dynamic social networks promote cooperation in experiments with humans</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1108243108</url>
<snippet>Human populations are both highly cooperative and highly organized. Human interactions are not random but rather are structured in social networks. Importantly, ties in these networks often are dynamic, changing in response to the behavior of one's social partners. This dynamic structure permits an important form of conditional action that has been explored theoretically but has received little empirical attention: People can respond to the cooperation and defection of those around them by making or breaking network links. Here, we present experimental evidence of the power of using strategic link formation and dissolution, and the network modification it entails, to stabilize cooperation in sizable groups. Our experiments explore large-scale cooperation, where subjects' cooperative actions are equally beneficial to all those with whom they interact. Consistent with previous research, we find that cooperation decays over time when social networks are shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all rounds. We also find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated only infrequently, cooperation again fails. However, when subjects can update their network connections frequently, we see a qualitatively different outcome: Cooperation is maintained at a high level through network rewiring. Subjects preferentially break links with defectors and form new links with cooperators, creating an incentive to cooperate and leading to substantial changes in network structure. Our experiments confirm the predictions of a set of evolutionary game theoretic models and demonstrate the important role that dynamic social networks can play in supporting large- scale human cooperation.

<title>Referrals and information flow in networks increase discrimination: A laboratory experiment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.03.005</url>
<snippet>Referrals and information flow distort market mechanisms of hiring in the labor market, but they might assist employers under asymmetric information in finding better alternatives. This paper investigates whether an impartial information flow between employers in a cyclic network structure could generate more discrimination than when no information is exchanged between employers. We set up an artificial labor market in which there was no average quality difference between two categories of workers. We asked participants to play the role of employers and examined the partiality of their hiring choices. Results showed that discrimination was prevalent in all conditions. Higher standards by the employers for the quality of workers increased discrimination as did the presence of referrals from workers. Unexpectedly, impartial information flow in a cyclic network of employers did not help to decrease discrimination. We also showed that these mechanisms interact with and subdue each other in complex ways. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

<title>Excess reciprocity distorts reputation in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-03481-7</url>
<snippet>The peer-to-peer (P2P) economy relies on establishing trust in distributed networked systems, where the reliability of a user is assessed through digital peer-review processes that aggregate ratings into reputation scores. Here we present evidence of a network effect which biases digital reputation, revealing that P2P networks display exceedingly high levels of reciprocity. In fact, these are much higher than those compatible with a null assumption that preserves the empirically observed level of agreement between all pairs of nodes, and rather close to the highest levels structurally compatible with the networks' reputation landscape. This indicates that the crowdsourcing process underpinning digital reputation can be significantly distorted by the attempt of users to mutually boost reputation, or to retaliate, through the exchange of ratings. We uncover that the least active users are predominantly responsible for such reciprocity-induced bias, and that this fact can be exploited to obtain more reliable reputation estimates. Our findings are robust across different P2P platforms, including both cases where ratings are used to vote on the content produced by users and to vote on user profiles.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2020.1739263</url>
<snippet>Firm innovation is embedded in a collaboration network among researchers and a knowledge network composed of knowledge elements; the two networks are decoupled. Guided by social network theory, this study puts forward the definition and the classification of firm dual network structure, probes into the influence of dual network structure on firm performance, and explores the alignment between innovation strategy and firm dual network structure. We conduct an empirical study of 183 listed companies in China from 2004 to 2018. It is found that the four types of dual network structure all have positive impacts on firm performance, and the impact of a collaboration network is slightly higher than that of a knowledge network. Besides, innovation strategy plays a positive moderating role in the relationship between dual network structure and firm performance. Our findings provide new ideas for firms to identify and optimise knowledge and collaboration network structures and match them with innovation strategy to improve performance.

<title>Spatial correlation network structure of energy-environment efficiency and its driving factors: a case study of the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-47370-8</url>
<snippet>Improving energy-environment efficiency is not only a requirement for constructing China's ecological civilization but also inevitable for achieving sustainable economic and social development. Studies on energy-environment efficiency based on relational data and network perspectives are limited, which hinders the development of collaborative regional emission reduction activities. This study uses the SBM-Undesirable model to measure the energy-environment efficiency of the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration from 2010 to 2020, adopts a modified gravity model and social network analysis to reveal the structural characteristics of its spatial correlation network, and explores its driving factors through the QAP method. The study found (1) an overall upward trend in energy-environment efficiency but with problems of uneven development. ( 2) The spatial correlation of energy-environment efficiency shows a complex network structure, with increasing network correlation and strong network stability; the network can be divided into four plates: net benefit, net overflow, two-way spillover, and agent. (3) Differences in industrial structure, environmental regulation, economic development, and technological innovation significantly impact the formation of spatial correlation network of energy- environment efficiency. This study provides a reference for the construction of a cross-regional synergistic mechanism to improve energy-environment efficiency.

<title>Venture Capital Syndication Network Structure of Public Companies: Robustness and Dynamic Evolution, China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems11060302</url>
<snippet>Venture capital plays a vital role in boosting economic growth by providing an inexhaustible impetus for economic innovation and development. We use all the joint venture capital events of Chinese listed companies in the past 10 years to describe the characteristics of the joint venture capital network structure, identify the dynamic evolution characteristics of the community, and introduce random attacks and deliberate attacks to explore the resilience of joint venture capital cooperation. The study finds that the joint venture capital network in China has expanded in scale, with an increasing number of participants and a diversified investment industry. However, the connection between members within the network remains relatively loose, indicating fragmentation and a need to improve network quality. The community structure of core members is significant, with evident differences in scale. The network exhibits weak robustness, relying heavily on key enterprises and demonstrating a poor ability to resist external interference. The study proposes countermeasures and suggestions for optimizing the network structure of joint venture capital, aiming to enhance the environment and performance of joint venture capital and promote the high-quality development of China's joint venture capital market.

<title>Too many options: How to identify coalitions in a policy network?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2024.06.005</url>
<snippet>For different currents in policy analysis as policy networks and the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), identifying coalitions from policy beliefs and coordination between actors is crucial to a precise understanding of a policy process. Focusing particularly the relational dimension of ACF approaches linked with policy network analysis, determining policy subsystems from the actor collaborations and exchanges has recently begun offering fertile links with the network analysis. Studies in this way frequently apply Block Modeling and Community Detection (BMCD) strategies to define homogeneous political groups. However, the BMCD literature is growing quickly, using a wide variety of algorithms and interesting selection methods that are much more diverse than those used in the policy network analysis and particularly the ACF when this current focused on the collaboration networks before or after regarding the belief distance between actors. Identifying the best methodological option in a specific context can therefore be difficult and few ACF studies give an explicit justification. On the other hand, few BMCD publications offer a systematic comparison of real social networks and they are never applied to policy network datasets. This paper offers a new, relevant 5-Step selection method to reconcile advances in both the policy networks/ACF and BMCD. Using an application based on original African policy network data collected in Madagascar and Niger, we provide a useful set of practical recommendations for future ACF studies using policy network analysis: (i) the density and size of the policy network affect the identification process, (ii) the "best algorithm"can be rigorously determined by maximizing a novel indicator based on convergence and homogeneity between algorithm results, (iii) researchers need to be careful with missing data: they affect the results and imputation does not solve the problem.

<title>Measuring trustworthiness of information diffusion by risk discovery process in social networking services</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-013-9837-1</url>
<snippet>Most of current social network services are vulnerable to malicious actions. For example, rumor (e.g., contaminated and distorted information) can be diffused along the social links. In this paper, given a social network service, we design a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, and propose a robust information diffusion model to efficiently detect the malicious peers from which a risk (i.e., rumor) has been generated on the P2P network. Thereby, by aggregating social interactions among users, a set of interaction sequences are obtained. Given a set of interaction sequences, statistical sequence mining method is exploited to discover a certain social position which provides peculiar patterns on the P2P networks. For evaluating the proposed method, we conducted two experimentations with NetLogo simulation platform for risk discovery on social network.

<title>Spatial Pattern and Evolution of Global Innovation Network from 2000 to 2019: Global Patent Dataset Perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/5912696</url>
<snippet>In the era of the knowledge economy, the improvement of national innovation systems is playing a significant role in the global entrepreneurship ecosystem. Entrepreneurs are accelerating international intellectual property applications to be competitive. What remains to be explored is the evolution of international intellectual property network in the globe. With the application of social network analysis and intellectual property application database, the global innovation network structure from 2000 to 2019 is explored. Results showed that (1) in the period 2000-2019, the global innovation network has been expanding rapidly from a sparse network to a dense and complex one. (2) Patent application is unevenly distributed in the globe. Countries such as the US, China, and Canada have been the top countries flowing in, while Japan, Korea, EU, and Switzerland have been the main countries flowing out. (3) Global innovation network shows an obvious "core-periphery" pattern. The distribution pattern presents a quadrilateral structure with the four core regions of "US, Japan, EU, and China" as the apex. This analysis contributes to the visualization of the global layout of intellectual property and the evolution trend by analyzing intellectual property application networks. This can provide important experience reference for enterprises to study the global entrepreneurship ecosystem.

<title>'Entanglement' - A new dynamic metric to measure team flow</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.11.010</url>
<snippet>We introduce "entanglement", a novel metric to measure how synchronized communication between team members is. This measure calculates the Euclidean distance among team members' social network metrics timeseries. We validate the metric with four case studies. The first case study uses entanglement of 11 medical innovation teams to predict team performance and learning behavior. The second case looks at the e-mail communication of 113 senior executives of an international services firm, predicting employee turnover through lack of entanglement of an employee. The third case analyzes the individual employee performance of 81 managers. The fourth case study predicts performance of 13 customer-dedicated teams at a big international company by comparing entanglement in the e-mail interactions with satisfaction of their customers measured through Net Promoter Score (NPS). While we can only speculate about what is causing the entanglement effect, we find that it is a new and versatile indicator for the analysis of employees' communication, analyzing the hitherto underused temporal dimension of online social networks which could be used as a powerful predictor of employee and team performance, employee turnover, and customer satisfaction.

<title>Analyzing actors' interaction behavior in land transactions in informal settlement settings: A case study of Burayu city, Ethiopia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e19515</url>
<snippet>Informality plays an imperative role in offering housing for households in developing countries when the formal market cannot provide enough to keep up with residents' demands. The actors' interaction, with one another, plays an imperative role in land transactions in informal settlement areas. As informal actors operate outside the formal land transactions their activities and methods of operation are rarely understood. Therefore, based on social network theory, this paper aims to identify and examine informal actors, their functions, interactions, and power relationships in informal settlement areas. To this end, this study employed key informant interviews, focus group discussions, structured questionnaires, and a review of published literature, as well as official documents. In the study area, most residents acquired land through informal mechanisms. Major actors include farmers, local land administrators, speculators, land brokers, residents, government officials, and religious leaders. The study also uncovers that the role of each actor varies from information provision to price fixing. Their roles and interactions are governed by dynamic networks and occasionally overlap functions. Among the network actors, land brokers are considered the most influential and powerful because they possess a high degree of centrality, closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector. They hold a pivotal position in the network and act as a liaison between the network's actors. Therefore, the roles of land brokers, who often actively influence the land transaction process, should be considered in urban land governance and incorporated in policy formulation and implementation.

<title>Identifying critical higher-order interactions in complex networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-00017-y</url>
<snippet>Diffusion on networks is an important concept in network science observed in many situations such as information spreading and rumor controlling in social networks, disease contagion between individuals, and cascading failures in power grids. The critical interactions in networks play critical roles in diffusion and primarily affect network structure and functions. While interactions can occur between two nodes as pairwise interactions, i.e., edges, they can also occur between three or more nodes, which are described as higher-order interactions. This report presents a novel method to identify critical higher-order interactions in complex networks. We propose two new Laplacians to generalize standard graph centrality measures for higher-order interactions. We then compare the performances of the generalized centrality measures using the size of giant component and the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) simulation model to show the effectiveness of using higher-order interactions. We further compare them with the first-order interactions (i.e., edges). Experimental results suggest that higher-order interactions play more critical roles than edges based on both the size of giant component and SIR, and the proposed methods are promising in identifying critical higher-order interactions.

<title>With Friends Like These Endogenous Labor Market Segregation with Homogeneous, Nonprejudiced Agents</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1536-7150.2009.00647.x</url>
<snippet>In the economics literature, labor market segregation is typically assumed to arise either from prejudice (Becker 1971) or from group differences in human capital accumulation (Benabou 1993; Durlauf 2006; Fryer 2006). Many sociological studies, by contrast, consider social network structure as an embodiment of various forms of social capital, including the creation of obligations, information channels, and enforceable trust (Coleman 1988; Portes and Sensenbrenner 1993). When firms hire by referral, social network segregation can lead to labor market segregation (Tilly 1998). Various social network structures may arise from the actions of self-interested individuals (Watts and Strogatz 1998; Jackson 2006); by incorporating concepts of social capital into an economic framework of profit-maximizing firms, this article develops a model of labor markets in which segregation arises endogenously even though agents are homogeneous and have no dislike for each other. Firms hire through referrals, and can enforce discipline by bribing a referrer to prevent a hiree from getting any outside job offers from other friends if he or she shirks. This is possible only if social networks are reasonably closed, so that the referee knows a majority of his or her friends' friends. By segregating into small communities, workers can more effectively create closed social networks. Social networks with different reservation wages will receive different wages; firms can induce such segregation and wage discrimination in the interest of profit. Workers may not benefit from such segregation, except as a best response to being in a society where it already exists; the "friends" in these social networks act as a worker discipline device, and in this way treat each other inimically.

<title>Incorporating structural stigma into network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2020.05.005</url>
<snippet>A rich literature has explored the modeling of homophily and other forms of nonuniform mixing associated with individual-level covariates within the exponential family random graph (ERGM) framework. Such differential mixing does not fully explain phenomena such as stigma, however, which involve the active maintenance of social boundaries by ostracism of persons with out-group ties. Here, we introduce a new family of statistics that allows for such effects to be captured, making it possible to probe for the potential presence of boundary maintenance above and beyond simple differences in nomination rates. We demonstrate these statistics in the context of gender segregation in a school classroom, and introduce a framework for understanding the associated coefficients via network perturbation.

<title>Modelling and analysis of big data platform group adoption behaviour based on social network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101570</url>
<snippet>Due to the importance of big data technology in decision-making, production and service provision, enterprises have adopted various big data technologies and platforms to improve their operational efficiency. However, the number of enterprises that have adopted big data is not promising. The purpose of this study is to explore the current status of big data adoption by Chinese enterprises and to reveal the possible factors that hinder big data adoption from the group behaviour network perspective. Based on a real case survey of 54 big data platforms (BDPs), four types of networks-i.e., the enterprise-platform network, enterprise network, platform network and industry similarity and difference (ISD) network-are constructed and analysed on the basis of social network analysis (SNA). This study finds that among Chinese enterprises, the level and scope of big data adoption are generally low and are imbalanced among industries; the cognitive level and adoption behaviour of enterprises on BDPs are inconsistent, the compatibility of BDPs is different, and the density and distance-based cohesion of networks are weak; although the current big data adoption behaviours of Chinese enterprises have formed some structural features, core-periphery structures and maximal complete cliques are found, and the current network structure has little impact on individual enterprises and platforms; enterprises in the same industry prefer to adopt the same kind of big data technology or platform. Based on these findings, several strategies and suggestions to improve big data adoption are provided.

<title>Brokerage activity, exclusivity and role diversity: A three-dimensional approach to brokerage in networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.02.014</url>
<snippet>The purpose of this paper is to connect central theoretical contributions to the study of brokerage and propose a novel conceptual and analytical approach for investigating it. On one hand, it builds on, and further substantiate the utility of, the innovation of conceptualizing brokerage activity and brokerage exclusivity separately, whilst analyzing them together. On the other hand, it also builds on the seminal notion of qualitatively different brokerage roles and introduces the conceptual innovation of brokerage role diversity to study the implications of and for actors occupying one or several roles to similar or varying degrees. These implications are further unpacked by analyzing the specific brokerage activity and exclusivity for each brokerage role separately, before reassembling the results into a rich description of the patterns of brokerage among different types of actors. This three-dimensional approach was applied to study brokerage in a network of individual actors governing flood risk mitigation in a catchment area in Southern Sweden. The results suggest that studying these three dimensions of brokerage simultaneously provides a sharper lens that picks up important nuances that available approaches may fail to reveal. The paper makes a substantive contribution to the knowledge of brokerage in collaborative governance of complex issues, as well as a methodological contribution to the study of brokerage in general.

<title>Universal patterns of long-distance commuting and social assortativity in cities</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-00416-1</url>
<snippet>Millions commute to work every day in cities and interact with colleagues, partners, friends, and strangers. Commuting facilitates the mixing of people from distant and diverse neighborhoods, but whether this has an imprint on social inclusion or instead, connections remain assortative is less explored. In this paper, we aim to better understand income sorting in social networks inside cities and investigate how commuting distance conditions the online social ties of Twitter users in the 50 largest metropolitan areas of the United States. An above-median commuting distance in cities is linked to more diverse individual networks, moreover, we find that longer commutes are associated with a nearly uniform, moderate reduction of overall social tie assortativity across all cities. This suggests a universal relation between long-distance commutes and the integration of social networks. Our results inform policy that facilitating access across distant neighborhoods can advance the social inclusion of low-income groups.

<title>Searching for superspreaders of information in real-world social media</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep05547</url>
<snippet>A number of predictors have been suggested to detect the most influential spreaders of information in online social media across various domains such as Twitter or Facebook. In particular, degree, PageRank, k-core and other centralities have been adopted to rank the spreading capability of users in information dissemination media. So far, validation of the proposed predictors has been done by simulating the spreading dynamics rather than following real information flow in social networks. Consequently, only model-dependent contradictory results have been achieved so far for the best predictor. Here, we address this issue directly. We search for influential spreaders by following the real spreading dynamics in a wide range of networks. We find that the widely-used degree and PageRank fail in ranking users' influence. We find that the best spreaders are consistently located in the k-core across dissimilar social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Livejournal and scientific publishing in the American Physical Society. Furthermore, when the complete global network structure is unavailable, we find that the sum of the nearest neighbors' degree is a reliable local proxy for user's influence. Our analysis provides practical instructions for optimal design of strategies for "viral'' information dissemination in relevant applications.

<title>Who teaches and who learns? Policy learning through the C40 cities climate network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11077-012-9159-5</url>
<snippet>This study examines the network structure of policy learning in the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, which is a network of the world's largest cities committed to tackling climate change issues. Among forty members and nineteen affiliate members, we ask the question with whom do cities learn and why? How are policy-learning relationships associated with cities' multi-stakeholder governing body, policy performance, and cultural similarities? While studies on learning have analyzed conditions facilitating learning, quantitative studies of local government learning in global networks are rare. To facilitate the investigation into learning, we conceptualize learning as a process comprising information seeking, adoption and policy change, and focus on information seeking as the foundation step in the learning process. This social network analysis using the exponential random graph model reveals the cities that seek information and those that are information sources are different subgroups. Furthermore, analysis of nodal attributes suggests that transmunicipal learning in the C40 network is facilitated by the presence of a multi-stakeholder governing body; homophily of culture (language and regional proximity); and higher level of climate change policy performance. Creating a multi-stakeholder governing body could ensure participatory representativeness from citizens and relevant stakeholders to enhance climate change policy engagement and decision making as well as policy learning.

<title>Beauty and social capital: Being attractive shapes social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2017.05.003</url>
<snippet>It is a fact of life that being beautiful is advantageous (Hamermesh, 2011). Whether we consider incomes or the marriage market, the more attractive one is, the better one does. Drawing on psychological research that explains why beauty pays, we hypothesize that more attractive people will exploit social network opportunities differently than less attractive people and, consequently, their networks will comprise more beneficial features. As predicted, results of an experiment showed that more attractive people were more likely to select for themselves more profitable broker positions in networks relative to other positions and relative to less attractive people. Relying on network data supplied by young professionals, in a follow-up study we found that the networks of more attractive people were relatively less dense, as the findings of Study 1 would imply. We discuss the implications for our work as well as highlight the need for further research into an understudied, but potentially influential brokerage contingency factor physical appeal.

<title>The Evolution of Online Forums as Communication Networks: An Agent-Based Model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3917/rfs.554.0805</url>
<snippet>This article proposes a theoretical and computational model of how people communicate in online discussion forums. The model's analysis shows that two simple mechanisms can account for the complexity of online communication networks, i.e., a) the tendency to talk with already known users, and b) the tendency to engage in Q&amp;A exchanges. These two mechanisms are able to reproduce lengthy discussions as well as complex interactions between users with different levels of expertise. Most notably, when compared to empirical data taken from three different online forums, the model is able to discern when a strong core of users emerges (or not) that interacts more frequently. Since the evolution of a core of stable interacting users might be the first step in building a community's shared feeling, being able to model the emergence of such core is of interest in a broad range of contexts, from policy-making and e-learning to social marketing.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/271023</url>
<snippet>This paper advances a theoretical method that uses social exchange theory to explain the structure of social networks. I begin to develop this generic method through a specific application. Reformulating Blau's (1964) model of social exchange to reflect the dynamic nature of interaction and the accompanying potential for opportunistic behavior, I demonstrate how social exchange may be formalized as a repeated game, and how game-theoretic models may be used to predict the stability of particular exchange network structures. The specific application offers some evidence of the fruitfulness of the generic theoretical method, providing an explanation for the strong, reciprocal relationships in the workgroup advice network observed by Blau (1955).

<title>Judgment about knowledge importance: the roles of social referents and network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0018726708096638</url>
<snippet>As division of labor in a group can often lead to differences in perceptions about the importance of different knowledge bases to a group task, these differences can hinder the integration of different knowledge to solve task problems in a group. This study examines the social referents that group members turn to for judgments about knowledge importance, and the extent to which the relative influence of each referent depends on the group-level social network structure. The findings indicate that group members are more likely to have shared judgments with their cohesive and structurally equivalent referents within their advice network, and the strength of social influence form their cohesive and structurally equivalent referents is likely to depend on the advice network density at the group-level. However, there was no significant association in judgment similarity between group members and their central referents within the advice network. Overall, this study suggests that while social influence (in its most straightforward form) occurs between pairs of individuals, the strength of influence of a social referent is dependent on how social cues are distributed within the group's network structure. Theoretical and managerial implications for research on shared mental models and network theory of social influence are discussed.

<title>Approximating individual interactions in compartmental system dynamics models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sdr.1599</url>
<snippet>This paper introduces an approach known as a pair approximation developed in physics and mathematical biology that captures some of the effects of network structure in a compartmental system dynamics (CSD) model without substantially increasing model complexity or computational efficiency. We describe the approach using a familiar example: the standard SIS model from epidemiology that underpins many models from the marketing and innovation diffusion literature. We show that the pair approximation better approximates the results of an agent-based simulation than the standard CSD. The model provides insights regarding the epidemic threshold, with implications for halting the spread of a disease or encouraging the spread of a product, that cannot be obtained from the standard CSD. We further illustrate the technique through the development of two new CSD models: a model of social contagion, SIS2, that allows for social recovery, and a model of technology adoption with local network effects.

<title>The Structure of Negative Social Ties in Rural Village Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.15195/v6.a8</url>
<snippet>Negative (antagonistic) connections have been of longstanding theoretical importance for social structure. In a population of 24,696 adults interacting face to face within 176 isolated villages in western Honduras, we measured all connections that were present, amounting to 105,175 positive and 16,448 negative ties. Here, we show that negative and positive ties exhibit many of the same structural characteristics. We then develop a complete taxonomy of all 138 possible triads of two-type relationships. Consistent with balance theory, we find that antagonists of friends and friends of antagonists tend to be antagonists; but, in an important empirical refutation of balance theory, we find that antagonists of antagonists also tend to be antagonists, not friends. Finally, villages with comparable levels of animosity tend to be geographically proximate. Similar processes, involving social contact, give rise to both positive and negative social ties in rural villages, and negative ties play an important role in social structure.

<title>Duocentered networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2007.07.001</url>
<snippet>When a pair of individuals is central to a research problem (e.g., husband and wife, PhD student and supervisor) the concept of "duocentered" networks can be defined as a useful extension of egocentered networks. This new structure consists of a pair of central egos and their direct links with alters, instead of just one central ego as in the egocentered networks or multiple egos as in complete networks. The key point in this kind of network is that ties exist between the central pair of egos and between them and all alters, but the ties among alters are not considered. Duocentered networks can also be considered as a compromise between egocentered and complete networks. Complete network measurements are often costly to obtain and tend to contain a large proportion of missing data (especially for peripheral actors). Egocentered network data are less costly but a lot of information is lost with their use when a pair of individuals is the relevant unit of analysis. From the definition of duocentered networks, we develop new social network measures, some of which based on the measures for complete networks such as degree, closeness centrality or density, both absolute and relative, while others are tailored to dealing with specific characteristics of the duocentered network structures. The proposed measures are used in the analysis of the networks of Slovenian PhD students and their supervisors. We specify three regression models to predict PhD student's academic performance on the basis of these duocentered network measures for different relations such as advice, collaboration, emotional support, and trust. The results show that absolute duocentered measures predict performance best. When compared with egocentered network measures a higher predictive power of duocentered networks is revealed.

<title>Bridging: Locating critical connectors in a network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2010.03.003</url>
<snippet>This paper proposes several measures for bridging in networks derived from Granovetter's (1973) insight that links which reduce distances in a network are important structural bridges. Bridging is calculated by systematically deleting links and calculating the resultant changes in network cohesion (measured as the inverse average path length). The average change for each node's links provides an individual level measure of bridging. We also present a normalized version which controls for network size and a network-level bridging index. Bridging properties are demonstrated on hypothetical networks, empirical networks, and a set of 100 randomly generated networks to show how the bridging measure correlates with existing network measures such as degree, personal network density, constraint, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and vitality. Bridging and the accompanying methodology provide a family of new network measures useful for studying network structure, network dynamics, and network effects on substantive behavioral phenomenon.

<title>Networks of action and events over time. A multilevel discrete-time event history model for longitudinal network data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2010.09.003</url>
<snippet>Longitudinal network data recording the moment at which ties appear, change, or disappear are increasingly available. Event history models can be used to analyze the dynamics of time-stamped network data. This paper adapts the discrete-time event history model to social network data. A discrete-time event history model can easily incorporate a multilevel design and time-varying covariates. A multilevel design is needed to account for dependencies among ties and vertices, which should not be ignored in a small longitudinal network. Time-varying covariates are required to analyze network effects, that is, the impact of previous ties. In addition, a discrete-time event history model handles constraints on who can act or who can be acted upon in a straightforward way. The model can be estimated with multilevel logistic regression analysis, which is illustrated by an application to book reviews, so network evolution can be analyzed with a fairly standard statistical tool.

<title>Measuring changes in interagency collaboration: An examination of the Bridgeport safe start initiative</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2007.04.001</url>
<snippet>This paper describes the evaluation of interagency collaboration in a network of child-serving providers as part of the evaluation of the Bridgeport Safe Start Initiative (BSSI). In line with the system of care approach, the objectives of BSSI included reducing fragmentation of efforts and delivering integrated services to families of young children exposed to or at risk of exposure to family violence. Interagency collaboration was examined via social network and focus group data collected at three time points starting at baseline. Network analysis findings suggest that over time the network structure became consistent with BSSI's vision of an ideal collaborative network structure. Focus group findings, however, present a more complex picture of the status of collaboration. This paper sheds light on approaches and challenges to measuring interagency collaboration in a service delivery system and communicating social network analysis findings to stakeholders in a way that is accessible and useful.

<title>Leveling or tilting the playing field: Social networking sites and offline political communication inequality</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2016.01.002</url>
<snippet>Building on a resource theory, this study investigates (a) how individuals' socio-economic status is related to political communication in offline situations and on social networking sites and (b) whether political expression on SNS improves socio-economic stratification in offline political discussion. Analyses of a national survey demonstrate that the impact of individuals' socio-economic status (SES) is much weaker on political expression via SNS than on offline political discussion. It is also found that the political use of SNS reduces the strength of the link between individuals' SES and offline discussion. Implications of these findings for the Internet and political inequality are discussed. (C) 2016 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<title>Global network structure of dominance hierarchy of ant workers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2014.0599</url>
<snippet>Dominance hierarchy among animals is widespread in various species and believed to serve to regulate resource allocation within an animal group. Unlike small groups, however, detection and quantification of linear hierarchy in large groups of animals are a difficult task. Here, we analyse aggression-based dominance hierarchies formed by worker ants in Diacamma sp. as large directed networks. We show that the observed dominance networks are perfect or approximate directed acyclic graphs, which are consistent with perfect linear hierarchy. The observed networks are also sparse and random but significantly different from networks generated through thinning of the perfect linear tournament (i.e. all individuals are linearly ranked and dominance relationship exists between every pair of individuals). These results pertain to global structure of the networks, which contrasts with the previous studies inspecting frequencies of different types of triads. In addition, the distribution of the out-degree (i.e. number of workers that the focal worker attacks), not in-degree (i.e. number of workers that attack the focal worker), of each observed network is right-skewed. Those having excessively large out-degrees are located near the top, but not the top, of the hierarchy. We also discuss evolutionary implications of the discovered properties of dominance networks.

<title>Static versus Dynamic Topology of Complex Communications Network during Organizational Crisis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cplx.20349</url>
<snippet>The significance of temporal changes in the topology of organizational communication networks during a crisis is studied using static and dynamic social network analysis (SNA). In static SNA, the network of interactions made during an entire data collection period is studied. For dynamic SNA, shorter segments of network data are used in the analysis. Using measures of degree centrality and core-periphery analysis, the prominence of actors is characterized and compared in the aggregate network (i.e., using static topology) and in daily networks (i.e., using dynamic topology) of a complex email network in a large organization during crisis. We show that while static typology cannot capture the network behavior completely, there are particular situations where the additional description provided by dynamic analysis is not significant. The limitations of dynamic topological SNA are discussed and we stress the importance of associating function with network structure in moving towards a more informative dynamical description.

<title>Information Alienation and Circle Fracture: Policy Communication and Opinion-Generating Networks on Social Media in China from the Perspective of COVID-19 Policy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems11070340</url>
<snippet>The emergence of the Internet and social media provides a new platform for information diffusion, promoting the interaction among relatively independent participants in the opinion market and changing the balance of the intrinsic mechanism and external dynamics based on political communication. In this way, it is necessary to investigate the new interactive landscape of political communication and political discourse regarding digital media. In this study, we conduct a social and semantic network analysis of the dissemination and public opinion generation landscape of the COVID-19 "New Ten Articles" policy communication by the Chinese government, exploring the network relationships and emotional value interactions behind the contact of a new public policy in China. The results show that, in the political communication system, the influence of information's position in the communication field has surpassed the information source impact, and the power of network opinion leaders is significant; the policy communication network presents a situation of "identity status circle" division, and the information circle connection presents a trend of fracture and barrier thickening, which may cause policy information alienation and social opinion polarization risk; the imbalance between policy information supply and public demand is further enhanced, and the negative emotion "cloud" is distributed on a scale and condenses into grassroots social governance pressure; and the content released by some key opinion leaders, experts, online media, and local mainstream media accounts is significantly correlated with network emotions. These emotions continue to spread in subsequent discussions, and to some extent, influence the formation process of political public opinion.

<title>Examining Aspects of Digital Inclusion Among National Samples of US Older Adults</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/si.v11i3.6890</url>
<snippet>We live in a world where we are constantly connected to devices (e.g., smartphones, computers, tablets) and are encouraged to go online to find information about most things in society. This constant digital connection provides the means whereby many individuals communicate and exchange social support. For most demographic groups, this results in being online and connected to devices multiple times each day. Older adults have been slower to adopt and use emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs). Their digital divide in comparison to other age groups may not be an accurate representation of their technology use and the reasons for this use. This descriptive study examines this view of digital inclusion by focusing on older adults and their uses of technology. We provide an overview of technology usage by different older adult age groups in the United States using existing national-level data. We utilize life course and aging theoretical perspectives to help articulate how older adults use a wide variety of ICTs and whether they are constantly connected, and we note that while a constant connection to devices may be normative for younger age groups, this may not, and perhaps should not, be the case for older adults. The article concludes with a discussion of the social construction of digital inclusion and emphasizes the significant variation that exists in this construct, measurement of technology use in large-scale datasets, and variation in technology use across older adult life course groups.

<title>The strength of a weak tie in the innovative performance of firms: A case of Korean high-tech manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/soc4.13214</url>
<snippet>This study explores whether the 'strength of weak ties' theory, derived from social network theory, can equally apply to business activities. To address this question, we conduct an empirical analysis, utilising 3-year panel data encompassing 3881 samples of Korean small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the high-tech manufacturing sector. The primary objective is to examine the effects of inter-corporate tie strength on innovative performance. The results reveal an interesting pattern in high-tech manufacturing corporations, where the strength of a tie demonstrates an inverted U-shaped relationship with an SME's patent achievement. Moreover, we observe that the effect of tie strength on an SME's patent achievement is positively moderated by its research and development (R&amp;D) intensity. Furthermore, when an SME maintains weak ties within its relationship with a large corporation, its innovative performance experiences a more positive impact than in cases where no relationship with a large corporation exists, or strong ties are maintained. These findings suggest that for SMEs, maintaining an appropriate level of embeddedness with large corporations is an effective strategy for generating sustained innovative performance within an environment characterised by active technological innovation and intense competition. The principal contribution of this paper lies in the empirical validation of the theory of weak ties concerning a firm's innovative performance.

<title>The ties that bind global governance: Using media-reported events to disentangle the global interorganizational network in a global pandemic</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.02.012</url>
<snippet>This article disentangles the global interorganizational network by analyzing the ties of international actors comprising multinational companies, intergovernmental organizations, and international nongovernmental organizations. The onset of COVID-19 is a rare opportunity to explore how this network has evolved in an exogenous event. Using a unique GDELT big dataset of events reported by the world's media, we extract and analyze the interorganizational interactions of international actors before and after the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the COVID-19 outbreak was a public health emergency of international concern. Adopting an exploratory and descriptive approach at multiple levels of analysis, we draw on the theory of networks to uncover the fragmented, polycentric, and complex characteristics of the global interorganizational network. Our study highlights the use of media-reported events and the Goldstein scale as means to unpack the difficult-to-capture relational dynamics of international actors, which can help in theory development of the global interorganizational network that is crucial for collective action to address societal grand challenges.

<title>Resource sharing in technologically defined social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08935-2</url>
<snippet>Technologically enabled sharing-economy networks are changing the way humans trade and collaborate. Here, using a novel 'Wi-Fi sharing' game, we explored determinants of human sharing strategy. Subjects (N = 1,950) participated in a networked game in which they could choose how to allocate a limited, but personally not usable, resource (representing unused Wi-Fi bandwidth) to immediate network neighbors. We first embedded N = 600 subjects into 30 networks, experimentally manipulating the range over which subjects could connect. We find that denser networks decrease any wealth inequality, but that this effect saturates. Individuals' benefit is shaped by their network position, with having many partners who in turn have few partners being especially beneficial. We propose a new, simplified "sharing centrality" metric for quantifying this. Further experiments (N = 1,200) confirm the robustness of the effect of network structure on sharing behavior. Our findings suggest the possibility of interventions to help more evenly distribute shared resources over networks.

<title>Similarity, familiarity and access to elite work in Hollywood: Employer and employee characteristics in breakthrough employment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0018726708098084</url>
<snippet>This study develops and tests hypotheses concerning factors that influence employers' decisions to create breakthrough opportunities for workers on elite Hollywood projects. A breakthrough is defined as employment in a new career area in which the employee has no experience. Similarity and familiarity are proposed as constructs that describe relationships between employees and employers. Similarity and familiarity play a major role in breakthroughs because, by definition, the employee's experience is insufficient to gauge his or her ability for the new area. The hypotheses are tested using archival data on employment in Hollywood motion picture production, with the breakthrough to directing an elite motion picture as the focal opportunity. The results show that while similarity and familiarity make breakthroughs more likely, the prospect's experience matters little. Breakthrough opportunities are created by employers with less experience in elite work and lower status.

<title>Social context, spatial structure and social network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2010.09.002</url>
<snippet>Frequently, social networks are studied in their own right with analyses devoid of contextual details. Yet contextual features - both social and spatial - can have impacts on the networks formed within them. This idea is explored with five empirical networks representing different contexts and the use of distinct modeling strategies. These strategies include network visualizations, QAP regression, exponential random graph models, blockmodeling and a combination of blockmodels with exponential random graph models within a single framework. We start with two empirical examples of networks inside organizations. The familiar Bank Wiring Room data show that the social organization (social context) and spatial arrangement of the room help account for the social relations formed there. The second example comes from a police academy where two designed arrangements, one social and one spatial, powerfully determine the relational social structures formed by recruits. The next example is an inter-organizational network that emerged as part of a response to a natural disaster where features of the improvised context helped account for the relations that formed between organizations participating in the search and rescue mission. We then consider an anthropological example of signed relations among sub-tribes in the New Guinea highlands where the physical geography is fixed. This is followed by a trading network off the Dalmatian coast where geography and physical conditions matter. Through these examples, we show that context matters by shaping the structure of networks that form and that a variety of network analytic tools can be mobilized to reveal how networks are shaped, in part, by social and spatial contexts. Implications for studying social networks are suggested. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Short- and long-term stability in organizational networks: Temporal structures of project teams</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2013.07.001</url>
<snippet>Network research focuses on patterns of stable relationships, where stability represents the unfolding of social processes over long time frames. We argue that social interactions exhibit important regularities in different time frames (short and long term), reflecting distinct social processes. We illustrate the value of this distinction through a comparative case study of technology-mediated communication, within two project teams in a digital marketing agency. We examine how the embedding of interpersonal interactions in processes of reciprocity and closure over different time horizons enables the emergence of cohesion in the face of constant compositional changes. We propose that the time frames in which stable patterns of interactions develop are the key to understanding the nature of the underlying social processes with short-term patterns of closure and reciprocity representing adaptation to change while longer term patterns indicate cohesion. Our results are supportive of this argument and show that the two teams exhibit the same regularities in interactions but across different time horizons. We discuss the implication of our findings and argue that distinguishing between short- and long-term stability of social networks offers a novel and promising avenue for network research.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2024.08.007</url>
<snippet>The present empirical study aims to explore medical knowledge sharing in the Australian healthcare context, aiming to broadly evaluate the potential impact of Project ECHO (R), (R), an online mentoring and networking health program. We focus on health-related knowledge sharing practices among the network of professionals through formal and informal channels, and across different health and non-health sectors and organisational systems. Studying knowledge transmission among professional networks is essential for optimizing healthcare delivery, promoting innovation, and providing insights on improvement of patient experiences within the healthcare system. We utilize a multilevel approach to shape our data collection strategy. Employing network measures and Multilevel Exponential Random Graph Models, we aim to explore how advice and knowledge sharing behaviours among healthcare professionals and their institutions are interdependently connected. Then, we incorporate network generated results within an evaluation framework for establishing some aspects of the efficiency of the ECHO program along four pillars: Acceptability, , Capability, , Reachability, , and Integration. . Our investigation found that among ECHO members, hierarchy is less pronounced compared to across levels and organizations, with certain individuals emerging as central in advice-sharing. The multilevel network perspective showed complex, informal patterns of knowledge and information sharing, including inter-organizational hierarchy, role and sector homophily, brokerage roles with popularity across health organizations, and connectivity through knowledge-sharing in cross-level small group clusters.

<title>Human social preferences cluster and spread in the field</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2000824117</url>
<snippet>While it is undeniable that the ability of humans to cooperate in large-scale societies is unique in animal life, it remains open how such a degree of prosociality is possible despite the risks of exploitation. Recent evidence suggests that social networks play a crucial role in the development of prosociality and large-scale cooperation by allowing cooperators to cluster; however, it is not well understood if and how this also applies to real-world social networks in the field. We study intrinsic social preferences alongside emerging friendship patterns in 57 freshly formed school classes (n = 1,217), using incentivized measures. We demonstrate the existence of cooperative clusters in society, examine their emergence, and expand the evidence from controlled experiments to real-world social networks. Our results suggest that being embedded in cooperative environments substantially enhances the social preferences of individuals, thus contributing to the formation of cooperative clusters. Partner choice, in contrast, only marginally contributes to their emergence. We conclude that cooperative preferences are contagious; social and cultural learning plays an important role in the development and evolution of cooperation.

<title>Collective Influence of Multiple Spreaders Evaluated by Tracing Real Information Flow in Large-Scale Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep36043</url>
<snippet>Identifying the most influential spreaders that maximize information flow is a central question in network theory. Recently, a scalable method called "Collective Influence (CI)" has been put forward through collective influence maximization. In contrast to heuristic methods evaluating nodes' significance separately, CI method inspects the collective influence of multiple spreaders. Despite that CI applies to the influence maximization problem in percolation model, it is still important to examine its efficacy in realistic information spreading. Here, we examine real-world information flow in various social and scientific platforms including American Physical Society, Facebook, Twitter and LiveJournal. Since empirical data cannot be directly mapped to ideal multi-source spreading, we leverage the behavioral patterns of users extracted from data to construct "virtual" information spreading processes. Our results demonstrate that the set of spreaders selected by CI can induce larger scale of information propagation. Moreover, local measures as the number of connections or citations are not necessarily the deterministic factors of nodes' importance in realistic information spreading. This result has significance for rankings scientists in scientific networks like the APS, where the commonly used number of citations can be a poor indicator of the collective influence of authors in the community.

<title>Assessing information-sharing networks within small-scale fisheries and the implications for conservation interventions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211240</url>
<snippet>The effectiveness of behavioural interventions in conservation often depends on local resource users' underlying social interactions. However, it remains unclear to what extent differences in related topics of information shared between resource users can alter network structure-holding implications for information flows and the spread of behaviours. Here, we explore the differences in nine subtopics of fishing information related to the planned expansion of a community co-management scheme aiming to reduce sea turtle bycatch at a small-scale fishery in Peru. We show that the general network structure detailing information sharing about sea turtle bycatch is dissimilar from other fishing information sharing. Specifically, no significant degree assortativity (degree homophily) was identified, and the variance in node eccentricity was lower than expected under our null models. We also demonstrate that patterns of information sharing between fishers related to sea turtle bycatch are more similar to information sharing about fishing regulations, and vessel technology and maintenance, than to information sharing about weather, fishing activity, finances and crew management. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing information-sharing networks in contexts directly relevant to the desired intervention and demonstrate the identification of social contexts that might be more or less appropriate for information sharing related to planned conservation actions.

<title>Drawing or tabulating ego-centered networks? A mixed-methods comparison of questionnaire vs. visualization-based data collection</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2016.1227649</url>
<snippet>There is an increasing body of research which examines the reliability and validity of different modes of network measurement with most studies focusing on the classical paper or digital network questionnaires. Visual methods of data collection, in which interviewees draw their ego-centered network in a pictorial representation, still live a kind of shadowy existence in the field of network research, with little known about data quality of these approaches. In this paper, the classic approach of questionnaire data collection will be compared to the digital-visual method (VennMaker) in a parallel study design. Similar name generator and interpreter questions were used to collect network data from 264 young adults. Two participants from both studies participated in follow-up qualitative interviews to understand the advantages and disadvantages of data collection modes. Network measures of size, composition and density with additional information on the subjective importance of relations within the network were collected. Results indicate relevant differences between both network methods. These emerge due to the differential effect of the name generator in the visual approach, the specific display of the study material, and the particular limitations of space and effort each method entails. In-depth interviews shed light on subjective strategies (such as gestalt and distancing-and-selecting strategies) in order to cope with the distinct methodical tasks.

<title>Kudos make you run! How runners influence each other on the online social network Strava</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.10.001</url>
<snippet>Strava is the largest online social network for athletes. We used Strava's big data to investigate how runners in the same virtual Strava club influenced each other's running behavior. We hypothesized that receiving kudos on recorded activities would spur exercise rates, and that the running behavior of clubmates to whom ego gave kudos would serve as a motivational example. We focused on five different Strava clubs that functioned as a virtual extension of real-life Dutch running clubs with a total of 329 members. Using data on kudos and recorded activities, we constructed a longitudinal dataset of complete networks and behavior over 11 periods with a one -month time window. We tested our hypotheses using SIENA. We found that receiving kudos induced runners to run more and more often. Moreover, athletes tended to adjust their running behavior to that of their 'kudos -friends' (i.e., those to whom they gave kudos). Contrary to our expectation, kudos-friends who ran more and more often than ego were not the most influential. If anything, the reverse was true; athletes were more likely to come to resemble the running behavior of their kudos-friends who ran less and less often.

<title>Do Women Suffer from Network Closure? The Moderating Effect of Social Capital on Gender Inequality in a Project-Based Labor Market, 1929 to 2010</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122414568788</url>
<snippet>That social capital matters is an established fact in the social sciences. Less clear, however, is how different forms of social capital affect gender disadvantages in career advancement. Focusing on a project-based type of labor market, namely the U.S. film industry, this study argues that women suffer a "closure penalty" and face severe career disadvantages when collaborating in cohesive teams. At the same time, gender disadvantages are reduced for women who build social capital in open networks with higher degrees of diversity and information flow. Using large-scale longitudinal data on career profiles of about one million performances by 97,657 film actors in 369,099 film productions between the years 1929 and 2010, I analyze career survival models and interaction effects between gender and different measures of social capital and information openness. Findings reveal that female actors have a higher risk of career failure than do their male colleagues when affiliated in cohesive networks, but women have better survival chances when embedded in open, diverse structures. This study contributes to the understanding of how and what type of social capital can be either a beneficial resource for otherwise disadvantaged groups or a constraining mechanism that intensifies gender differences in career advancement.

<snippet>The article analyses the role of religious brokerage, arguing for the importance of cultural and social capital. A city like Barcelona is a place of arrival and settlement for a population with diverse trajectories. We see the urban environment as a cultural as well as a social attribute of the activity of religious brokerage. Our case studies are three religious communities in the city: Muslim Pakistani, Sikh and Philippine Catholic. Based on research using a mixed methodology, combining semi-structured interviews, observation and social network analysis (SNA), we look at the spaces where mediation occurs and the composition of the mediators' personal networks. The results obtained lead us to consider sense of place and sociability as necessary aspects of religious brokerage.

<title>Online News Media Analysis on Information Management of "G20 Summit" Based on Social Network Analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems11060290</url>
<snippet>This paper contributes to the Special Issue on Communication for the Digital Media Age by investigating the factors that influence the management of political information on online news media platforms, specifically Twitter and Weibo. Using the recent "G20 Summit" as a case study, this study employs a mixed-methods approach that incorporates both deductive and inductive reasoning. Social network analysis (SNA) and graph theory are used to evaluate specific social relationships in the context of the G20 summit, while a combination of structured and content (semantic) analysis is performed. The findings indicate that individual power is becoming increasingly important in the age of online news media. Individuals contribute significantly to the diffusion of information and may play a decisive role in the future. The study also finds that the frequency of retweets increases as the reciprocity ratio increases, and mentions may be the most effective method for delivering political news on online news media platforms. Practical implications suggest strategies for managing information diffusion effectively. Additionally, this study provides insights into effective information diffusion on online news media platforms that can be utilized in health communication management during the COVID-19 era. This study expands theoretical understanding by investigating the role of individual power in the age of online news media and enriching the literature on online news media through the use of structured and content analysis based on social network analysis.

<title>Bridging the parochial divide: Outsider brokerage in mafia families</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2023.102913</url>
<snippet>How do groups maintain internal solidarity and closure without compromising their access to diverse networks? A long line of previous research suggests focusing on the boundary-spanning activities of "brokers" who bridge gaps in social structure. In many contexts, however, brokers are viewed with suspicion and distrust rather than rewarded for their diversity of interests. This article examines groups in which the theoretical deck is seemingly stacked against brokerage and toward parochialism: American-Italian mafia families. Through an institutional analysis of the mafia organization, I trace how ethnic and organizational closure led marginalized actors to seek alternative paths to enrichment beyond the family-controlled networks and industries. Using a historical network data set, I document a division of network labor in which ethnic outsiders- more than other actors-benefited as bridges between parochial organizations. This illuminates a broader paradox of social organization: while social closure is typically thought important because it increases the group's power over individual members and reinforces boundaries, it can also undermine those same boundaries by pushing marginal actors to seek opportunities and connections outside the group.

<title>Climate-Change Communication Within Public Natural Resource Agencies: Lessons Learned From the US Forest Service</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2015.1107790</url>
<snippet>By analyzing interview and survey data from U.S. Forest Service employees, we examined the strategies used for communicating about climate change within the agency and their effectiveness from the perspective of agency employees. We found a limited awareness among employees regarding climate policy. We found that horizontal information flow through informal social networks was an important way in which climate-change information was communicated. We also found a lack of confidence among employees in their ability to provide feedback to agency leadership. Our results suggest that (1) agency leadership's ability to set priorities and deliver positive vision is important for increasing employee awareness and inspiring actions, (2) the agency could play a role in facilitating formal and informal networking among employees, and (3) using advanced information technologies may contribute to information flow horizontally and vertically, formally and informally.

<title>Team efficiency and network structure: The case of professional League of Legends</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.03.004</url>
<snippet>Teams can be defined by their interactions and successful performance rests on their members' behaviour. Although this topic has been studied both in sports and management, research on computer mediated team interactions, communication, cooperative work and efficiency in online competitive environments is scarce. In this article, networks will be used as a novel approach to understand how League of Legends professional players assist each other during a competitive match and to link their computer mediated behaviour and social interactions to their teams performance. Starting from a dataset consisting of 453.386 kill assists, the network structure and efficiency is assessed over 7.582 matches in total. After controlling for potential mixed-effects, such as the quality of the involved teams or their geography, this study reinforces previous research showing that team efficiency in the League of Legends professional scene is positively affected by the intensity of their interaction while centralization of resources is detrimental. Networks with high intensity and low inner centralization are, therefore, related to a higher performance as a team not only in traditional sports but also in computer mediated contexts.

<title>Modeling and Analyzing Information Propagation Evolution Integrating Internal and External Influences</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adts.202300845</url>
<snippet>Online social networks have revolutionized communication, providing individuals with platforms to express their personal opinions on diverse topics. Researchers have independently explored information propagation and opinion evolution within complex networks. However, these phenomena exhibit interconnectedness, where information dissemination influences opinion evolution and vice versa. To address challenges in complex network modeling and opinion-information coupling, internal and external factors are considered in public opinion scenarios by incorporating the crowd effect, enhancement effect, and evolutionary game theory. The susceptible-latent-forwarding-immune-Jager-Amblard (SLFI-JA) model is presented by modifying the SLFI propagation dynamics model and the JA opinion dynamics model, enabling the integration of information propagation and opinion evolution at the microlevel. Through analyzing real-world social hotspots on Sina Weibo, case studies and comparative analyses are conducted to validate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed model. Furthermore, the findings identify key factors influencing public opinion dissemination and group opinion evolution, offering valuable insights to relevant departments in public opinion response and management. The study aims to mitigate the harmful effects of negative public opinions, prevent extreme adverse online events, and foster a healthier online environment. Online social networks have revolutionized communication, providing individuals with platforms to express opinions on diverse topics. Through considering internal and external factors, the SLFI-JA model is presented, enabling the integration of information propagation and opinion evolution at the micro-level.image

<title>Collective communication and behaviour in response to uncertain 'Danger' in network experiments</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2019.0685</url>
<snippet>In emergencies, social coordination is especially challenging. People connected with each other may respond better or worse to an uncertain danger than isolated individuals. We performed experiments involving a novel scenario simulating an unpredictable situation faced by a group in which 2480 subjects in 108 groups had to both communicate information and decide whether to 'evacuate'. We manipulated the permissible sorts of interpersonal communication and varied group topology and size. Compared to groups of isolated individuals, we find that communication networks suppress necessary evacuations because of the spontaneous and diffuse emergence of false reassurance; yet, communication networks also restrain unnecessary evacuations in situations without disasters. At the individual level, subjects have thresholds for responding to social information that are sensitive to the negativity, but not the actual accuracy, of the signals being transmitted. Social networks can function poorly as pathways for inconvenient truths that people would rather ignore.

<title>Communication in Online Social Networks Fosters Cultural Isolation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/9502872</url>
<snippet>Online social networks play an increasingly important role in communication between friends, colleagues, business partners, and family members. This development sparked public and scholarly debate about how these new platforms affect dynamics of cultural diversity. Formal models of cultural dissemination are powerful tools to study dynamics of cultural diversity but they are based on assumptions that represent traditional dyadic, face-to-face communication, rather than communication in online social networks. Unlike in models of face-to-face communication, where actors update their cultural traits after being influenced by one of their network contacts, communication in online social networks is often characterized by a one-to-many structure, in that users emit messages directly to a large number of network contacts. Using analytical tools and agent-based simulation, we show that this seemingly subtle difference can have profound implications for emergent dynamics of cultural dissemination. In particular, we show that within the framework of our model online communication fosters cultural diversity to a larger degree than offline communication and it increases chances that individuals and subgroups become culturally isolated from their network contacts.

<snippet>To detect and study cohesive subgroups of actors is a main objective in social network analysis. What are the respective relations inside such groups and what separates them from the outside. Entropy-based analysis of network structures is an up-and-coming approach. It turns out to be a powerful instrument to detect certain forms of cohesive subgroups and to compress them to superactors without loss of information about their embeddedness in the net: Compressing strongly connected subgroups leaves the whole net's and the (super-)actors' information theoretical indices unchanged; i.e., such compression is information-invariant. The actual article relates on the reduction of networks with hundreds of actors. All entropy-based calculations are realized in an expert system shell.

<title>How prepared are we for cross-border outbreaks? An exploratory analysis of cross-border response networks for outbreaks of multidrug resistant microorganisms in the Netherlands and Germany</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219548</url>
<snippet>Background The emergence and spread of multidrug resistant microorganisms is a serious threat to transnational public health. Therefore, it is vital that cross-border outbreak response systems are constantly prepared for fast, rigorous, and efficient response. This research aims to improve transnational collaboration by identifying, visualizing, and exploring two cross-border response networks that are likely to unfold during outbreaks involving the Netherlands and Germany. Methods Quantitative methods were used to explore response networks during a cross-border outbreak of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae in healthcare settings. Eighty-six Dutch and German health professionals reflected on a fictive but realistic outbreak scenario (response rate approximate to 70&#37;). Data were collected regarding collaborative relationships between stakeholders during outbreak response, prior working relationships, and trust in the networks. Network analysis techniques were used to analyze the networks on the network level (density, centralization, clique structures, and similarity of tie constellations between two networks) and node level (brokerage measures and degree centrality). Results Although stakeholders mainly collaborate with stakeholders belonging to the same country, transnational collaboration is present in a centralized manner. Integration of the network is reached, since several actors are beneficially positioned to coordinate transnational collaboration. However, levels of trust are moderately low and prior-existing cross-border working relationships are sparse. Conclusion Given the explored network characteristics, we conclude that the system has a promising basis to achieve effective coordination. However, future research has to determine what kind of network governance form might be most effective and efficient in coordinating the necessary cross-border response activity. Furthermore, networks identified in this study are not only crucial in times of outbreak containment, but should also be fostered in times of non-crisis.

<title>Quantifying social group evolution</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature05670</url>
<snippet>The rich set of interactions between individuals in society(1-7) results in complex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends, families or professional cliques in a social network(3,7-10). Thanks to frequent changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution(7,11-16). Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and self-optimization of society as a whole(17-22). We have developed an algorithm based on clique percolation(23,24) that allows us to investigate the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale, and thus uncover basic relationships characterizing community evolution. Our focus is on networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist for longer if they are capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to change the group composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small groups displays the opposite tendency - the condition for stability is that their composition remains unchanged. We also show that knowledge of the time commitment of members to a given community can be used for estimating the community's lifetime. These findings offer insight into the fundamental differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.

<snippet>Although many international students experience transitional issues, most research assumes these issues will disappear over time. Using principles of social capital theory, this study addressed whether after three years of study students were able to build multi-national and host social capital links. In this quantitative study of 81 students from 28 nationalities, the results indicate that Confucian Asian students lived in separate social worlds, while English and other international students developed substantial multi-national networks over time. Learning networks after 14weeks were predicted by group allocation and initial friendships, indicating a positive effect of mixing multi-national groups.

<title>The structure of risk-sharing networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00181-021-02037-z</url>
<snippet>We examine the structure of risk-sharing networks in developing countries using data from the Tanzanian village of Nyakatoke. We first show that the Nyakatoke network exhibits: (1) the "small-world" phenomenon, where two households who are not themselves risk-sharing partners are separated only by a short chain of intermediaries; (2) preferential attachment, which is a network formation process where the probability of a household receiving a partner is proportional to that household's existing number of partners; and (3) assortative mixing, as similarly connected households tend to link to each other. We then examine the implications of these features for network performance by comparing the Nyakatoke network to simulated networks with alternative structural traits. Our simulations show that the Nyakatoke network displays optimal or near-optimal performance along multiple dimensions. In particular, the Nyakatoke network has a notable ability to withstand perturbations of multiple types, a property that none of the counterfactual networks possess.

<title>A Methodology for Evaluating Algorithms That Calculate Social Influence in Complex Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/1084795</url>
<snippet>Online social networks are complex systems often involving millions or even billions of users. Understanding the dynamics of a social network requires analysing characteristics of the network (in its entirety) and the users (as individuals). This paper focuses on calculating user's social influence, which depends on (i) the user's positioning in the social network and (ii) interactions between the user and all other users in the social network. Given that data on all users in the social network is required to calculate social influence, something not applicable for today's social networks, alternative approaches relying on a limited set of data on users are necessary. However, these approaches introduce uncertainty in calculating (i.e., predicting) the value of social influence. Hence, a methodology is proposed for evaluating algorithms that calculate social influence in complex social networks; this is done by identifying the most accurate and precise algorithm. The proposed methodology extends the traditional ground truth approach, often used in descriptive statistics and machine learning. Use of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using a case study incorporating four algorithms for calculating a user's social influence.

<title>Volume explored by a branching random walk on general graphs</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51225-6</url>
<snippet>Branching processes are used to model diverse social and physical scenarios, from extinction of family names to nuclear fission. However, for a better description of natural phenomena, such as viral epidemics in cellular tissues, animal populations and social networks, a spatial embedding-the branching random walk (BRW)-is required. Despite its wide range of applications, the properties of the volume explored by the BRW so far remained elusive, with exact results limited to one dimension. Here we present analytical results, supported by numerical simulations, on the scaling of the volume explored by a BRW in the critical regime, the onset of epidemics, in general environments. Our results characterise the spreading dynamics on regular lattices and general graphs, such as fractals, random trees and scale-free networks, revealing the direct relation between the graphs' dimensionality and the rate of propagation of the viral process. Furthermore, we use the BRW to determine the spectral properties of real social and metabolic networks, where we observe that a lack of information of the network structure can lead to differences in the observed behaviour of the spreading process. Our results provide observables of broad interest for the characterisation of real world lattices, tissues, and networks.

<title>The distribution of initial estimates moderates the effect of social influence on the wisdom of the crowd</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20551-7</url>
<snippet>Whether, and under what conditions, groups exhibit "crowd wisdom" has been a major focus of research across the social and computational sciences. Much of this work has focused on the role of social influence in promoting the wisdom of the crowd versus leading the crowd astray and has resulted in conflicting conclusions about how social network structure determines the impact of social influence. Here, we demonstrate that it is not enough to consider the network structure in isolation. Using theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and reanalysis of four experimental datasets (totaling 2885 human subjects), we find that the wisdom of crowds critically depends on the interaction between (i) the centralization of the social influence network and (ii) the distribution of the initial individual estimates. By adopting a framework that integrates both the structure of the social influence and the distribution of the initial estimates, we bring previously conflicting results under one theoretical framework and clarify the effects of social influence on the wisdom of crowds.

<title>Environmental disturbance increases social connectivity in a passerine bird</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183144</url>
<snippet>Individual level response to natural and anthropogenic disturbance represents an increasingly important, but as yet little understood, component of animal behavior. Disturbance events often alter habitat, which in turn can modify behaviors of individuals in affected areas, including changes in habitat use and associated changes in social structure. To better understand these relationships, we investigated aspects of habitat selection and social connectivity of a small passerine bird, the red-backed fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus), before vs. after naturally occurring fire disturbance in Northern Territory, Australia. We utilized a social network framework to evaluate changes in social dynamics pre-vs. post-fire. Our study covered the non-breeding season in two consecutive years in which fires occurred, and individuals whose habitat was affected and those that were not affected by fire. Individuals in habitat affected by fires had stronger social ties (i.e. higher weighted degree) after fires, while those that were in areas that were not affected by fire actually had lower weighted degree. We suggest that this change in social connections may be linked to habitat. Before fires, fairywrens used habitat that had similar grass cover to available habitat plots randomly generated within our study site. Fire caused a reduction in grass cover, and fairywrens responded by selecting habitat with higher grass cover relative to random plots. This study demonstrates how changes in habitat and/or resource availability caused by disturbance can lead to substantive changes in the social environment that individuals experience.

<title>BERNOULLI GRAPH BOUNDS FOR GENERAL RANDOM GRAPHS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9531.2011.01246.x</url>
<snippet>General random graphs (i.e., stochastic models/or networks incorporating heterogeneity and/or dependence among edges) are increasingly in wide use in the study of social and other networks, but Jew techniques other than simulation have been available for studying their behavior. On the other hand, random graphs with independent edges (i.e., the Bernoulli graphs) are well-studied, and a large literature exists regarding their properties. In this paper, we demonstrate a method for leveraging this knowledge by constructing families of Bernoulli graphs that bound the behavior of an arbitrary random graph in a well-defined sense. By studying the behavior of these Bernoulli graph bounds, we can thus constrain the properties of a given random graph. We illustrate the utility of this approach via application to several problems from the social network literature, including identifying degeneracy in Markov graph models, studying the potential impact of tie formation mechanisms on epidemic potential in sexual contact networks, and robustness testing of inhomogeneous Bernoulli models based on geographical covariates. Practical heuristics for assessing bound tightness and guidance for use in theoretical and methodological applications are also discussed.

<title>Modeling and analyzing network dynamics of COVID-19 vaccine information propagation in the Chinese Sina Microblog</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-024-09386-x</url>
<snippet>Information about the vaccine is usually spread through heterogeneous networks in reality, where public opinion bursts out faster than in homogeneous networks. Considering the complexity of heterogeneous networks, we develop a network susceptible-forwarding-immune (NET-SFI) model to describe the patterns of information propagation in the actual social network. Classifying the states of nodes according to the number of users can contact in the social network, the NET-SFI model focuses on the network structure and user heterogeneity. We adopt a data-model drive method to conduct the model validation including two types of COVID-19 vaccine information from the Chinese Sina Microblog. Our parameter sensitivity analyses show the important significance of node degree in causing the outbreak of public opinion. Moreover, corresponding conclusions based on our analytic study are conducive to designing valid strategies for vaccine information dissemination.

<title>The social structure of trust</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-8733(98)00005-7</url>
<snippet>This paper addresses the way in which the level of trust in cooperative relations depends on network structures. The study is an elaboration of models developed in earlier papers using iterated games [Weesie, J., Buskens, V., Raub, W., 1998. The management of trust relations via institutional and structural embeddedness. Journal of Mathematical Sociology (in press); Buskens, V., 1995. Social Networks and the Effect of Reputation on Cooperation. ISCORE Paper No. 42, Utrecht University]. We distinguish individual and group network measures. Applying a combination of approximation methods to the game-theoretic solution to the model, we derive hypotheses on the effects of density, outdegree centrality, and centralization on the level of trust a truster can have in a trustee. We conclude that higher density and outdegree induce more trust. Centralization increases trust if it is 'well organized,' i.e., actors who can place more trust are central in the network. Furthermore, we discuss theoretical evidence that the relative importance of density compared to outdegree increases if the trust problem at the dyadic level is large. Finally, we show that, in many situations, a few simple network measures explain most of the effects of the network structure as a whole. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Social network structure and composition in former NFL football players</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80091-w</url>
<snippet>Social networks have broad effects on health and quality of life. Biopsychosocial factors may also modify the effects of brain trauma on clinical and pathological outcomes. However, social network characterization is missing in studies of contact sports athletes. Here, we characterized the personal social networks of former National Football League players compared to non-football US males. In 303 former football players and 269 US males, we found that network structure (e.g., network size) did not differ, but network composition (e.g., proportion of family versus friends) did differ. Football players had more men than women, and more friends than family in their networks compared to US males. Black players had more racially diverse networks than White players and US males. These results are unexpected because brain trauma and chronic illnesses typically cause diminished social relationships. We anticipate our study will inform more multi-dimensional study of, and treatment options for, contact sports athletes. For example, the strong allegiances of former athletes may be harnessed in the form of social network interventions after brain trauma. Because preserving health of contact sports athletes is a major goal, the study of social networks is critical to the design of future research and treatment trials.

<title>Interagency collaboration within the city emergency management network: a case study of Super Ministry Reform in China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/disa.12495</url>
<snippet>Emergencies continue to become ever more complex; responding to them, therefore, often is beyond the capabilities and capacities of any single public agency. Hence, collaboration among these actors is necessary to prepare for, respond to, and recover from such events. This seldom occurs in an effective or efficient manner, however. Drawing on resource dependence theory and the concept of social capital, this paper reveals that different types of collaborative relationships exist within the collaborative network. Super Ministry Reform of Emergency Management in China serves as a case in point. By evaluating network efficiency and classifying the collaborative relationships of involved government agencies, four types are identified: resource-redundant; resource-complementary; resource-dependent; and resource-isolated. The different influences of collaborative relationships explain why the reform is not that effective, although it has led to the merger of several core departments in the emergency management network. The findings are a reminder to consider network structure and collaboration types when engaging in institutional design.

<title>A Tale of Many Cities: Universal Patterns in Human Urban Mobility</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0037027</url>
<snippet>The advent of geographic online social networks such as Foursquare, where users voluntarily signal their current location, opens the door to powerful studies on human movement. In particular the fine granularity of the location data, with GPS accuracy down to 10 meters, and the worldwide scale of Foursquare adoption are unprecedented. In this paper we study urban mobility patterns of people in several metropolitan cities around the globe by analyzing a large set of Foursquare users. Surprisingly, while there are variations in human movement in different cities, our analysis shows that those are predominantly due to different distributions of places across different urban environments. Moreover, a universal law for human mobility is identified, which isolates as a key component the rank-distance, factoring in the number of places between origin and destination, rather than pure physical distance, as considered in some previous works. Building on our findings, we also show how a rank-based movement model accurately captures real human movements in different cities.

<title>How conversational ties are formed in an online community: a social network analysis of a tweet chat group</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1581242</url>
<snippet>This paper examines the generative processes underlying the conversational network structure of a tweet chat community (#dsma, 'Diabetes Social Media Advocacy'). Taking a relational perspective to the study of mediated communication, this paper uses social network analysis and treats conversational ties as the unit of analysis. It explores the formation of such ties in a multitheoretical, multilevel framework via exponential random graph modeling (ERGM). Twitter network data on #dsma from a two-year period (2015-2017) were analyzed. Results showed that similar to offline relationship formation observed in previous research, this online conversational community also emerged from a combination of social processes (including attribute-based social selection and endogenous network self-organization) that occurred at individual, dyadic, and triadic levels. This study contributes empirical insights into relational dynamics underlying online networks and encourages future research on mediated communication as an emergent, interdependent process involving multifaceted, multilevel mechanisms.

<title>What types of brokerage bridge the research-practice gap? The case of public school educators</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.05.006</url>
<snippet>The presence of a research-practice gap is recognized across multiple fields including education, psychology, and public health. In this paper, we examine which of five structural types of brokerage are most and least effective in bridging this research-practice gap in the context of education. Using a small world survey design, we tracked how a statewide random sample of 247 K-12 principals and superintendents in Michigan seek information about social skills programs from brokering individuals and organizations. We find that some triadic brokerage structures are more effective than others in closing the communication gap between practitioners and researchers. Specifically, educators relying on itinerant brokerage, which circulates information between members of the same community, were five times less likely to obtain information from a researcher. In contrast, educators relying on representative or liaison brokerage, which facilitate information transfer between members of different communities, were more than twice as likely to obtain information from a researcher. We conclude by discussing implications for the development of interventions designed to facilitate information sharing between practitioners and researchers.

<title>Uncovering nodes that spread information between communities in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-014-0026-9</url>
<snippet>From many datasets gathered in online social networks, well defined community structures have been observed. A large number of users participate in these networks and the size of the resulting graphs poses computational challenges. There is a particular demand in identifying the nodes responsible for information flow between communities; for example, in temporal Twitter networks edges between communities play a key role in propagating spikes of activity when the connectivity between communities is sparse and few edges exist between different clusters of nodes. The new algorithm proposed here is aimed at revealing these key connections by measuring a node's vicinity to nodes of another community. We look at the nodes which have edges in more than one community and the locality of nodes around them which influence the information received and broadcasted to them. The method relies on independent random walks of a chosen fixed number of steps, originating from nodes with edges in more than one community. For the large networks that we have in mind, existing measures such as betweenness centrality are difficult to compute, even with recent methods that approximate the large number of operations required. We therefore design an algorithm that scales up to the demand of current big data requirements and has the ability to harness parallel processing capabilities. The new algorithm is illustrated on synthetic data, where results can be judged carefully, and also on a real, large scale Twitter activity data, where new insights can be gained.

<snippet>I develop and analyze a mathematical model describing the relationship between individual contributions to a collective good and the network of social relations that makes these contributions interdependent. Starting from the assumption that actors respond to the contributions of others because of efficacy concerns and norms of fairness, I derive predictions about the impact of network structure on total contributions. Network density and size influence collective action outcomes in dramatically different ways, depending on the structural position of those who make unconditional contributions. Moreover these effects are highly nonlinear suggesting that the impact of social ties on collective action may be quite sensitive to mobilization contexts.

<snippet>In the first part of this paper I present original survey data which suggests that the transition from further to higher education, or more specifically the process of becoming a university student, has a politicising effect upon some students. In particular, university students are more likely that their 6th form counter-parts to have engaged in some of the forms of protest activity associated with social movements. This holds even during periods when levels of social movement mobilisation are low both on and off campus. In the second part of the paper I review several of the key theoretical explanations of student politicisation to be found in the social movements literature. Having criticised these theories and noted that they are challenged by my survey findings, I outline an alternative which focuses upon campus-based social networks. University campuses, I suggest, facilitate the formation of a critical and connected mass of previously politicised actors who then use their further networks to recruit political novices into activism. It is this recruitment activity, which is greatly enhanced by the network structure of campus life, which explains the politicising effect of campus life. Moreover, insofar as new recruits go on to become recruiters this forms part of a self-perpetuating dynamic of politicisation.

<title>Opinion dynamics in social networks under competition: the role of influencing factors in consensus-reaching</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211732</url>
<snippet>The rapid development of information technology and social media has provided easy access to the vast data on individual preferences and social interactions. Despite a series of problems, such as privacy disclosure and data sensitivity, it cannot be denied that this access also provides beneficial opportunities and convenience for campaigns involving opinion control (e.g. marketing campaigns and political election). The profitability of opinion and the finiteness of individual attention have already spawned extensive competition for individual preferences on social networks. It is necessary to investigate opinion dynamics over social networks in a competitive environment. To this end, this paper develops a novel social network DeGroot model based on competition game (DGCG) to characterize opinion evolution in a competitive opinion dynamics. Social interactions based on trust relationships are captured in the DGCG model. From the model, we then obtain equilibrium results in a stable state of opinion evolution. We also analyse what role relevant factors play in the final consensus and competitive outcomes, including the resource ratio of both contestants, initial opinions, self-confidence and network structure. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations show that these factors can significantly sway the consensus and even reverse competition outcomes.
