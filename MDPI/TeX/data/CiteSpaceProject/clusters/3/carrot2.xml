<title>The Embeddedness of Teachers' Social Networks: Evidence from a Study of Mathematics Reform</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0038040713501147</url>
<snippet>Teachers' social networks can play an important role in teacher learning and organizational change. But what influences teachers' networks? Why do some teachers have networks that are likely to support individual and organizational change, while others do not? This study is a first step in answering this question. We focus on how district policy influences the quality and configuration of teachers' social networks. We draw on a longitudinal, qualitative study of implementation of a mathematics curriculum in four schools. We show that district policy (1) shaped the tie formation process, influencing the structure of networks; (2) mobilized resources that teachers subsequently accessed via their networks, influencing the benefits accrued through network exchanges; and (3) introduced interaction routines that interrupted conventional ways that teachers talked together. We thus uncover heretofore unexplored facets of network formation and change. We also provide insight into dimensions of social networks that are amenable to outside intervention.

<title>China's non-ferrous metal recycling technology convergence and driving factors: A quadratic assignment procedure analysis based on patent collaboration-based network structural hole</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0271694</url>
<snippet>Technological convergence is an important organizational innovation capability, essential for improving the core competitiveness of green and sustainable industries. However, studies have mainly focused on measuring technological convergence and have ignored the factors that affect the capabilities of such convergence capabilities. Thus, this study attempts to bridge this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of the impact of structural holes in inter-organizational technical cooperation networks. This technological convergence is studied from the perspective of a patent. It also considers the moderating effects of the degree of patent cooperation and the cooperation distance. It employs the social network theory to construct inter-organizational patent cooperation, and technological convergence networks, to facilitate the analysis of the effect of structural holes on such a convergence. It empirically examines 52 non-ferrous metal recycling organizations, with close patent cooperation. Accordingly, the structural hole constraint index by the inter-organizational patent cooperation network, shows a positive U-shaped curve relationship with technology convergence. Moreover, the degree of inter-organizational patent cooperation strengthens the positive U-shaped relationship, and the distance of cooperation weakens the influence of the structural hole constraint index on technology convergence. Therefore, managers and policymakers should encourage more industry-academia-research or patent alliances and designate policies to promote such cooperation.

<title>New on the Block: Analyzing Network Selection Trajectories in a Prison Treatment Program</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122420941021</url>
<snippet>Personal network change is largely driven by transitions between the groups and organizations where people spend their day-to-day lives. But, how do entrants choose which relationships to pursue among the numerous possibilities a new environment offers? We expect newcomers will use the same mechanisms as longer-tenured members, although this will take time as they acclimate and form initial relationships that support future ties. Thus, our goal is to understand how the network selection processes used by new organizational members shift in importance as time in the organization grows. We focus on network selection via homophily, propinquity, formal relations, and endogenous network processes. For each mechanism, we distinguish between change in the strength of the mechanism and opportunities to enact the mechanism. We evaluate expected changes using network data from a prison-based therapeutic community (TC). This setting is ideal because the structured nature of TC entry and exit generates regular membership turnover and removes confounds present in studies of more familiar contexts (e.g., schools). Results show that the relative importance of network selection mechanisms varies over tenure, with homophily dominating early on and endogenous network processes catching up later. We discuss implications of these findings for new member socialization and broader patterns of inequality.

<title>Social Network Dynamics and Biographical Disruption: The Case of "First-Timers" with Mental Illness</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/666377</url>
<snippet>This study examines how dynamics surrounding biographical disruptions compare to more routine fluctuations in personal social networks. Using data from the Indianapolis Network Mental Health Study, the authors track changes in patients' social networks over three years and compare them to a representative sample of persons with no self-reported mental illness. Overall, individuals at the onset of treatment report larger and more broadly functional social networks than individuals in the population at large. However, the number of network ties among the latter increases over time, whereas network size decreases slightly among people using mental health services. As individuals progress through treatment, less broadly supportive ties drop out of extended networks, but a core safety net remains relatively intact. The findings in this case provide evidence that social network dynamics reflect changing needs and resources: persons labeled with psychiatric disorders learn to manage illness, with functionality driving social interaction in times of biographical disruption.

<title>Interpreting change as controllable: The role of network centrality and self-efficacy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0018726712441642</url>
<snippet>Interpreting organizational change initiatives as controllable can mean the difference between achieving positive or negative outcomes. However, little is known about the factors that underpin such interpretations. This study examines how interpretations of controllability are influenced by individual centrality in social networks and change-related self-efficacy. Drawing on a sample of 148 US public school teachers facing a significant organizational transformation, our analysis reveals that change-related self-efficacy fully mediates relationships between centrality within instrumental and expressive organizational social networks and individual interpretations of change controllability. Network centrality, and the associated access to information and social support that accompany it, are theorized to provide the confidence necessary to interpret change as within one's control. Drawing upon social network theory, we provide insights into how change is interpreted as controllable, and how the nature of change may dictate which types of centrality are most important for such interpretations. Implications for the broader understanding of change are also discussed.

<title>PEER GROUP-STRUCTURE AND ADOLESCENT CIGARETTE-SMOKING - A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2137204</url>
<snippet>Social network theory and analysis are applied to examine whether adolescents who fill various social positions that characterize peer group structure differ in prevalence of current smoking. One thousand and ninety-two (1,092) ninth graders in one school system named their three best friends, allowing the identification of each adolescent as clique member, clique liaison, or isolate. At four of five schools, the odds of being a current smoker were significantly higher for isolates than for clique members and liaisons. The relationship was not explained by demographic variables or by the number of friends who smoke.

<title>Theorizing and mapping media ownership networks in authoritarian-populist contexts: a comparative analysis of Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, and Turkey</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01634437231179366</url>
<snippet>This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discussions on authoritarian populism and the media, from the lens of the political economy of ownership. In contrast to studies that consider the link between media and authoritarian populism by focusing on the discursive structures of populist communication, this study analyses changes in the structure of news media ownership in four European countries that have been subject to authoritarian populism. By employing social network analysis, a methodology rarely used in media ownership research, we reveal how news media ownership concentration as well as changes in ownership structures have provided favorable conditions for the rise and endurance of authoritarian populism. Our study covers ownership developments during the period 2000 to 2020, in Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, and Turkey where authoritarian populist tendencies have been evident, albeit to varying degrees. Conclusions are drawn to illustrate how authoritarian populist actors in the sample countries not only capitalize on prevailing news media ownership structures, but also proactively intervene in ownership relations in order to increase influence over the diffusion of information.

<title>Co-evolution of a socio-cognitive scientific network: A case study of citation dynamics among astronomers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.11.008</url>
<snippet>This paper aims to understand how a group of academics cite each others' work through time, considering the simultaneous co-evolution of three networks representing their scientific collaboration, the journals in which they publish and institutional membership. It argues that both social and cognitive processes contribute to these dynamics. Two types of network mechanisms are considered specifically: closures by affiliation and closures by association. To assess whether these mechanisms generate the macro features of the network under study, we propose new features for three-mode multilevel networks such as the mixed geodesic distances, mixed degree distributions, and the mixed quadrilateral census. We investigate whether a micro-level model that considers the above-mentioned network mechanisms is able to correctly reproduce these features. We apply stochastic actororiented models (SAOMs) for one-mode and two-mode networks to link the micro-macro processes using a dataset of a scientific community of astronomers from 2013 to 2015. The results suggest that social relationships grounded on scientific collaboration and proximity based on institutional affiliation are more accurately suited to understanding the co-evolution of the network of citations than an alternative approach that merely considers cognitive-based networks measured as the similarity in publishing in the same journals.

<title>A multi-component, community-based strategy to facilitate COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Latinx populations: From theory to practice</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257111</url>
<snippet>Background COVID-19 vaccine coverage in the Latinx community depends on delivery systems that overcome barriers such as institutional distrust, misinformation, and access to care. We hypothesized that a community-centered vaccination strategy that included mobilization, vaccination, and "activation" components could successfully reach an underserved Latinx population, utilizing its social networks to boost vaccination coverage. Methods Our community-academic-public health partnership, "Unidos en Salud," utilized a theory-informed approach to design our "Motivate, Vaccinate, and Activate" COVID-19 vaccination strategy. Our strategy's design was guided by the PRECEDE Model and sought to address and overcome predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination faced by Latinx individuals in San Francisco. We evaluated our prototype outdoor, "neighborhood" vaccination program located in a central commercial and transport hub in the Mission District in San Francisco, using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework during a 16-week period from February 1, 2021 to May 19, 2021. Programmatic data, city-wide COVID-19 surveillance data, and a survey conducted between May 2, 2021 and May 19, 2021 among 997 vaccinated clients &gt;= 16 years old were used in the evaluation. Results There were 20,792 COVID-19 vaccinations administered at the neighborhood site during the 16-week evaluation period. Vaccine recipients had a median age of 43 (IQR 32-56) years, 53.9&#37; were male and 70.5&#37; were Latinx, 14.1&#37; white, 7.7&#37; Asian, 2.4&#37; Black, and 5.3&#37; other. Latinx vaccinated clients were substantially more likely than non-Latinx clients to have an annual household income of less than $50,000 a year (76.1&#37; vs. 33.5&#37;), be a first-generation immigrant (60.2&#37; vs. 30.1&#37;), not have health insurance (47.3&#37; vs. 16.0&#37;), and not have access to primary care provider (62.4&#37; vs. 36.2&#37;). The most frequently reported reasons for choosing vaccination at the site were its neighborhood location (28.6&#37;), easy and convenient scheduling (26.9&#37;) and recommendation by someone they trusted (18.1&#37;); approximately 99&#37; reported having an overall positive experience, regardless of ethnicity. Notably, 58.3&#37; of clients reported that they were able to get vaccinated earlier because of the neighborhood vaccination site, 98.4&#37; of clients completed both vaccine doses, and 90.7&#37; said that they were more likely to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to family and friends after their experience; these findings did not substantially differ according to ethnicity. There were 40.3&#37; of vaccinated clients who said they still knew at least one unvaccinated person (64.6&#37; knew &gt;= 3). Among clients who received both vaccine doses (n = 729), 91.0&#37; said that after their vaccination experience, they had personally reached out to at least one unvaccinated person they knew (61.6&#37; reached out to &gt;= 3) to recommend getting vaccinated; 83.0&#37; of clients reported that one or more friends, and/or family members got vaccinated as a result of their outreach, including 18.9&#37; who reported 6 or more persons got vaccinated as a result of their influence. Conclusions A multi-component, "Motivate, Vaccinate, and Activate" community-based strategy addressing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination for the Latinx population reached the intended population, and vaccinated individuals served as ambassadors to recruit other friends and family members to get vaccinated.

<title>The Impact of CEO Characteristics on the International Entrepreneurship of Small Island-Based Firms</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.24043/isj.406</url>
<snippet>This paper examines the impact of CEO characteristics on the International Entrepreneurship (IE) of listed island-based firms (IBFs) during the period 2009-2018. The research considers 164 companies from a sample of eight small islands with securities exchanges including more than one firm headquartered on the island. The selected islands are: Barbados, Cyprus, Fiji, Iceland, Jamaica, Malta, Mauritius, and Trinidad &amp; Tobago. Framed on the upper echelons theory and social network theory, the influence on IE of CEO's tenure, academic background and achievement, family allegiance, and international exposure is studied, taking into account the small island particularities. Through a binary probit model, it is concluded that CEOs' family allegiance, tenure, and academic background (if the CEO majored in Business Administration, Finance, Accounting, or Economics) are negatively related with IE, while CEOs' academic achievement and international exposure are positively associated with IE. Some of these results are atypical in the existing literature; nevertheless, islandness can explain these results. The conclusions attained suggest new theoretical and empirical lines of IE research for IBFs.

<title>A bibliometric analysis of the use of the Gamification Octalysis Framework in training: evidence from Web of Science</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02243-3</url>
<snippet>The Octalysis framework, which systematically organizes gamified elements in non-game settings, such as training, has become one of the most famous persuasive tools for changing user behaviour. The field of Gamification Octalysis Framework research is expanding rapidly, moving beyond elementary questions like "what" and "why" to more complex ones like "how" and "when". However, there remain empirical and theoretical challenges such as demonstrating the effectiveness of the Gamification Octalysis Framework and codifying the principles underpinning effective gamification design. This paper uses bibliometric analysis and scientific mapping to characterize the structure and development of the academic field of the Gamification Octalysis Framework, with the help of intellectual, conceptual, and social network structures of the framework. Our findings provide insight into the field's research frontiers and intellectual structures, the interconnections between articles, authors, and keywords, the current collaborative networks, the hottest themes, and the most cited authors, publications, and sources, for instance, that in recent years, the Gamification Octalysis Framework has attracted significant research attention in the training field. Interestingly, 66.6&#37; of cutting-edge research is done in the social sciences, as compared to science and technology. Researchers, academicians and professionals should be made aware of Octalysis framework gamified method because it has been shown to increase user engagement and motivation outside of social sciences game setting. We recommend that countries outside Europe integrate the Gamification Octalysis Framework in training into their learning programs and launch corresponding research centres and journals.

<title>A prospective examination of online social network dynamics and smoking cessation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183655</url>
<snippet>Introduction Use of online social networks for smoking cessation has been associated with abstinence. Little is known about the mechanisms through which the formation of social ties in an online network may influence smoking behavior. Using dynamic social network analysis, we investigated how temporal changes of an individual's number of social network ties are prospectively related to abstinence in an online social network for cessation. In a network where quitting is normative and is the focus of communications among members, we predicted that an increasing number of ties would be positively associated with abstinence. Method Participants were N = 2,657 adult smokers recruited to a randomized cessation treatment trial following enrollment on BecomeAnEX. org, a longstanding Internet cessation program with a large and mature online social network. At 3-months post-randomization, 30-day point prevalence abstinence was assessed and website engagement metrics were extracted. The social network was constructed with clickstream data to capture the flow of information among members. Two network centrality metrics were calculated at weekly intervals over 3 months: 1) indegree, defined as the number of members whose posts a participant read; and 2) out-degreeaware, defined as the number of members who read a participant's post and commented, which was subsequently viewed by the participant. Three groups of users were identified based on social network engagement patterns: non-users (N = 1,362), passive users (N = 812), and active users (N = 483). Logistic regression modeled 3-month abstinence by group as a function of baseline variables, website utilization, and network centrality metrics. Results Abstinence rates varied by group (non-users = 7.7&#37;, passive users = 10.7&#37;, active users = 20.7&#37;). Significant baseline predictors of abstinence were age, nicotine dependence, confidence to quit, and smoking temptations in social situations among passive users (ps &lt; .05); age and confidence to quit among active users. Among centrality metrics, positive associations with abstinence were observed for in-degree increases from Week 2 to Week 12 among passive and active users, and for out-degree-aware increases from Week 2 to Week 12 among active users (ps &lt; .05). Conclusions This study is the first to demonstrate that increased tie formation among members of an online social network for smoking cessation is prospectively associated with abstinence. It also highlights the value of using individuals' activities in online social networks to predict their offline health behaviors.

<title>Deepening the Consequences of Multidisciplinarity on Research: The Moderating Role of Social Capital</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11024-020-09404-7</url>
<snippet>This paper discusses the relationship between multidisciplinarity and research performance in the academic context. The paper explains how scholars' scientific performance is affected by the multidisciplinarity of the network of colleagues with whom they conduct their research. Furthermore, this paper explores the potential moderating role of academics' social capital, assuming that relational dynamics can mitigate the potential problems associated with disciplinary diversity. To build the proposed model, the paper draws on previous literature on diversity and social capital. The resulting hypotheses are tested through a quantitative study developed on the basis of a sample of scholars in the field of management. Information about multidisciplinarity and research performance was extracted from the Scopus database, while social capital variables were measured through social network analysis techniques. Econometric estimations were used to test the proposed relationships. The findings suggest that the effect of multidisciplinarity and researchers' performance can be depicted as an inverted U-shaped relationship, so an optimal intermediate level of diversity can be found. Estimations also show that relational, cognitive and structural social capital moderates this curvilinear relationship, making it possible to achieve higher research performance at higher levels of multidisciplinarity.

<title>"It's like these CHCs don't exist, are they featured anywhere?": Social network analysis of community health committees in a rural and urban setting in Kenya</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220836</url>
<snippet>Background In Kenya, Community Health Committees (CHC) were established to enhance community participation in health services. Their role is to provide leadership, oversight in delivery of community health services, promote social accountability and mobilize resources for community health. CHCs form social networks with other actors, with whom they exchange health information for decision-making and accountability. This case study aimed to explore the structure of a rural and an urban CHC network and to analyze how health-related information flowed in these networks. Understanding the pathways of information in community settings may provide recommendations for strategies to improve the role and functioning of CHCs. Methods In 2017, we conducted 4 focus group discussions with 27 community discussants and 10 semi-structured interviews with health professionals in a rural area and an urban slum. Using social network analysis, we determined the structure of their social networks and how health related information flowed in these networks. Results Both CHCs were composed of respected persons nominated by their communities. Each social network had 12 actors that represented both community and government institutions. CHCs were not central actors in the exchange of health-related information. Health workers, community health volunteers and local Chiefs in the urban slum often passed information between the different groups of actors, while CHCs hardly did this. Therefore, CHCs had little control over the flow of health-related information. Although CHC members were respected persons who served in multiple roles within their communities, this did not enhance their centrality. It emerged that CHCs were often left out in the flow of health-related information and decision-making, which led to demotivation. Community health volunteers were more involved by other actors such as health managers and non-governmental organizations as a conduit for health-related information. Conclusion Social network analysis demonstrated how CHCs played a peripheral role in the flow of health-related information. Their perception of being left out of the information flow led to demotivation, which hampered their ability to facilitate community participation in community health services; hence challenging effective participation through CHCs.

<title>"Choose Your Classmates, Your GPA Is at Stake!": The Association of Cross-Class Social Ties and Academic Performance</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764213479362</url>
<snippet>This article presents results from an investigation of the association between student academic performance and social ties. Based on social capital and networked learning research, we hypothesized that (a) students' social capital accumulated through their course progression is positively associated with their academic performance and (b) students with more social capital have significantly higher academic performance (operationalized as grade point average). Both hypotheses were supported by results of an empirical study that analyzed 10 years of student course enrolment records (N = 505) in a master's degree program offered through distance education at a Canadian university. These results are consistent with previous studies that looked at social networks built through student interaction in classrooms or computer-mediated communication environments. The significance of this research lies in the simplicity of the method used to establish student social networks from existing course registration records readily available through an institution's student information system. Direct implications of this research are that (a) study plans for students should consider investment in building new social ties in each course during degree programs and (b) readily available data about cross-class networks can be used in software systems supporting study planning.

<title>The Relationship Between Emotional Dependence on Facebook and Psychological Well-Being in Adolescents Aged 13-16</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12187-016-9438-3</url>
<snippet>In most countries, Facebook is one of the top social networking sites among children and adolescents. Several studies have investigated the effect of Facebook dependency on individuals' psychological well-being. However, inadequate studies have examined the impacts of Facebook in eudaimonic well-being. The current study explores how emotional dependence on Facebook relates to psychological well-being in eudaimonic approach. A total of 401, 13 to 16 yearsold who studied at an upper secondary school in Malaysia participated in this study. We expected a negative association between emotional dependence on Facebook and psychological wellbeing. The moderation effect of self-efficacy was examined in the current research. The results of structural equation modeling revealed that emotional dependence on Facebook negatively effects adolescents' overall psychological well-being. The influence was more pronounced on autonomy, purpose in life, and positive relationship with others. The results also demonstrated that high self-efficacy did not reduce negative impacts of Facebook emotional dependence on adolescents' psychological well-being.

<title>Cognitive and Social Structure of the Elite Collaboration Network of Astrophysics: A Case Study on Shifting Network Structures</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11024-011-9184-0</url>
<snippet>Scientific collaboration can only be understood along the epistemic and cognitive grounding of scientific disciplines. New scientific discoveries in astrophysics led to a major restructuring of the elite network of astrophysics. To study the interplay of the epistemic grounding and the social network structure of a discipline, a mixed-methods approach is necessary. It combines scientometrics, quantitative network analysis and visualization tools with a qualitative network analysis approach. The centre of the international collaboration network of astrophysics is demarcated by identifying the 225 most productive astrophysicists. For the years 1998-1999 and 2001-2006 four co-authorship networks are constructed comprehending each a two year period. A visualization of the longitudinal network data gives first hints on the structural development of the network. The network of 2005-2006 is analyzed in depth. Based on cohesion analysis tools for network analysis, two main cores and three smaller ones are identified. Scientists in each core and additionally in structurally interesting positions are identified and 17 qualitative expert interviews are conducted with them. The visualization of the network of 2005-2006 is used in the interviews as a stimulus for the interviewees. An analysis of the three most often used keywords of the 225 astrophysicists is included and combined with the other data. The triangulation of these approaches shows that major epistemic changes in astrophysics, e.g. the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe, together with technical and organizational innovations, leads to a restructuring of the network of the discipline. The importance of a combination of qualitative and quantitative network analysis tools for the understanding of the interplay of cognitive and social structure in the sociology of science is substantiated.

<title>The network structure of social capital</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0191-3085(00)22009-1</url>
<snippet>This is a review of argument and evidence on the connection between social networks and social capital. My summary points are three: (1) Research and theory will better cumulate across studies if we focus an the network mechanisms responsible for social capital effects rather than trying to integrate across metaphors of social capital loosely tied to distant empirical indicators. (2) There is an impressive diversity of empirical evidence showing that social capital is more a function of brokerage across structural holes than closure within a network, bur there are contingency factors. (3) The two leading network mechanisms can be brought together in a productive way within a more general model of social capital. Structural holes are the source of value added, but network closure can be essential to realizing the value buried in the holes.

<title>Gender Segregation in Civic Life: Women's and Men's Involvement in Voluntary Associations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08912432231195075</url>
<snippet>The pervasive persistence of gender segregation has been documented in a myriad of social settings, implying that women and men primarily encounter peers of their own gender in daily life. While voluntary associations are often praised for their ability to bridge other social divides, previous research indicates substantive gender disparities in voluntary involvement. Yet we still know relatively little about the extent and origins of gender segregation in civic life. In this article, we study gender homophily in voluntary involvement and examine how structural features of friendship networks and traditional gender norms bring about gender segregation. Employing data from a German panel study (SC6-NEPS), we analyze cross-sectional patterns of gender segregation and run multinomial and binary logistic regressions to model joining and quitting transitions. Our results indicate substantive gender segregation across and within types of voluntary associations. The overall gender segregation is driven by homophilous transitions into associational contexts, not by selective quitting decisions. Gender-segregated friendship networks partially explain the tendency to join organizations dominated by one's own gender. Traditional gender norms are associated with more homophilous joining transitions among men, but not among women. Overall, these findings imply that civic life perpetuates the structural significance of gender.

<title>Social network composition of vascular patients and its associations with health behavior and clinical risk factors</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185341</url>
<snippet>Background This study aimed to explore linkages of patients' social network composition with health behaviors and clinical risk factors. Methods/Design This observational study was embedded in a project aimed at improving cardiovascular risk management (CRVM) in primary care. 657 vascular patients (227 with cardiovascular disease, 380 at high vascular risk), mean age 72.4 (SD 9.4) years, were recruited as were individuals patients considered important for dealing with their disease, so called alters (n = 487). Network composition was measured with structured patient questionnaires. Both patients and alters completed questionnaires to measure health behavior (habits for physical activity, diet, and smoking). Clinical risk factors (systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol level, and body mass index) were extracted from patients' medical records. Six logistic regression analyses, using generalized estimating equations, were used to test three hypothesized effects of network composition (having alters with healthful behaviors, without depression, and with specialized knowledge) on six outcomes, adjusted for demographic, personal and psychological characteristics. Results Having alters with overall healthful behavior was related to healthful patient diet (OR 2.14, 95&#37; CI: 1.52-3.02). Having non-smoking alters in networks was related to reduced odds for patient smoking (OR 0.17, 95&#37; CI: 0.05-0.60). No effects of presence of non-depressed alters were found. Presence of alters with specialized knowledge on CVRM was inversely related to healthful diet habits of patients (OR 0.47, 95&#37; CI 0.24-0.89). No significant associations between social network composition and clinical risk factors were found. Discussion Diet and smoking, but not physical exercise and clinical risk factors, were associated with social network composition of patients with vascular conditions. In this study of vascular patients, controlling for both personal and psychological factors, fewer network influences were found compared to previous research. Further research is needed to examine network structure characteristics as well as the role of psychological factors to enhance understanding health behavior of patients involved in CVRM.

<title>The Role of Skin Color in Latino Social Networks: Color Homophily in Sending and Receiving Societies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2332649220940346</url>
<snippet>How does skin color shape the social networks and integration pathways of phenotypically diverse immigrant groups? Focusing on Dominicans and Puerto Ricans. groups with considerable diversity across the Black-White color line, the authors explore whether migrants to the United States have greater color homophily in their primary social networks than nonmigrants in the sending societies. The authors analyze egocentric network data, including unique skin color measures for both 114 respondents and 1,702 alters. They test hypotheses derived from ethnic unifier theory and color line racialization theory. The data show evidence of color homophily among Dominicans but suggest that these patterns may be imported from the sending society rather than fostered by the U.S. context. Furthermore, the authors find that migrants' skin color is associated with having ties to White or Black Americans but with different patterns for each ethnic group. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for economic mobility and U.S. racial hierarchies.

<title>The gender gap in job authority: Do social network resources matter?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0001699319847504</url>
<snippet>Women generally have less job authority than men. Previous research has shown that human capital, family features and contextual factors cannot fully explain this gender authority gap. Another popular explanation holds that women's career opportunities are limited because their social networks comprise less beneficial contacts and resources than men's. Yet, the role of social networks has received little attention in empirical research seeking to explain the gender gap in job authority. This study examines to what extent gender differences in social networks exist and are related to the gender authority gap. Drawing on two strands of social network theory, we develop hypotheses about the role of network diversity and network status. We test these hypotheses using representative longitudinal data from the NEtherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study (2009-2013). Results reveal that women generally had less diverse occupational networks in terms of contacts' occupations and were less likely to know managers than men, network features which are found to be significantly related to job authority. Controlling for these gender differences in networks leads to a reduction of the observed gender authority gap that is statistically significant but modest in substantive terms.

<title>Online social integration is associated with reduced mortality risk</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1605554113</url>
<snippet>Social interactions increasingly take place online. Friendships and other offline social ties have been repeatedly associated with human longevity, but online interactions might have different properties. Here, we reference 12 million social media profiles against California Department of Public Health vital records and use longitudinal statistical models to assess whether social media use is associated with longer life. The results show that receiving requests to connect as friends online is associated with reduced mortality but initiating friendships is not. Additionally, online behaviors that indicate face-to-face social activity (like posting photos) are associated with reduced mortality, but online-only behaviors (like sending messages) have a nonlinear relationship, where moderate use is associated with the lowest mortality. These results suggest that online social integration is linked to lower risk for a wide variety of critical health problems. Although this is an associational study, it may be an important step in understanding how, on a global scale, online social networks might be adapted to improve modern populations' social and physical health.

<title>Is fertility contagious? Using panel data to disentangle mechanisms of social network influences on fertility decisions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2013.10.001</url>
<snippet>Using panel data (N = 1.679 married and cohabiting couples), this paper investigates the presence and causal mechanisms of social contagion processes regarding first births. Results confirmed the hypothesized positive association between the number of network members (friends, acquaintances, siblings) with young children and the respondents' transition rate into parenthood, particularly among younger couples. Several potential intervening mechanisms underlying this social contagion effect were tested. First, evidence was found for observational learning processes in which Ego obtained information on the joys and challenges of parenthood from network members with children. Second, childless respondents tended to feel pressured from couples with children in the network to start a family. Third, results supported the notion of social opportunity costs in that the anticipated loss of social ties after becoming a parent was more likely the fewer parents there were in the network. All three mechanisms exerted a positive impact on both fertility intentions and behavior. Panel regression models relying on intraindividtal change scores showed that social learning was the most robust mechanism. An additional indirect test for causality suggested that the findings were unlikely to merely reflect parental status homophily (i.e., selection effects). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

<title>Analyzing the factors that influence the seeking and sharing of information on the smart city digital platform: Empirical evidence from Indonesia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.101876</url>
<snippet>Smart city initiatives are considered as the solutions for urban problems. One dimension of a smart city, i.e., smart people/society, suggests that a smart city requires high-quality social interactions and social relationships that help cities connect with their residents and the outside world. For this purpose, smart cities in Indonesia have developed digital platforms (internet websites and mobile applications) to disseminate the cities' programs and information and facilitate sharing of information among its residents. This study aimed to investigate the factors that affect the seeking and sharing of information on the smart city digital platforms. We used a quantitative approach by conducting surveys in 8 smart cities in Indonesia, with 1161 respondents. The survey data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that social factors (sense of belonging and seeking reputations) have dominant roles in determining residents' intention to seek information on smart city platforms. In turn, the intention to seek information is the key factor that affects the residents' intention to share information on the smart city platforms and on their online social network. This paper provides insights on the factors that need more attention from smart city administrators to improve resident engagement and enhance the dimension of smart people.

<title>Contributions of brokerage roles to firms' innovation in a confectionery cluster</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2015.1045858</url>
<snippet>Scholars have provided valuable insights into the networking phenomenon and its impact on firms' performance. Nonetheless, a wide spectrum of issues remains unexplored. Using the network approach, this paper examines the different patterns of intermediation between otherwise disconnected firms and its impact on innovation performance. Our research was conducted on a well-known confectionery cluster in the Valencia region. The data allowed us to calculate four brokerage roles, depending on the affiliation of the organisations involved. Through these values, we open the 'black box' of brokerage by examining the differential contributions made to innovation performance by the coordinator, gatekeeper, representative, and liaison roles. These differences between roles are based on the tacit or explicit nature of the knowledge transferred and the specificities of each broker profile. Consequently, the research makes a relevant contribution to the network and cluster literatures and implies some useful recommendations for policy-makers and individual firms.

<title>The differential contributions of teen drinking homophily to new and existing friendships: An empirical assessment of assortative and proximity selection mechanisms</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.05.001</url>
<snippet>Alcohol use, is pervasive in adolescence. Though most research is concerned with how friends influence drinking, alcohol is also important for connecting teens to one another. Prior studies have not distinguished between new friendship creation, and existing friendship durability, however. We argue that accounting for distinctions in creation-durability processes is critical for understanding the selection mechanisms drawing drinkers into homophilous friendships, and the social integration that results. In order to address these issues, we applied stochastic actor based models of network dynamics to National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data. Adolescents only modestly prefer new friendships with others who drinker similarly, but greatly prefer friends who indirectly connect them to homophilous drinkers. These indirect homophilous drinker relationships are shorter lived, however, and suggest that drinking is a social focus that connects adolescents via proximity, rather than assortativity. These findings suggest that drinking leads to more situational and superficial social integration.

<title>Short-term and long-term effects of a social network intervention on friendships among university students</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59594-z</url>
<snippet>Informal social relations, such as friendships, are crucial for the well-being and success of students at all levels of education. Network interventions can aim at providing contact opportunities in school settings to prevent the social isolation of individuals and facilitate integration between otherwise segregated social groups. We investigate the short-term and long-term effects of one specific network intervention in an undergraduate cohort freshly admitted to an engineering department (N=226). In this intervention, we randomly assigned students into small groups at an introduction event two months prior to their first day at university. The groups were designed to increase mixed-gender contact opportunities. Two months after the intervention, we find a higher rate of friendships, common friends, and mixed-gender friendships in pairs of students who were assigned to the same group than in pairs from different groups (short-term effects). These effects gradually diminish over the first academic year (long-term effects). Using stochastic actor-oriented models, we investigate the long-term trajectory of the intervention effects, while considering alternative network processes, such as reciprocity, transitivity, homophily, and popularity. The results suggest that even though the induced friendship ties are less stable than other friendships, they may serve as early seeds for complex social network processes. Our study shows that simple network interventions can have a pronounced short-term effect and indirect long-term effects on the evolution and structure of student communities.

<title>Power and Relation in the World Polity: The INGO Network Country Score, 1978-1998</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/sof.0.0217</url>
<snippet>World polity theory is explicitly relational, implying a global network structure that exists outside of the nation-state. And world polity theory increasingly acknowledges power - that some states and regions are dominant in the international field. But current world polity measures of international nongovernmental organizations do not adequately incorporate either networks or power, leading to a mismatch between theory and measurement. In this article, we draw upon world polity, world system and social networks theories to inform the development Of a new over-time measure Of country-level connectedness to the world polity, which we label the "INGO Network Country Score." This measure scores countries by their centrality in the world country-INGO network. We compare our newly-proposed INGO Network Country Score to the traditional measure (country-level raw counts of INGO memberships) and demonstrate striking differences. Our network-based measure shows less inequality among Western countries than the traditional measure, and greater inequality between the West and the rest of the world. Looking over time, we draw three further implications from our new measure. First, there is evidence of inequality in network centrality in the world polity at all time points. Second, regional inequalities persist. Third, connections in the world polity are not exponentially increasing, as previously hypothesized. An added benefit of the analysis is our presentation of the first visual representation of country connections through INGOs.

<title>Homophily in coauthorship networks of East European sociologists</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep36152</url>
<snippet>We study to what degree and how homophily and network properties affect individual citation counts of researchers in the sociology departments of three East European countries, namely Poland, Romania, and Slovenia. We built first-order personal coauthorship networks out of the Web of Science publication records. Each sociologist is assigned as a focal node or ego, while her coauthors are alters. We analyze the data using structural measurements methods, hierarchical regression models, and we make visualizations based on the clustered graph technique. For all three populations, our results indicate that the mean score of the citations of alters substantially predicts the citation counts of egos. In particular, citation similarity increases the chances for coauthorship ties. Evidence for the impact of network properties on the citation levels of egos is mixed. For Poland, normalized ego-betweenness shows a negative effect on citation counts, while network density displays a positive one. For Romania and Slovenia, network characteristics have only a minor impact. Even if the visual summarization of the personal networks uncovers a wide palette of coauthorship patterns, homophily appears to be pervasive. These results are relevant for domestic policy makers who aim to improve the aggregated research performance in East European countries.

<title>Evaluation of strategies to mitigate contagion spread using social network characteristics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2013.01.002</url>
<snippet>Computer simulation is an effective tool for assessing mitigation strategies, with recent trends concentrating on agent-based techniques. These methods require high computational efforts in order to simulate enough scenarios for statistical significance. The population individuals and their contacts determined by agent-based simulations form a social network. For some network structures it is possible to gain high accuracy estimates of contagion spread based on the connection structure of the network, an idea that is utilized in this work. A representative social network constructed from the 2006 census of the Greater Toronto Area (Ontario, Canada) of 5 million individuals in 1.8 million households is used to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We examine the effects of six mitigation strategies with respect to their ability to contain disease spread as indicated by pre- and post-vaccination reproduction numbers, mean local clustering coefficients and degree distributions. One outcome of the analysis provides evidence supporting the design of mitigation strategies that aim to fragment the population into similarly sized components. While our analysis is framed in the context of pandemic disease spread, the approach is applicable to any contagion such as computer viruses, rumours, social trends, and so on.

<title>Social networks and risk of delayed hospital arrival after acute stroke</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09073-5</url>
<snippet>Arriving rapidly to the hospital after a heart attack or stroke is critical for patients to be within time windows for treatment. Prior research in heart attacks has suggested a paradoxical role of the social environment: those who arrive early are surrounded by nonrelatives, while those who arrive late are surrounded by spouses or family members. Here, we used network methods to more deeply examine the influence of social context in stroke. We examined the relationship of personal social networks and arrival time in 175 stroke patients. Our results confirmed the paradox by showing that small and close-knit personal networks of highly familiar contacts, independent of demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic factors, were related to delay. The closed network structure led to constricted information flow in which patients and close confidants, absent outside perspectives, elected to watch-and-wait. Targeting patients with small, close-knit networks may be one strategy to improve response times.

<title>Robustness and rich clubs in collaborative learning groups: a learning analytics study using network science</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71483-z</url>
<snippet>Productive and effective collaborative learning is rarely a spontaneous phenomenon but rather the result of meeting a set of conditions, orchestrating and scaffolding productive interactions. Several studies have demonstrated that conflicts can have detrimental effects on student collaboration. Through the application of network science, and social network analysis in particular, this learning analytics study investigates the concept of group robustness; that is, the capacity of collaborative groups to remain functional despite the withdrawal or absence of group members, and its relation to group performance in the frame of collaborative learning. Data on all student and teacher interactions were collected from two phases of a course in medical education that employed an online learning environment. Visual and mathematical analysis were conducted, simulating the removal of actors and its effect on the group's robustness and network structure. In addition, the extracted network parameters were used as features in machine learning algorithms to predict student performance. The study contributes findings that demonstrate the use of network science to shed light on essential elements of collaborative learning and demonstrates how the concept and measures of group robustness can increase understanding of the conditions of productive collaborative learning. It also contributes to understanding how certain interaction patterns can help to promote the sustainability or robustness of groups, while other interaction patterns can make the group more vulnerable to withdrawal and dysfunction. The finding also indicate that teachers can be a driving factor behind the formation of rich clubs of well-connected few and less connected many in some cases and can contribute to a more collaborative and sustainable process where every student is included.Y

<title>Indirect influence in social networks as an induced percolation phenomenon</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2100151119</url>
<snippet>Percolation theory has been widely used to study phase transitions in network systems. It has also successfully explained various macroscopic spreading phenomena across different fields. Yet, the theoretical frameworks have been focusing on direct interactions among nodes, while recent empirical observations have shown that indirect interactions are common in many network systems like social and ecological networks, among others. By investigating the detailed mechanism of both direct and indirect influence on scientific collaboration networks, here we show that indirect influence can play the dominant role in behavioral influence. To address the lack of theoretical understanding of such indirect influence on the macroscopic behavior of the system, we propose a percolation mechanism of indirect interactions called induced percolation. Surprisingly, our model exhibits a unique anisotropy property. Specifically, directed networks show first-order abrupt transitions as opposed to the second-order continuous transition in the same network structure but with undirected links. A mix of directed and undirected links leads to rich hybrid phase transitions. Furthermore, a unique feature of the nonmonotonic pattern is observed in network connectivities near the critical point. We also present an analytical framework to characterize the proposed induced percolation, paving the way to further understanding network dynamics with indirect interactions.

<title>A Community Perspective on Resilience Analytics: A Visual Analysis of Community Mood</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/risa.12788</url>
<snippet>Social networks are ubiquitous in everyday life. Although commonly analyzed from a perspective of individual interactions, social networks can provide insights about the collective behavior of a community. It has been shown that changes in the mood of social networks can be correlated to economic trends, public demonstrations, and political reactions, among others. In this work, we study community resilience in terms of the mood variations of the community. We have developed a method to characterize the mood steady-state of online social networks and to analyze how this steady-state is affected under certain perturbations or events that affect a community. We applied this method to study community behavior for three real social network situations, with promising results.

<title>Psychological Well-Being and Brokerage in Friendship Networks of Young Swedes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-014-0766-8</url>
<snippet>All ethnic groups have norms and values according to which one is expected to behave. Immigrants in particular have personal networks that simultaneously consist of co-ethnics and friends of a different ethnic background. As a consequence, they may be accustomed to the behavior, norms, and values of their own ethnic group, and also be expected to behave according to those of another ethnic group. This may either lead to ego-gratification and the strengthening and enrichment of their personality, or to feelings of stress and non-acceptance if they cannot behave fully in accordance with the expectations of their friends. This study addresses the association between interethnic open triads in networks (i.e., brokerage) and individual psychological well-being. That is, we examine whether having intra-ethnic and interethnic relationships with friends who are not also friends with each other, is either positively or negatively associated with psychological well-being. Using (network) data from a large sample (N = 2,942; age = 19) of native Swedes and first- and second-generation immigrants from former Yugoslavia and Iran (all born in 1990 and currently living in Sweden), we show that interethnic brokerage is negatively associated with psychological well-being, which implies that the different norms, values and corresponding behaviors that prevail in different ethnic groups to which the ethnic broker is connected may result in internal and external conflicts, to feelings that one is not fully accepted by any of these groups, and ultimately to a lower level of psychological well-being.

<title>Social Capital and Post-Graduation Destination: International Students in Ireland</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Drawing from social network theory, this study investigates the extent to which bonding and bridging social capital influence the likelihood of staying abroad or returning home after graduation among international students in Ireland. Bonding refers to co-national networks and is measured as the strength of ties and the abundance of resources with co-nationals or family members. Bridging implies crosscutting ties beyond ones co-national network and is measured as contacts with the locals or non-co-nationals. A survey was carried out among Irish university international alumni who graduated between 2014 and 2016. Our main findings suggest: (1) bridging social capital, particularly high-quality and with close bridging ties, are positively associated with the likelihood of staying abroad; (2) human capital, especially field of study and language ability, is positively associated with the likelihood of staying abroad. Policy implications are discussed.

<title>Causal language and strength of inference in academic and media articles shared in social media (CLAIMS): A systematic review</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196346</url>
<snippet>Background The pathway from evidence generation to consumption contains many steps which can lead to overstatement or misinformation. The proliferation of internet-based health news may encourage selection of media and academic research articles that overstate strength of causal inference. We investigated the state of causal inference in health research as it appears at the end of the pathway, at the point of social media consumption. Methods We screened the NewsWhip Insights database for the most shared media articles on Facebook and Twitter reporting about peer-reviewed academic studies associating an exposure with a health outcome in 2015, extracting the 50 most-shared academic articles and media articles covering them. We designed and utilized a review tool to systematically assess and summarize studies' strength of causal inference, including generalizability, potential confounders, and methods used. These were then compared with the strength of causal language used to describe results in both academic and media articles. Two randomly assigned independent reviewers and one arbitrating reviewer from a pool of 21 reviewers assessed each article. Results We accepted the most shared 64 media articles pertaining to 50 academic articles for review, representing 68&#37; of Facebook and 45&#37; of Twitter shares in 2015. Thirty-four percent of academic studies and 48&#37; of media articles used language that reviewers considered too strong for their strength of causal inference. Seventy percent of academic studies were considered low or very low strength of inference, with only 6&#37; considered high or very high strength of causal inference. The most severe issues with academic studies' causal inference were reported to be omitted confounding variables and generalizability. Fifty-eight percent of media articles were found to have inaccurately reported the question, results, intervention, or population of the academic study. Conclusions We find a large disparity between the strength of language as presented to the research consumer and the underlying strength of causal inference among the studies most widely shared on social media. However, because this sample was designed to be representative of the articles selected and shared on social media, it is unlikely to be representative of all academic and media work. More research is needed to determine how academic institutions, media organizations, and social network sharing patterns impact causal inference and language as received by the research consumer.

<title>Better, Faster, Stronger: The Evolution of Co-authorship in International Management Research Between 1990 and 2016</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440211061561</url>
<snippet>As a border-transcending discipline, the advancement of international management research depends on collaboration between scholars, universities, and nations to account for the diversity and complexity of management phenomena. Yet, relatively little is known about how international management has evolved as a field of research. We address this gap by examining the evolution of collaboration patterns on three levels of analysis, applying the concepts of cumulative advantage, preferential attachment, and isomorphic behavior in a diachronic network analysis. Based on 6,874 articles published between 1990 and 2016 in eight international management journals, our analysis shows that collaboration is driven by a few key players on each level. Although the US and UK still represent hubs, semi-peripheral actors from Europe and Asia enter the landscape. Nevertheless, non-western actors are still underrepresented. We tie this effect to the expertise-based hegemonic status of American and British business schools and dynamics of cumulative advantage on country-level.

<title>Friendship network formation in Chinese middle schools: Patterns of inequality and homophily</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.07.003</url>
<snippet>Previous studies on adolescent friendship network formation emphasize the roles played by individual characteristics, structural opportunities, and endogenous tie formation processes. This study extends previous studies in three major aspects: 1) developing and testing theories of status differential (i.e., friendship ties are more likely to run from low status subjects to high status subjects than vice versa) and differential homophily (i.e., homophily is stronger between high status subjects than between low status subjects) through modeling tie-mixing effects of individual characteristics, 2) including qualitative analyses to elaborate selected mechanisms, and 3) comparing selected friendship patterns between China and the U.S. The extended framework is applied to analyzing survey data obtained from 4,094 students in six middle schools in China. The results show that friendship ties are unevenly distributed by individual characteristics (status differential is confirmed for five of the seven characteristics examined), there is significant tie homophily (stronger homophily among high status subjects than among low status subjects is observed for five of the seven characteristics examined with three of them being statistically significant), and endogenous tie formation processes such as reciprocity, transitivity, and preferential attachment are strongly present. Although some of these patterns are common to both China and the U.S., there are also notable differences between the two. Lastly, I discuss the implications and limitations of this study.

<title>How gender differences in informal networking result in unequal access to interorganizational R&amp;D projects</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13511610.2024.2380368</url>
<snippet>Women are underrepresented in interorganizational research &amp; development (R&amp;D) projects. This affects the innovativeness of such projects, the representation of female perspectives in the design of innovations and the career opportunities of women. Such projects often emerge from preceding interorganizational R&amp;D projects and are particularly successful when they do so. We argue that instrumental networking in ongoing projects is constitutive for the formation of such follow-up collaborations and, further, that stereotypical gender roles hinder women's participation in instrumental interactions with their current project partners. Hence, we assume that unequal opportunities to participate in follow-up projects can be attributed to women's lesser involvement in instrumental networks. Empirically, we test our argument using data on 2746 directed and weighted personal relationships across 24 interorganizational R&amp;D projects. We show that instrumental interactions are crucial for who initiates follow-up projects with which current partner. Furthermore, we can show that the low participation of women in these activities can be better explained by gender roles than by gender homophily. In doing so, we reveal an important cause of women's under-representation in R&amp;D.

<title>The association between patient sharing network structure and healthcare costs</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234990</url>
<snippet>Study question While physician relationships (measured through shared patients) are associated with clinical and utilization outcomes, the extent to which this is driven by local or global network characteristics is not well established. The objective of this research is to examine the association between local and global network statistics with total medical spending and utilization. Data source Data used are the 2011 Massachusetts All Payer Claims Database. Study design The association between network statistics and total medical spending and utilization (using standardized prices) is estimated using multivariate regression analysis controlling for patient demographics and health status. Data collection We limit the sample to continuously enrolled commercially insured patients in Massachusetts in 2011. Principal findings Mean patient age was 45 years, and 56.3&#37; of patients were female. 73.4&#37; were covered by a health maintenance organization. Average number of visits was 5.43, with average total medical spending of $4,911 and total medical utilization of $4,252. Spending was lower for patients treated by physicians with higher degree (p&lt;0.001), eigenvector centrality (p&lt;0.001), clustering coefficient (p&lt;0.001), and measures reflecting the normalized degree (p&lt;0.001) and eigenvector centrality (p&lt;0.001) of specialists connected to a patient's PCP. Spending was higher for patients treated by physicians with higher normalized degree, which accounts for physician specialty and patient panel size (p&lt;0.001). Results were similar for utilization outcomes, although magnitudes differed indicating patients may see different priced physicians. Conclusions Generally, higher values of network statistics reflecting local connectivity adjusted for physician characteristics are associated with increased costs and utilization, while higher values of network statistics reflecting global connectivity are associated with decreased costs and utilization. As changes in the financing and delivery system advance through policy changes and healthcare consolidation, future research should examine mechanisms through which this structure impacts outcomes and potential policy responses to determine ways to reduce costs while maintaining quality and coordination of care. What this study adds It is unknown whether local and global measures of physician network connectivity associated with spending and utilization for commercially insured patients? In this social network analysis, we found generally higher values of network statistics reflecting local connectivity are associated with increased costs and utilization, while higher values of network statistics reflecting global connectivity are associated with decreased costs and utilization. Understanding how to influence local and global physician network characteristics may be important for reducing costs while maintaining quality.

<title>Why are some more peer than others? Evidence from a longitudinal study of social networks and individual academic performance</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2011.06.010</url>
<snippet>Studies of peer effects in educational settings confront two main problems. The first is the presence of endogenous sorting which confounds the effects of social influence and social selection on individual attainment. The second is how to account for the local network dependencies through which peer effects influence individual behavior. We empirically address these problems using longitudinal data on academic performance, friendship, and advice seeking relations among students in a full-time graduate academic program. We specify stochastic agent-based models that permit estimation of the interdependent contribution of social selection and social influence to individual performance. We report evidence of peer effects. Students tend to assimilate the average performance of their friends and of their advisors. At the same time, students attaining similar levels of academic performance are more likely to develop friendship and advice ties. Together, these results imply that processes of social influence and social selection are sub-components of a more general a co-evolutionary process linking network structure and individual behavior. We discuss possible points of contact between our findings and current research in the economics and sociology of education. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<title>Formation of homophily in academic performance: Students change their friends rather than performance</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183473</url>
<snippet>Homophily, the tendency of individuals to associate with others who share similar traits, has been identified as a major driving force in the formation and evolution of social ties. In many cases, it is not clear if homophily is the result of a socialization process, where individuals change their traits according to the dominance of that trait in their local social networks, or if it results from a selection process, in which individuals reshape their social networks so that their traits match those in the new environment. Here we demonstrate the detailed temporal formation of strong homophily in academic achievements of high school and university students. We analyze a unique dataset that contains information about the detailed time evolution of a friendship network of 6,000 students across 42 months. Combining the evolving social network data with the time series of the academic performance (GPA) of individual students, we show that academic homophily is a result of selection: students prefer to gradually reorganize their social networks according to their performance levels, rather than adapting their performance to the level of their local group. We find no signs for a pull effect, where a social environment of good performers motivates bad students to improve their performance. We are able to understand the underlying dynamics of grades and networks with a simple model. The lack of a social pull effect in classical educational settings could have important implications for the understanding of the observed persistence of segregation, inequality and social immobility in societies.

<title>Mean-field theory of social laser</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12327-w</url>
<snippet>In this work we suggest a novel paradigm of social laser (solaser), which can explain such Internet inspired social phenomena as echo chambers, reinforcement and growth of information cascades, enhancement of social actions under strong mass media operation. The solaser is based on a wellknown in quantum physics laser model of coherent amplification of the optical field. Social networks are at the core of the solaser model; we define them by means of a network model possessing power-law degree distribution. In the solaser the network environment plays the same role as the gain medium has in a physical laser device. We consider social atoms as decision making agents (humans or even chat bots), which possess two (mental) states and occupy the nodes of a network. The solaser establishes communication between the agents as absorption and spontaneous or stimulated emission of socially actual information within echo chambers, which mimic an optical resonator of a convenient (physical) laser. We have demonstrated that social lasing represents the second order nonequilibrium phase transition, which evokes the release of coherent socially stimulated information field represented with the order parameter. The solaser implies the formation of macroscopic social polarization and results in a huge social impact, which is realized by viral information cascades occurring in the presence of population imbalance (social bias). We have shown that decision making agents follow an adiabatically time dependent mass media pump, which acts in the network community reproducing various reliable scenarios for information cascade evolution. We have also shown that in contrast to physical lasers, due to node degree peculiarities, the coupling strength of decision making agents with the network may be enhanced root &lt; k &gt; times. It leads to a large increase of speed, at which a viral message spreads through a social media. In this case, the mass media pump supports additional reinforcement and acceleration of cascade growth. We have revealed that the solaser model in some approximations possesses clear links with familiar !sing and SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) models typically used for evaluating a social impact and information growth, respectively. However, the solaser paradigm can serve as a new platform for modelling temporal social events, which originate from "microscopic" (quantum-like) processes occurring in the society. Our findings open new perspectives for interdisciplinary studies of distributed intelligence agents behavior associated with information exchange and social impact.

<title>Individuals' power and their social network accuracy: A situated cognition perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.01.006</url>
<snippet>Individuals differ in how accurately they perceive their social environment, but research and theory provide conflicting predictions on whether powerful people are more or less accurate than others. Drawing on social network theory and the situated cognition theory of power, we examine the relationship between individuals' formal and informal power and their perceptual accuracy of social network relationships. We propose that individuals' perceptual accuracy is related to: 1) their formal and informal power in the organization; 2) the type of relationship being perceived (positive/negative valence) and its relevance to task and goal completion; and 3) the dependence relationship with the target of perception (i.e., whether the perceiver is dependent on the perceived to get their work done). Predictions were tested using cognitive social structure data collected from a technical call center. Results showed that power was generally linked to increased perceptual accuracy, particularly for the types of relationships most relevant for task and goal completion. We further demonstrated that social network accuracy was related to employees' outcomes, including subsequent transfer, promotion, and exit from the organization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

<title>Similarity increases altruistic punishment in humans</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1215443110</url>
<snippet>Humans are attracted to similar others. As a consequence, social networks are homogeneous in sociodemographic, intrapersonal, and other characteristics-a principle called homophily. Despite abundant evidence showing the importance of interpersonal similarity and homophily for human relationships, their behavioral correlates and cognitive foundations are poorly understood. Here, we show that perceived similarity substantially increases altruistic punishment, a key mechanism underlying human cooperation. We induced (dis)similarity perception by manipulating basic cognitive mechanisms in an economic cooperation game that included a punishment phase. We found that similarity-focused participants were more willing to punish others' uncooperative behavior. This influence of similarity is not explained by group identity, which has the opposite effect on altruistic punishment. Our findings demonstrate that pure similarity promotes reciprocity in ways known to encourage cooperation. At the same time, the increased willingness to punish norm violations among similarity-focused participants provides a rationale for why similar people are more likely to build stable social relationships. Finally, our findings show that altruistic punishment is differentially involved in encouraging cooperation under pure similarity vs. in-group conditions.

<title>A statistical approach for assessing cyber risk via ordered response models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/risa.14186</url>
<snippet>Proper evaluation of the risk associated to a cyber attack is a crucial aspect for many companies. There is an increasing need to plan for and implement effective ways to address cyber security, data security, and privacy protection. Estimating the risk of a successful cyber attack is an important issue, since this type of threat is proliferating and thus poses increasing danger to companies and the customers who use their services. While quantitative loss data are rarely available, it is possible to obtain a qualitative evaluation on an ordinal scale of severity of cyber attacks from experts of the sector. Hence, it is natural to apply order response models for the analysis of cyber risk. In particular, we rely on cumulative link models. We explain the experts' assessment of the severity of a cyber attack as a function of a set of explanatory variables describing the characteristics of the attack under consideration. A measure of diffusion of the effects of the attacks obtained via the use of a network structure is also incorporated into the set of explanatory variables of the model. Along with the description of the methodology, we present a detailed analysis of a real data set that includes information on serious cyber attacks occurred worldwide in the period 2017-2018.

<title>Online Social Networks and Trust</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-018-1887-2</url>
<snippet>We use Italian data from the Multipurpose Household Survey to explore how participation in social networking sites (SNS) such as Facebook and Twitter affects the most economically relevant aspect of social capital, trust. We account for measures of trust in strangers (often referred to as social trust), trust in neighbours (particularized trust) and trust in the police (institutional trust). We address endogeneity in the use of SNS by exploiting the variation in the availability of broadband for high-speed Internet, which relates to technological characteristics of the pre-existing voice telecommunication infrastructures. We find that all the forms of trust significantly decrease with participation in online networks. We discuss several interpretations of the results in light of the specific features of Internet-mediated social interaction.

<title>Market integration reduces kin density in women's ego-networks in rural Poland</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-14158-2</url>
<snippet>It is widely assumed that as populations become more market integrated the 'inner circles' of people's social networks become less densely connected and family-oriented. This 'loosening' of kin networks may fundamentally alter the social dynamics of reproduction, facilitating demographic transitions to low fertility. Few data exist to test this hypothesis. Previous research in urbanized populations has not explicitly measured kin density in ego-networks, nor assessed how market integration influences network structure at different levels of aggregation. Here I analyze the ego-networks of similar to 2000 women in 22 rural Polish communities transitioning from subsistence farming to market-dependence. I compare how ego-network size, density and kin density co-vary with household and community-level market integration. Market integration is associated with less kin-dense networks, but not necessarily less dense ones, and is unrelated to network size. Declining kin density during economic transitions may be a critical mechanism for the broader cultural transmission of low fertility values. Market integration may loosen the dense kinship networks maintaining high fertility among agriculturalists, but data are lacking. Here, Colleran shows that in 22 rural Polish communities, women's ego networks are less kin-oriented, but not less dense, as market integration increases, potentially enabling low fertility values to spread.

<title>Neither influence nor selection: Examining co-evolution of political orientation and social networks in the NetSense and NetHealth studies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233458</url>
<snippet>Political orientation is one of the most important and consequential individual attributes studied by social scientists. Yet, we know relatively little about the temporal evolution of political orientation, especially at periods in the life course during which individuals are forming new social relationships and transitioning to new relational contexts. Here we use Stochastic Actor-Oriented models (SAOMs) to examine the co-evolution of political orientation and social networks using two feature-rich, temporal network datasets from samples of students making the transition to college at the University of Notre Dame (i.e. the NetSense and NetHealth studies). Overall, we find a great deal of stability in political orientation, with a slight tendency for the 2011 NetSense study participants to become more conservative during their first four semesters in college, but not the 2015 NetHealth study participants. Partisanship is the best predictor of changes in political orientation, with students who identify or vote as Republicans becoming more conservative over time. Neither network influence nor selection processes seem to be driving observed changes. During this formative period, relatively stable identities such as party affiliation predict changes in political orientation independently of local network dynamics, selection processes, socio-demographic traits, and dispositional factors.

<title>Global Network Inference from Ego Network Samples: Testing a Simulation Approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2014.994621</url>
<snippet>Network sampling poses a radical idea: that it is possible to measure global network structure without the full population coverage assumed in most network studies. Network sampling is only useful, however, if a researcher can produce accurate global network estimates. This article explores the practicality of making network inference, focusing on the approach introduced in Smith (2012). The method uses sampled ego network data and simulation techniques to make inference about the global features of the true, unknown network. The validity check here includes more difficult scenarios than previous tests, including those that go beyond the initial scope conditions of the method. I examine networks with a skewed degree distribution and surveys that limit the number of social ties a respondent can list. For each network/survey combination, I take a random ego network sample, run the simulation method, and compare the results to the true values (using measures of connectivity and cohesion). I also test the method on local measures of network structure. The results, on the whole, are encouraging. The method produces good estimates even in cases where the degree distribution is skewed and the survey is strongly restricted. I also find that is it better to not truncate the survey if possible. If the survey must be restricted, the researcher would do well to infer the missing data, rather than use the raw data naively.

<title>Influencing dynamics on social networks without knowledge of network microstructure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2021.0435</url>
<snippet>Social network-based information campaigns can be used for promoting beneficial health behaviours and mitigating polarization (e.g. regarding climate change or vaccines). Network-based intervention strategies typically rely on full knowledge of network structure. It is largely not possible or desirable to obtain population-level social network data due to availability and privacy issues. It is easier to obtain information about individuals' attributes (e.g. age, income), which are jointly informative of an individual's opinions and their social network position. We investigate strategies for influencing the system state in a statistical mechanics based model of opinion formation. Using synthetic and data-based examples we illustrate the advantages of implementing coarse-grained influence strategies on Ising models with modular structure in the presence of external fields. Our work provides a scalable methodology for influencing Ising systems on large graphs and the first exploration of the Ising influence problem in the presence of ambient (social) fields. By exploiting the observation that strong ambient fields can simplify control of networked dynamics, our findings open the possibility of efficiently computing and implementing public information campaigns using insights from social network theory without costly or invasive levels of data collection.

<title>Untangling the team social capital-team innovation link: The role of proportional task conflict as well as group- and differentiated individual-focused transformational leadership</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00187267221080995</url>
<snippet>Findings from prior research on the relationship between a team's social network architecture and team innovation have been inconclusive. Integrating social network theory with input-process-output models of team innovation, our research aims to reconcile the mixed findings in the literature by introducing a novel process perspective as well as highlighting a relevant contingency factor to untangle the team social capital-team innovation link. We propose that team social capital, operationalized as bridging and bonding social capital, negatively influences team innovation via team proportional task conflict, which is the level of task conflict teams experience proportional to the general level of team conflict (i.e. task, relationship and process conflict). In addition, we expected group and differentiated individual-focused transformational leadership to buffer the negative indirect effect of team social capital on team innovation via team proportional task conflict. Results from time-lagged data collected from research and development teams in Iraq revealed that teams with bonding and bridging social capital are less innovative because they experience less proportional task conflict. Furthermore, group-focused transformational leadership buffered the negative indirect relationship of team bridging social capital on team innovation via proportional task conflict. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

<title>Do social ties foster firms' environmental innovation? The moderating effect of resource bricolage</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2020.1821876</url>
<snippet>While social ties are central to the field of innovation, the research on the relationship between social ties and environmental innovation is lacking. Based on the resource-based view and social network theory, we construct a research model for identifying the relationships between social ties, resource bricolage, and environmental innovation; we use this to examine the impacts of business, political, and research and development (R&amp;D) ties on firms' levels of radical and incremental eco-innovation, as well as the moderating role of resource bricolage. Multiple regression analysis using survey data from 289 Chinese manufacturing firms is conducted. The results show that political and R&amp;D ties can effectively promote radical eco-innovation, while business and political ties promote incremental eco-innovation. Furthermore, resource bricolage plays a positive moderating role in the relationships between firms' political ties and environmental innovation. These conclusions have certain implications for firms, offering useful insight on how to take full advantage of social ties to acquire various resources and harness resource bricolage strategies to support environmental innovation.

<title>Perceived group cohesion versus actual social structure: A study using social network analysis of egocentric Facebook networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2018.04.004</url>
<snippet>Research on group cohesion often relies on individual perceptions, which may not reflect the actual social structure of groups. This study draws on social network theory to examine the relationship between observable structural group characteristics and individual perceptions of group cohesion. Leveraging Facebook data, we extracted and partitioned the social networks of 109 participants into groups using a modularity algorithm. We then surveyed perceptions of cohesion, and computed group density and size using social network analysis. Out of six linear mixed effects models specified, a random intercept and fixed slope model with group size as a predictor of perceived group cohesion emerged as best fitting. Whereas group density was not linked to perceived cohesion, size had a small negative effect on perceived cohesion, suggesting that people perceive smaller groups as more cohesive. We discuss the potential of social network analysis, visualization tools, and Facebook data for advancing research on groups.

<title>When is brokerage negatively associated with economic benefits? Ethnic diversity, competition, and common-pool resources</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2015.11.004</url>
<snippet>There is a growing body of literature positively linking dimensions of social capital to economic benefits. Yet recent research also points to a potential "dark side" of social capital, where over-embeddedness in networks and the pressures associated with brokerage are hypothesized to constrain actors, having a negative effect on economic outcomes. This dichotomy suggests that context is important, yet the overwhelming majority of existing empirical evidence stems from socially homogenous populations in corporate and organizational settings, limiting a broader understanding of when and how context matters. We advance this discourse to a socially fragmented, ethnically diverse common-pool resource system where information is highly valuable and competition is fierce. Merging several unique datasets from Hawaii's pelagic tuna fishery, we find that network prominence, i.e., being well connected locally, has a significant, positive effect on economic productivity. In contrast, we find that brokerage, defined here as ties that bridge either structurally distinct or ethnically distinct groups, has a significant, negative effect. Taken together, our results provide empirical support to widespread claims of the value of information access in common-pool resource systems, yet suggest that in ethnically diverse, competitive environments, brokers may be penalized for sharing information across social divides. Our results thus contribute to an emerging theory on the fragile nature of brokerage that recognizes its potential perils and the importance of context. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<snippet>We put forward a computational multi-agent model capturing the impact of social network structure on individuals' social trust, willingness to cooperate, social utility and economic performance. Social network structure is modeled as four distinct social capital dimensions: degree, centrality, bridging and bonding social capital. Model setup draws from socio-economic theory and empirical findings based on our novel survey dataset. Results include aggregate-level comparative statics and individual-level correlations. We find, inter alia, that societies that either are better connected, exhibit a lower frequency of local cliques, or have a smaller share of family-based cliques, record relatively better aggregate economic performance. As long as family ties are sufficiently valuable, there is a trade-off between aggregate social utility and economic performance, and small world networks are then socially optimal. We also find that in dense networks and trustful societies, there is a trade-off between individual social utility and economic performance; otherwise both outcomes are positively correlated in the cross section.

<title>Social support and career optimism: Examining the effectiveness of network groups among black managers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/001872679805100903</url>
<snippet>As companies look for better ways to manage diversity, one of the approaches that is emerging is the use of female and minority network groups. These groups are not well understood, and there has been no quantitative analysis of their impact on minority employees. Social network theory suggests that network groups should enhance the social resources available to women and minorities and in that way enhance their chance of career success, but some critics of network groups suggest that backlash might produce greater social isolation and discrimination. In this paper, we analyze a survey of members of the National Black MBA Association to find out whether network groups have a positive impact on career optimism, what specific effects of these groups are most beneficial, and whether groups enhance isolation or discrimination. Results indicate that network groups have a positive overall impact on career optimism of Black managers, and that this occurs primarily via enhanced mentoring. Network groups have no effect on discrimination, either positive or negative. There are some indications of greater isolation, but also some indications of greater contact with Whites.

<title>Do women in science form more diverse research networks than men? An analysis of Spanish biomedical scientists</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238229</url>
<snippet>This paper examines the role of gender in the formation of research collaboration networks, by investigating the composition of networks through connections to diverse professional communities. Drawing on an ego network approach, we examine gender differences among researchers' networks in terms of partner diversity, openness and brokerage roles. We use data from 897 valid responses to a questionnaire administered to biomedical scientists in Spain, which enquired into multiple aspects of personal research networks. Our findings show that women form more diverse networks and brokerage triads than men. This result is reinforced if we consider the most heterogeneous brokerage triads in terms of professional differences among network partners (i.e., consultant and liaison). Our results suggest that women are more likely to access non-redundant knowledge and richer research perspectives via their knowledge-flow intermediary roles. This research suggests the need for analyses of gender and networks that go beyond a gender-to-gender approach.

<title>OPINION DIFFUSION ON MULTILAYER SOCIAL NETWORKS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219525917500151</url>
<snippet>In this paper, to reveal the influence of multilayer network structure on opinion diffusion in social networks, we study an opinion dynamics model based on DeGroot model on multilayer networks. We find that if the influence matrix integrating the information of connectedness for each layer and correlation between layers is strongly connected and aperiodic, all agents' opinions will reach a consensus. However, if there are stubborn agents in the networks, regular agents' opinions will finally be confined to the convex combinations of the stubborn agents'. Specifically, if all stubborn agents hold the same opinion, even if the agents only exist on a certain layer, their opinions will diffuse to the entire multilayer networks. This paper not only characterizes the influence of multilayer network topology and agent attribute on opinion diffusion in a holistic way, but also demonstrates the importance of coupling agents which play an indispensable role in some social and economic situations.

<title>How and why: complementary analyses of social network structures and cultural values: improving flood response networks in Queensland, Australia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-013-9982-6</url>
<snippet>Social network analysis (SNA) is well recognized as a tool for informing climate change adaptation; however, this methodology is limited by a focus on quantitative structural analyses (how many nodes and ties exist, and between whom), rather than accessing richer information about their meaning (value content of ties). One way to improve the usefulness of SNA is to purposefully complement the structural analysis with cultural elements that can be drawn from field datasets. In this network-governance case study from Queensland, Australia, research on organizations involved in water management and flood responses events showed that cultural values were important in influencing network connections and preferred approaches to flood pre-planning and response. For example, there were differences in organizational preferences for the numbers and types of links that are rooted in different values. From this, Mary Douglas' Cultural Theory categories of individualists, hierarchists, and egalitarians were extended to analyze the types of ties between network nodes, the preferred approaches of different types of organization, and the problematic links and missing links among network nodes. This work illustrates that analyses of both structural SNA and cultural values can be used to improve regional-level adaptation activities such as disaster management. Here, increased knowledge about social networks, network ties, and cultural values can facilitate a process of social learning that will help societies adapt to climate change impacts.

<title>Rules of the Game: Exponential Random Graph Models of a Gang Homicide Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/soz106</url>
<snippet>Gang members frequently refer to street life as a "game" (or "The Game"): a social milieu in which status is lost or won by the way individuals and groups manage their reputations. Like other games, successfully participating in the street game may demand adherence to certain rules, such as the willingness to violently redress threats, the avoidance of "weak" behaviors, and the protection of one's allies. This paper draws on detailed police records of violent exchanges among gangs in Chicago to ascertain which rules of the game in fact contribute to the relative social standing of groups. Specifically, we use exponential random graph models to identify the underlying micro-arrangements among gangs that collectively generate macro-level patterns of homicide. Findings illuminate a large and diverse array of generative mechanisms based on gangs' attributes and structural positions. However, these mechanisms vary depending on which two gangs are at hand; provide evidence of a contested hierarchy with few intergroup alliances; and are surprisingly inconsistent over time. As all gangs engage in local and ongoing struggles for dominance-and as the rules constantly change-the street game is continually played but never truly won.

<title>Thinking you&amp;apos;re different matters more for belonging than being different</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58252-y</url>
<snippet>Belonging to a community is essential for wellbeing, but potentially unattainable for those dissimilar from a group. In the present work, we ask whether belongingness is better predicted by acting and thinking like peers or believing you act and think like peers. Students (N = 1181) reported their belonging and how much they, their friends, and an "average student" endorsed local behavioral norms and general values. We calculated difference scores for behaviors and values capturing perceived similarity to the average, actual similarity to the average, and accuracy around the norm. Key results indicate that perceived behavioral similarity to the average, when controlling for other differences, predicts belonging and most robustly mediates between identity and belonging. Using social network analysis, we find behavioral differences from friends are meaningfully linked to network density and racial homophily. Efficient interventions for enhanced belonging could highlight similarities between students and their peers.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179144</url>
<snippet>Studying the impact of food consumption on people's health is a serious matter for its implications on public policy, but it has traditionally been a slow process since it requires information gathered through expensive collection processes such as surveys, census and systematic reviews of research articles. We argue that this process could be supported and hastened using data collected via online social networks. In this work we investigate the relationships between the online traces left behind by users of a large US online food community and the prevalence of obesity in 47 states and 311 counties in the US. Using data associated with the recipes bookmarked over an 9-year period by 144,839 users of the Allrecipes. com food website residing throughout the US, several hierarchical regression models are created to (i) shed light on these relations and (ii) establish their magnitude. The results of our analysis provide strong evidence that bookmarking activities on recipes in online food communities can provide a signal allowing food and health related issues, such as obesity to be better understood and monitored. We discover that higher fat and sugar content in bookmarked recipes is associated with higher rates of obesity. The dataset is complicated, but strong temporal and geographical trends are identifiable. We show the importance of accounting for these trends in the modeling process.

<title>Fighting fake news in the COVID-19 era: policy insights from an equilibrium model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11077-020-09405-z</url>
<snippet>The COVID-19 crisis has revealed structural failures in governance and coordination on a global scale. With related policy interventions dependent on verifiable evidence, pandemics require governments to not only consider the input of experts but also ensure that science is translated for public understanding. However, misinformation and fake news, including content shared through social media, compromise the efficacy of evidence-based policy interventions and undermine the credibility of scientific expertise with potentially longer-term consequences. We introduce a formal mathematical model to understand factors influencing the behavior of social media users when encountering fake news. The model illustrates that direct efforts by social media platforms and governments, along with informal pressure from social networks, can reduce the likelihood that users who encounter fake news embrace and further circulate it. This study has implications at a practical level for crisis response in politically fractious settings and at a theoretical level for research about post-truth and the construction of fact.

<title>Social network analysis - centrality parameters and individual network positions of agonistic behavior in pigs over three different age levels</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40064-015-0963-1</url>
<snippet>Knowledge of the network structure of agonistic interactions helps to understand the formation and the development of aggressive behavior. Therefore, video observation data of 149 pigs over three different age levels were investigated for 2 days each directly after mixing (65 groups in the rearing area, 24 groups in the growing stable and 12 groups in the breeding stable). The aim of the study was to use network analysis to investigate the development of individual network positions of specific animals and to determine whether centrality parameters in previous mixing situations have an impact on the future behavior of the animals. The results of the weighted degree centrality indicated that weaned pigs had a higher fighting intensity directly after mixing compared to growing pigs and gilts. Also, the number of different opponents (degree centrality) was higher compared to the older age groups. The betweenness centrality showed relatively small values and no significant differences between the different age levels, whereas the closeness centrality showed high values at all observed age levels. Experiences gained in previous agonistic interactions had an impact on the centrality parameters in subsequent mixing situations. It was shown that the position of individual animals in agonistic interaction networks can be characterized using social network analysis and that changes over different age levels can be detected. Therefore, social network analysis provides insights into the formation and evolution of behavioral patterns which could be of particular interest for the identification of key factors with regard to abnormal behavior (e.g. tail biting).

<title>Firms' challenges and social responsibilities during Covid-19: A Twitter analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254748</url>
<snippet>This paper offers insights on the major issues and challenges firms face in the Covid-19 pandemic and their concerns for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) themes. To do so, we investigate large Italian firms' discussions on Twitter in the first nine months of the pandemic. Specifically, we ask: How is firms' Twitter discussion developing during the Covid-19 pandemic? Which CSR dimensions and topics do firms discuss? To what extent do they resonate with the public? We downloaded Twitter posts by the accounts of large Italian firms, and we built the bipartite network of accounts and hashtags. Using an entropy-based null model as a benchmark, we projected the information contained in the network into the accounts layers, identifying a network of accounts. We find that the network is composed of 13 communities and accounts at the core of the network focus on environmental sustainability, digital innovation, and safety. Firms' ownership type does not seem to influence the conversation. While the relevance of CSR hashtags and stakeholder engagement is relatively small, peculiarities arise in some communities. Overall, our paper highlights the contribution of online social networks and complex networks methods for management and strategy research, showing the role of online social media in understanding firms' issues, challenges, and responsibilities, with common narratives naturally emerging from data.

<title>The Dichotomy between Providing Services and Supporting Social Inclusion in the Network of Third Sector Social Service Organisations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.5477/cis/reis.178.83</url>
<snippet>Inter-organisational collaboration plays an important role in the provision of services by the third sector. In this article we analyse the relationships among 21 third sector organisations in Andalusia. Through social network analysis we evaluate centrality, cohesion, influence and brokerage in different relationship structures among these organizations. The results reveal the existence of two relational spheres: one consisting of third sector organisations that provide services to specific groups and the other of organisations that work on issues of social inclusion and participation. A limited number entities account for the majority of the relationship activities in the network, mediating between users, the third sector and public administration. These entities structure the relationships into clusters with high cohesion, facilitating control over resources and the convergence of objectives among organisations in the same sphere.

<title>Stability in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.231500</url>
<snippet>Dunbar's number is the cognitive limit of human beings to maintain stable relationships with other individuals in their social networks, and it is found to be 150. It is based on the neocortex size of humans. Usually, Dunbar's number and related phenomena are studied from the perspective of an individual. Dunbar's number also plays a crucial role in evolutionary psychology and allied areas. However, no study done so far has considered a couple who are in a stable relationship as a system from the perspective of Dunbar's number and its hierarchy layers. In this paper, we study the impact of Dunbar's number and Dunbar's hierarchy from the perspective of a couple by studying mathematically the conjoint Dunbar graphs for a couple. The cost of romance is the loss of almost two people from one's support network when a human being enters into a new relationship. Thus, we obtain mathematically that there is no significant change in one's friendship if human beings spend negligible time with their partners. Also, along with marriage and friendship development, we attempt to assess how a person's social network structure holds up over the course of a romantic relationship. The stability of personal social networks is discussed through soft set theory and balance theoretic approach.

<title>Is Together Better? Investigating the Relationship Between Network Dynamics and Congregations' Vitality and Sustainability</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13644-022-00496-z</url>
<snippet>Background Although few studies have explored predictors of congregational vitality (i.e., ministry-oriented strengths, not attendance or growth) and sustainability, inter-organizational relationships matter for organizational wellbeing because of their impact on trust, cooperation, and information access. However, investigating the relationship between social capital and congregational vitality and sustainability has not previously been possible due to data limitations. Purpose This article investigates the extent to which brokerage, or bridging together otherwise disconnected congregations, predicts congregational vitality and sustainability in an inter-congregational network of religious congregations from eight counties encompassing and surrounding a major metropolitan area in the southeastern United States. Research on social networks between organizations suggests that brokerage can have positive, negative, and curvilinear relationships with organizational outcomes, and this literature does not provide a clear expectation for how brokerage might relate with congregational vitality and sustainability. Methods OLS regressions are used to predict three forms of vitality and two forms of sustainability using inverse network constraint, a measure of brokerage, as well as a variety of control variables. Statistical significance is estimated through permutation tests, which account for the relationships between congregations. Results Results indicate that brokerage is positively associated with community vitality and that staff/volunteer sustainability is highest for congregations with moderate levels of brokerage. Brokerage does not predict spiritual vitality, relational vitality, or financial sustainability. Conclusions and Implications This article has practical implications for congregations. Bridging together otherwise disconnected congregations can provide a wide range of ideas, resources, and opportunities, and these benefits can help congregations seeking to minister in their communities. In addition, moderate levels of brokerage can provide more diverse information and resources as well as a supportive, trusting, and cooperative environment. This combination of benefits may be helpful for congregations to disclose challenges with and to seek resources related to staff/volunteer sustainability. In addition, this article contributes to the fields of: congregational studies through exploring predictors of congregational vitality and sustainability; sociology of religion through expanding research using social network analysis; inter-organizational networks, whose research on social capital and organizational outcomes is both complicated and conflicting.

<title>Don't mention it: Why people don't share job information, when they do, and why it matters</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2011.11.002</url>
<snippet>Network-based job search is especially likely to foster workplace segregation and limit status attainment when information flows through homophilous ties. This paper takes the perspective of information holders and examines how the use of strong versus weak ties - which tend to be homophilous and heterophilous, respectively - differs with characteristics of labour markets in which jobs are located. Using in-depth interviews with entry-level white collar workers I show that information holders with opportunities to mention specific jobs to specific people do so only 27&#37; of the time. Because they hesitate to share information if they are uncertain the information is specifically sought, information flows more commonly to strong ties, whose career goals are more likely to be known. Information is more likely to be shared with weak ties if it concerns occupations for which one may be specifically credentialed, since receiving relevant training serves as signal of interest in such jobs. These finding suggest that the homophily of referrals and their inequality-generating effects may vary across occupations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>How intermittent breaks in interaction improve collective intelligence</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802407115</url>
<snippet>People influence each other when they interact to solve problems. Such social influence introduces both benefits (higher average solution quality due to exploitation of existing answers through social learning) and costs (lower maximum solution quality due to a reduction in individual exploration for novel answers) relative to independent problem solving. In contrast to prior work, which has focused on how the presence and network structure of social influence affect performance, here we investigate the effects of time. We show that when social influence is intermittent it provides the benefits of constant social influence without the costs. Human subjects solved the canonical traveling salesperson problem in groups of three, randomized into treatments with constant social influence, intermittent social influence, or no social influence. Groups in the intermittent social-influence treatment found the optimum solution frequently (like groups without influence) but had a high mean performance (like groups with constant influence); they learned from each other, while maintaining a high level of exploration. Solutions improved most on rounds with social influence after a period of separation. We also show that storing subjects' best solutions so that they could be reloaded and possibly modified in subsequent rounds-a ubiquitous feature of personal productivity software-is similar to constant social influence: It increases mean performance but decreases exploration.

<title>Selection on heritable social network positions is context-dependent in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23672-1</url>
<snippet>The evolvability of sociality requires that some variation in social groups is heritable. Experiments on fly social groups find that genotypic differences in network position are largely robust to changes in the environment flies experience, while selection on network position varies across environments. Social group structure is highly variable and can be important for nearly every aspect of behavior and its fitness consequences. Group structure can be modeled using social network analysis, but we know little about the evolutionary factors shaping and maintaining variation in how individuals are embedded within their networks (i.e., network position). While network position is a pervasive target of selection, it remains unclear whether network position is heritable and can respond to selection. Furthermore, it is unclear how environmental factors interact with genotypic effects on network positions, or how environmental factors shape selection on heritable network structure. Here we show multiple measures of social network position are heritable, using replicate genotypes and replicate social groups of Drosophila melanogaster flies. Our results indicate genotypic differences in network position are largely robust to changes in the environment flies experience, though some measures of network position do vary across environments. We also show selection on multiple network position metrics depends on the environmental context they are expressed in, laying the groundwork for better understanding how spatio-temporal variation in selection contributes to the evolution of variable social group structure.

<snippet>This paper develops a framework to structurally estimate pairwise stable networks with nonnegative externality. We characterize pairwise stable equilibria as a fixed point of a certain mapping and show that the set of pairwise stable equilibria with nonnegative externality is a complete lattice. We extend the characterization to an econometric framework for structural estimation based on the moment inequality model. We apply our methodology to friendship networks of students in the United States, using data from Add-Health. We find that the preference toward racial homophily is overestimated if we do not control for the preference toward clustering. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>On the Relation between the Small World Structure and Scientific Activities</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0121129</url>
<snippet>The modern science has become more complex and interdisciplinary in its nature which might encourage researchers to be more collaborative and get engaged in larger collaboration networks. Various aspects of collaboration networks have been examined so far to detect the most determinant factors in knowledge creation and scientific production. One of the network structures that recently attracted much theoretical attention is called small world. It has been suggested that small world can improve the information transmission among the network actors. In this paper, using the data on 12 periods of journal publications of Canadian researchers in natural sciences and engineering, the co-authorship networks of the researchers are created. Through measuring small world indicators, the small worldiness of the mentioned network and its relation with researchers' productivity, quality of their publications, and scientific team size are assessed. Our results show that the examined co-authorship network strictly exhibits the small world properties. In addition, it is suggested that in a small world network researchers expand their team size through getting connected to other experts of the field. This team size expansion may result in higher productivity of the whole team as a result of getting access to new resources, benefitting from the internal referring, and exchanging ideas among the team members. Moreover, although small world network is positively correlated with the quality of the articles in terms of both citation count and journal impact factor, it is negatively related with the average productivity of researchers in terms of the number of their publications.

<title>Network Effects on Scientific Collaborations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0057546</url>
<snippet>Background: The analysis of co-authorship network aims at exploring the impact of network structure on the outcome of scientific collaborations and research publications. However, little is known about what network properties are associated with authors who have increased number of joint publications and are being cited highly. Methodology/Principal Findings: Measures of social network analysis, for example network centrality and tie strength, have been utilized extensively in current co-authorship literature to explore different behavioural patterns of co-authorship networks. Using three SNA measures (i.e., degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality), we explore scientific collaboration networks to understand factors influencing performance (i.e., citation count) and formation (tie strength between authors) of such networks. A citation count is the number of times an article is cited by other articles. We use co-authorship dataset of the research field of 'steel structure' for the year 2005 to 2009. To measure the strength of scientific collaboration between two authors, we consider the number of articles co-authored by them. In this study, we examine how citation count of a scientific publication is influenced by different centrality measures of its co-author(s) in a co-authorship network. We further analyze the impact of the network positions of authors on the strength of their scientific collaborations. We use both correlation and regression methods for data analysis leading to statistical validation. We identify that citation count of a research article is positively correlated with the degree centrality and betweenness centrality values of its co-author(s). Also, we reveal that degree centrality and betweenness centrality values of authors in a co-authorship network are positively correlated with the strength of their scientific collaborations. Conclusions/Significance: Authors' network positions in co-authorship networks influence the performance (i.e., citation count) and formation (i.e., tie strength) of scientific collaborations.

<title>Sources of Friendship and Structurally Induced Homophily across the Life Course</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0731121419828399</url>
<snippet>How people meet new friends changes throughout life in ways that change the potential for diverse friendships. This study presents results from the first U.S. survey with data on how respondents met their friends, specifically the two nonfamily friends they most often socialize with. The most common sources of new friendships shift across life from the dominance of schooling during youth, to the centrality of work in midlife, to neighbors and voluntary groups in later life. Educational homophily peaks for friendships made in midlife, and is strongest for friendships made in higher education and at work. Racial homophily generally declines as people age but is lowest for men in midlife, while decreasing later for women. Friendship sources largely account for life course changes in racial homophily, but not educational homophily. The racial homophily induced by friendship sources also changes as people age, but in different ways for women and men.

<title>Learning in social networks: Selecting profitable choices among alternatives of uncertain profitability in various networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2015.04.011</url>
<snippet>Social capital theory assumes that information is valuable. However, only rarely is this value explicitly modeled, and there are few examples of empirical tests of mechanisms that connect social network structure to valuable information. We model an individual decision problem in which individuals make choices that yield uncertain outcomes. The individuals can learn about the profitability of options from their own choices and from the network. We generate computer-simulated data to derive hypotheses about the effect of network characteristics on making profitable choices. We conduct a laboratory experiment to empirically test these hypotheses and find that, at the individual level, degree centrality has a positive effect on making profitable choices whereas betweenness centrality has no effect. At the network level, density has a positive effect on making profitable choices, whereas centralization does not have an effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Modelling opinion dynamics in the age of algorithmic personalisation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-43830-2</url>
<snippet>Modern technology has drastically changed the way we interact and consume information. For example, online social platforms allow for seamless communication exchanges at an unprecedented scale. However, we are still bounded by cognitive and temporal constraints. Our attention is limited and extremely valuable. Algorithmic personalisation has become a standard approach to tackle the information overload problem. As result, the exposure to our friends' opinions and our perception about important issues might be distorted. However, the effects of algorithmic gatekeeping on our hyper-connected society are poorly understood. Here, we devise an opinion dynamics model where individuals are connected through a social network and adopt opinions as function of the view points they are exposed to. We apply various filtering algorithms that select the opinions shown to each user (i) at random (ii) considering time ordering or (iii) its current opinion. Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between such mechanisms and crucial features of real networks. We found that algorithmic filtering might influence opinions' share and distributions, especially in case information is biased towards the current opinion of each user. These effects are reinforced in networks featuring topological and spatial correlations where echo chambers and polarisation emerge. Conversely, heterogeneity in connectivity patterns reduces such tendency. We consider also a scenario where one opinion, through nudging, is centrally pushed to all users. Interestingly, even minimal nudging is able to change the status quo moving it towards the desired view point. Our findings suggest that simple filtering algorithms might be powerful tools to regulate opinion dynamics taking place on social networks.

<title>The Emergence and Stability of Groups in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.10.008</url>
<snippet>An important puzzle in social network research is to explain how macro-level structures emerge from micro-level network processes. Explaining the emergence and stability of structural groups in social networks is particularly difficult for two reasons. First, because groups are characterized both by high connectedness within (group cohesion) and lack of connectedness between them (group boundaries). Second, because a large number of theoretical micro-level network processes contribute to their emergence. We argue that traditional social network theories that are concerned with the evolution of positive relations (forces of attraction) are not sufficient to explain the emergence of groups because they lack mechanisms explaining the emergence of group boundaries. Models that additionally account for the evolution of negative ties (forces of repulsion) may be better suited to explain the emergence and stability of groups. We build a theoretical model and illustrate its usefulness by fitting stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs) to empirical data of co-evolving networks of friendship and dislike among 479 secondary-school students. The SAOMs include a number of newly developed effects expressing the co-evolution between positive and negative ties. We then simulate networks from the estimated models to explore the micro-macro link. We find that a model that considers forces of attraction and repulsion simultaneously is better at explaining groups in social networks. In the long run, however, the empirically informed simulations generate networks that are too stylized to be realistic, raising further questions about model degeneracy and time heterogeneity of group processes.

<snippet>While there is increasing recognition of the positive impacts of tourism on economic development in Sub-Saharan Africa, existing relationships between tourism industry stakeholders is fraught with challenges that constrain its development. Drawing on social network theory and stakeholder theory and through a series of key informant semi-structured interviews with tourism industry stakeholders, the paper explores the nature of participation by destination stakeholders in formulating and implementing tourism policy in Cameroon. It then explores a model of tourism development built around a centrally coordinated but decentralized tourism network that reaches out to all representative stakeholders when formulating and implementing tourism policies. The challenges involved in mobilizing destination stakeholders into such a system to allow for effective tourism development are critically examined.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2024.2319602</url>
<snippet>The overall synergy of technical-link-based cooperative innovation has the potential to drive industrial competitiveness, yet there is a gap in the knowledge of the cooperative innovation subnetworks based on various key technical links in a modular manufacturing industry. This study scrutinised the structure and coordination of three key technical-link-based subnetworks in the Chinese NEV industry by an empirical analysis based on joint patent data from 2009 to 2019 and a composite coordination measurement model. The findings indicate that the cooperative relationship within the three sub-networks all become closer to the obvious 'core-periphery' structure since 2016, with a downward trend in network density. The coordination of the three subnetworks has gradually changed from an uncoordinated degree to a low-coordinated degree, and the battery technology subnetwork has a generally lower-order degree. Some suggestions for improving the overall coordination are provided. Our study contributes to a better understanding of cooperation network dynamics with a lens of improving the balance in structural properties from technical-link-based subnetworks in a modular manufacturing industry.

<title>The role of crowdsourcing in product design: The moderating effect of user expertise and network connectivity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101496</url>
<snippet>To meet the challenges of customization and personalized design in the context of the digital economy, increasing numbers of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are using crowdsourcing platforms to seek product design innovation. While crowdsourcing has significant potential for eliciting product ideas, it remains unclear whether it can generate high-quality designs for relatively more complex product design tasks. Based on a leading social new product development website Quirky.com, we explore the antecedents of a firm?s adoption decision of crowdsourcing, the impact of crowdsourcing on product design quality, and the moderating effect of user expertise and network connectivity by utilizing treatment effect model. The results indicate that: (1) crowdsourcing has a significant positive impact on product design quality; (2) user expertise positively moderates the role of crowdsourcing in product design quality; (3) network connectivity has an inverted U-shaped moderating effect on crowdsourcing and product design quality relationship; (4) the probability of firm?s crowdsourcing adoption is negatively correlated with the complexity and reliability of initial product idea but positively correlated with popularity, novelty, and numbers of images. This study not only enriches the crowdsourcing and social network theory; but also provides guidance for crowdsourcing platform firms to better manage the crowdsourcing process and user crowdsourcing communities.

<title>Networks and institutions in sustainable forest use: Evidence from South-East Tanzania</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.03.002</url>
<snippet>Despite growing interest in the impacts of both forest certification and networks in effective natural resource management, there is little literature that brings these two lines of inquiry together. Combining longitudinal remote sensing and village-level forest governance network data, we estimate Cox proportional hazard models predicting the risk of forest loss within 100-square meter forest plots in areas that eventually came under Forest Stewardship Council certification. Our models indicate Forest Stewardship Council certification substantially reduces deforestation, despite that the system is not explicitly designed to do so. While villages with ties to civil society organizations also tend to experience reduced deforestation, those with ties to private sector organizations experience more forest loss. Further, we find that forest loss declines as the share of closed triangles in villages' governance networks increases. Our results indicate network structure may complement Forest Stewardship Council certification's impact on forest cover and account for some reduction in deforestation previously attributed to certification itself.

In particular, the focus is on Polish researchers in economics, who need 'catch-up strategies' to aid them in publishing papers in international journals. Brokerage is identified as one of the most important correlatives of publishing success. However, in many cases, the best performers are smart collaborators who take advantage of the benefits of both bridging and bonding social capital. In general, co-authorship itself does not provide an advantage. Instead, a proper collaboration strategy appears to be more important. Additionally, embeddedness of authors within their affiliations should be considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

During the epidemic of a vaccine-preventable disease, individuals in a social network can perceive the infection risks based on global information announced by public health authorities, or local information obtained from their social neighbors. After that, they can rationally decide whether or not to take the vaccine through weighing the relative cost of vaccination and infection (i.e., relative vaccine cost). In this case, both social network structure and individuals' risk perception strategies will affect the final vaccine coverage. In this paper, we focus on the problem of how individuals' perceptions on epidemic severity affect their vaccinating behaviors in the face of flu-like seasonal diseases in social networks, and vice versa. Specifically, we first present three types of static decision-making mechanisms, each of which simulates human vaccinating behaviors based on different local/global information. On this basis, we further present a reinforcement-learning-based mechanism, where individuals can use their historical vaccination experiences to determine what information is more suitable to estimate the severity of the epidemic. Finally, we carry out simulations on three types of social networks to investigate the effects of network structure, source of information, relative vaccine cost, and individual social connections on the final vaccine coverage and epidemic size. The results and findings can provide a new insight for designing incentive-based vaccination policies and intervention strategies for flu-like seasonal diseases.

<title>Emergence of Small-World Networks in an Overlapping-Generations Model of Social Dynamics, Trust and Economic Performance</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4178</url>
<snippet>We study the impact of endogenous creation and destruction of social ties in an artificial society on aggregate outcomes such as generalized trust, willingness to cooperate, social utility and economic performance. To this end we put forward a computational multi-agent model where agents of overlapping generations interact in a dynamically evolving social network. In the model, four distinct dimensions of individuals' social capital: degree, centrality, heterophilous and homophilous interactions, determine their generalized trust and willingness to cooperate, altogether helping them achieve certain levels of social utility (i.e., utility from social contacts) and economic performance. We find that the stationary state of the simulated social network exhibits realistic small-world topology. We also observe that societies whose social networks are relatively frequently reconfigured, display relatively higher generalized trust, willingness to cooperate, and economic performance - at the cost of lowersocial utility. Similar outcomes are found for societies where social tie dissolution is relatively weakly linked to family closeness.

<title>Friendship by assignment? From formal interdependence to informal relations in organizations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0018726718789479</url>
<snippet>We offer the first field experiment showing how job assignments create social ties at work and influence their persistence. Pairs of managers were assigned at random to project teams. We show that once those pairs work together and become interdependent, they are more likely to create informal relationships (friendships and advice ties). Interdependence also increases the persistence of the informal ties that existed prior to team assignments; the magnitude of this effect decreases with tie strength. As organizations extend their use of teamwork, they also create and maintain social networks across functional and geographic boundaries. Thus, transitory project teams forge an enduring organizational legacy.

<title>Beyond Frogs and Scorpions: A Risk-Based Framework for Understanding Negotiating Counterparts' Ethical Motivations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1571-9979.2012.00348.x</url>
<snippet>Managing the flow of valid information is one of the biggest challenges that negotiators face. The high incidence of questionable or unethical negotiating tactics has been well documented, but ways of dealing with the deceptive practices of a counterpart have received comparatively little attention. In this article, we suggest that, in addition to avoidance and confrontation, negotiators typically attempt to manage the unethical tendencies of their counterparts through twelve neutralizing approaches. These approaches are based on four types of perceived risk that counterparts often consider when deciding whether to use ethically ambiguous negotiation tactics: risks to immediate or short-term goals/tasks; risks to immediate or short-term relationship(s); risks to future or long-term goals/tasks; and, risks to future or long-term relationships. By applying expectancy theory, resource dependency theory, social identity theory, and social network theory to this framework, we have developed propositions related to these twelve neutralizing approaches. We also discuss the opportunities and challenges related to evaluating these propositions in future research.

<title>The 'friendship dynamics of religion,' or the 'religious dynamics of friendship'? A social network analysis of adolescents who attend small schools</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2012.03.014</url>
<snippet>Longitudinal social network data on adolescents in seven schools are analyzed to reach a new understanding about how the personal and interpersonal social dimensions of adolescent religion intertwine together in small school settings. We primarily address two issues relevant to the sociology of religion and.sociology in general: (1) social selection as a source of religious homophily and (2) friend socialization of religion. Analysis results are consistent with Collins interaction ritual chain theory, which stresses the social dimensions of religion, since network-religion autocorrelations are relatively substantial in magnitude and both selection and socialization mechanisms play key roles in generating them. Results suggest that socialization plays a stronger role than social selection in four of six religious outcomes, and that more religious youth are more cliquish. Implications for our understanding of the social context of religion, religious homophily, and the ways we model religious influence, as well as limitations and considerations for future research, are discussed.

<title>Bringing Managers Back In: Managerial Influences on Workplace Inequality</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122411420814</url>
<snippet>While great progress has been made in documenting that organizational practices affect workplace inequality, little is known about how managers in particular may shape the careers of the employees below them. Using unique longitudinal personnel data on managers and their subordinates, this study identifies and tests for evidence of three distinct mechanisms by which managers potentially influence the assessment of employee performance in the workplace: (1) social network influence between employees' current and former managers; (2) manager-manager (horizontal) homophily; and (3) manager-employee (vertical) homophily. I find evidence of the independent effects of all three mechanisms of managerial influence on the outcome of disagreement in the performance evaluation ratings of the same worker between former and current managers. In particular, my results stress that both managerial network influence and horizontal homophily affect the process of employee performance assessments, over and above the well-studied vertical homophily mechanism. I conclude by discussing the theoretical implications of these findings for future research regarding the interactional aspects of workplace inequality within contemporary organizations.

<title>Dementia Caregiving in the Context of Late-Life Remarriage: Support Networks, Relationship Quality, and Well-being</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12059</url>
<snippet>Caregiving research has not accounted for increasingly diverse and complex marital and family histories of older Americans. The authors examined social relations and care-specific positive and negative support networks among late-life remarried wife dementia caregivers (N = 61) to determine associations among network structure, relationship quality with and support received from network members, and global assessments of family and stepfamily disagreement on caregiver well-being. Own family and friends predominated in the social relations and positive networks. Although over half (54&#37;) of respondents included a stepfamily member in their positive networks, stepchildren comprised the largest group (35&#37;) in the negative networks. Larger negative networks and actively negative interactions were related to greater caregiver burden, and more global disagreement with stepfamily was associated with greater depression and burden. The findings illustrate the complex nature of support and the value of targeted examinations of caregiving support dynamics among late-life remarried older adults and stepfamilies facing health demands.

<title>A Theoretical Examination of Homophily Beyond Focus Theory: Causes, Consequences, and New Directions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440231173915</url>
<snippet>Scott Feld's focus theory stimulated one of the most important traditions in the study of the concept of homophily in connection to individual action and network behavior across sociology and organizational studies. This article uses Feld's focus theory as a starting point of reference to examine the major theoretical developments and empirical applications of homophily since his pioneering work. First, this article interrogates the causes of homophily by examining structured versus social psychological preference for similarity as two prominent explanatory mechanisms for homophily. Second, this article scopes out the consequences of homophily by examining the advantages and disadvantages of homophily for individual action and network behavior. Finally, building on the previous sections, this article proposes new areas for the study of homophily: deleterious psychosocial consequences of homophily, the role of multiplexity in causing homophily, and the disaggregation of homophily in general into different, nuanced (potentially interacting) types of homophily. This article thus contributes to the literature by offering a critical juncture to examine the key arguments that have guided the study of homophily since Feld's focus theory and an important launching point for future research on the concept of homophily and its applications.

<title>Reconsidering evidence of moral contagion in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01133-5</url>
<snippet>The ubiquity of social media use and the digital data traces it produces has triggered a potential methodological shift in the psychological sciences away from traditional, laboratory-based experimentation. The hope is that, by using computational social science methods to analyse large-scale observational data from social media, human behaviour can be studied with greater statistical power and ecological validity. However, current standards of null hypothesis significance testing and correlational statistics seem ill-suited to markedly noisy, high-dimensional social media datasets. We explore this point by probing the moral contagion phenomenon, whereby the use of moral-emotional language increases the probability of message spread. Through out-of-sample prediction, model comparisons and specification curve analyses, we find that the moral contagion model performs no better than an implausible XYZ contagion model. This highlights the risks of using purely correlational evidence from large observational datasets and sounds a cautionary note for psychology's merge with big data. Burton et al. probe the question of moral contagion through out-of-sample prediction, model comparisons and specification curve analyses, demonstrating the limitations of conclusions based on large-scale, observational social media datasets alone.

<title>Intergenerational Closure and Academic Achievement in High School: A New Evaluation of Coleman's Conjecture</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/003804070908200304</url>
<snippet>This article reexamines the conjecture of James S. Coleman that intergenerational social closure promotes student achievement in high schools, analyzing the best national data on academic achievement and social networks: the 2002 and 2004 waves of the Education Longitudinal Study. The results show that within the Catholic school sector, schools that are characterized by dense parental networks have substantially higher average student achievement. This association can be reduced but not eliminated by conditioning on available measures of student network structure and standard measures of family background. In contrast, in the public school sector, a similarly strong bivariate association between dense parental networks and student achievement can be attributed almost entirely to these basic conditioning variables. These results represent, at best, a mixed verdict for Coleman's predictions. Intergenerational closure in its currently observed form does not increase achievement in public schools, suggesting that parental monitoring of discipline does not outweigh some of the costs of parental closure. However, intergenerational closure may increase achievement in Catholic schools to a modest degree because Catholic schools are affiliated with religious communities that have appropriable norms.

<title>The evolution of k-shell in syndication networks reveals financial of venture institutions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.09.006</url>
<snippet>Venture capital (VC) is a relatively newly emergent industry that is still subject to large uncertainties in China. Therefore, building a robust social network with other VC institutions is a good way to share information, various resources, and benefit from skill and knowledge complementarity to against risks. Strong evidences indicate that better networked VC institutions are of a better financial performance, however, most of previous works overlook the evolution of VC institutions and only focus on some simple topology indicators of the static syndication network, which also neglects higher-order network structure and cannot give a comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, based on VC investment records in the Chinese market, we construct temporal syndication networks between VC institutions year by year. As k-shell decomposition considers higher-order connection patterns, we employ k-shell as an evaluation of the influence of VC institutions in syndication networks. By clustering time series of k-shell values, the VC institutions in China fall into five groups that are quite different from each other on financial performances and investment behaviors. This, in turn, proves the power of our method that only based on proper sequential network properties, we can reveal their financial investment performance. Compared to other network centrality measurements, k-shell is a better indicator that is indicated by a smaller intra-group distance and a larger inter-group distance.

<title>Performance of Social Network Sensors during Hurricane Sandy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0117288</url>
<snippet>Information flow during catastrophic events is a critical aspect of disaster management. Modern communication platforms, in particular online social networks, provide an opportunity to study such flow and derive early-warning sensors, thus improving emergency preparedness and response. Performance of the social networks sensor method, based on topological and behavioral properties derived from the "friendship paradox", is studied here for over 50 million Twitter messages posted before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy. We find that differences in users' network centrality effectively translate into moderate awareness advantage (up to 26 hours); and that geo-location of users within or outside of the hurricane-affected area plays a significant role in determining the scale of such an advantage. Emotional response appears to be universal regardless of the position in the network topology, and displays characteristic, easily detectable patterns, opening a possibility to implement a simple "sentiment sensing" technique that can detect and locate disasters.

<title>Social Network Position Moderates the Relationship between Late-life Depressive Symptoms and Memory Differently in Men and Women</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-42388-3</url>
<snippet>Late-life depression has been considered to be associated with memory deficits and hippocampal volume reduction. Considering that not all depression patients undergo the same amount of cognitive impairment or regional brain volume loss, moderating factors such as complex mental activity and social activity have been examined to assess whether these factors attenuate the detrimental impact of depressive symptoms on cognitive function and regional brain volume. However, the premise that a cognitively stimulating experience may modify the association between depressive symptoms and memory or hippocampal volume has not been investigated using social network data, which would reflect individuals' concrete characteristic of everyday social activity. In a social network, a brokerage position which connects two otherwise unconnected others demands mental and physical efforts. Using complete social network data in an entire village in South Korea, we examined whether opportunities for brokerage in social networks alter the negative association between depressive symptoms and episodic memory function or hippocampal volume in older adults. Initially, 125 participants were included in the analysis involving episodic memory function. Then, of which 65 participants completed the MRI scan, and were included in the subsequent analysis containing the hippocampal volume. Furthermore, we investigated the gender-specific effect of brokerage based on the previously reported gender difference in the effect of social networks. We found a gender-specific moderating effect of brokerage. For men, a large opportunity for brokerage weakened the negative association between depressive symptoms and memory performance and left hippocampal volume. In contrast, women showed that a large opportunity for brokerage was not beneficial for assuaging the impact of depressive symptoms on memory performance and hippocampal volume. In women, the opportunity for brokerage was positively associated with the detrimental impact of depressive symptoms on memory performance and hippocampal volume. Our findings suggest that occupying a bridging position in a social network may minimize the impact of depressive symptoms on memory function and hippocampal volume among older men, whereas the opposite holds true for older women.

<title>Transitions of women's substance use recovery networks and 12-month sobriety outcomes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2020.04.003</url>
<snippet>Little is known about how the structure and composition of women's personal social networks (PSNs) combine to support recovery from substance use disorders, how PSNs change during early recovery, or how known covariates such as trauma, co-occurring mental health disorders, or treatment modality impact this relationship. This study used latent profile and transition analyses with 6 recovery-specific PSN indicators in a sample of women in early recovery (N = 377) to identify three PSN typologies in relation to abstinence outcomes over 12 months, and track transitions between the typologies at 0-6 and 6-12 months. Women in the Highly Connected type (14.3 &#37;) had tightly-knit networks, more sober alters, and fewer treatment-related alters. Women in the Treatment-Related type (49.3 &#37;) had looser-knit networks with more sober and sobriety-supporting alters and alters they know from treatment. Women in the At-Risk type (36.3 &#37;) had more isolates, few sobriety-supporting alters, and more alters with whom they used. Women in the Treatment-Related Sobriety Support type were significantly more likely to maintain sobriety by 12 months (B=-0.81; OR = 2.09, 95 &#37; CI [1.23-3.56]) than women in the At Risk type. Higher mean Trauma Symptom Checklist scores were positively related to membership in the At Risk type. The majority of women who transitioned did so by 6 months, with 41.6 &#37; transitioning then. Women in the At Risk group had the highest probability of transition (P = 0.55). Being in residential treatment (versus outpatient) predicted lower odds of transitioning (B = -0.81, p = .06). This study provides a framework for conducting longitudinal latent variable analysis with social network data, and offers a clinically-useful starting point for research on individualized, targeted, and stage-based interventions for women in recovery.

<title>Predicting future conflict between team-members with parameter-free models of social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep01999</url>
<snippet>Despite the well-documented benefits of working in teams, teamwork also results in communication, coordination and management costs, and may lead to personal conflict between team members. In a context where teams play an increasingly important role, it is of major importance to understand conflict and to develop diagnostic tools to avert it. Here, we investigate empirically whether it is possible to quantitatively predict future conflict in small teams using parameter-free models of social network structure. We analyze data of conflict appearance and resolution between 86 team members in 16 small teams, all working in a real project for nine consecutive months. We find that group-based models of complex networks successfully anticipate conflict in small teams whereas micro-based models of structural balance, which have been traditionally used to model conflict, do not.

<title>NEW REGRESSION MODELS WITH EGOCENTRIC SOCIAL NETWORK DATA: AN ANALYSIS OF POLITICAL PARTY PREFERENCE IN JAPAN</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0081175013490189</url>
<snippet>This paper introduces some regression models for a categorical dependent variable with data from egocentric social networks as covariates to analyze the determinants of the outcome for the subject and the determinants of the extent of agreement in the outcome between the subject and the people socially connected to the subject. The merits of the models introduced in this paper are their wide applicability to surveys that collect data on egocentric social networks and their ability to identify the determinants of agreement between subjects' and their friends' attitudinal or behavioral outcomes, controlling for the tendency to agree because of homophily in the choice of friends. An illustrative application from the Japanese General Social Survey data shows that several substantively distinct characteristics of egocentric networks affect subjects' political party preferences and the extent of agreement between the political party preferences of subjects and their significant others.

<title>EXPERIMENTAL GAMES ON NETWORKS: UNDERPINNINGS OF BEHAVIOR AND EQUILIBRIUM SELECTION</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA11781</url>
<snippet>In this paper, we describe a series of laboratory experiments that implement specific examples of a general network structure. Specifically, actions are either strategic substitutes or strategic complements, and participants have either complete or incomplete information about the structure of a random network. Since economic environments typically have a considerable degree of complementarity or substitutability, this framework applies to a wide variety of settings. We examine behavior and equilibrium selection. The degree of equilibrium play is striking, in particular with incomplete information. Behavior closely resembles the theoretical equilibrium whenever this is unique; when there are multiple equilibria, general features of networks, such as connectivity, clustering, and the degree of the players, help to predict informed behavior in the lab. People appear to be strongly attracted to maximizing aggregate payoffs (social efficiency), but there are forces that moderate this attraction: (1) people seem content with (in the aggregate) capturing only the lion's share of the efficient profits in exchange for reduced exposure to loss, and (2) uncertainty about the network structure makes it considerably more difficult to coordinate on a demanding, but efficient, equilibrium that is typically implemented with complete information.

<snippet>How does the connectivity afforded by new communication and transportation technologies affect entrepreneurs' geographic and social closeness to each other? Using qualitative and quantitative evidence we analyse how Chinese Canadian entrepreneurs combine the Internet and airplane travel in their business activities. Our results show that the use of new communication and transportation technologies are positively related to the creation and maintenance of 'glocalized' networks, a function of both local embeddedness and global outreach. We find that online interaction cannot replace face-to-face interaction; travel abroad is crucial for adding a human touch to glocalized networks. Moreover, while technologies help to liberate communication from being local, Internet use and travel have limited impact on the ethnic diversity of the entrepreneurs' social networks.

<title>The network structure of knowledge sharing among physicians</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-011-9494-1</url>
<snippet>This paper applies social network analysis in order to model knowledge sharing among hospital physicians. Drawing on the literature on the diffusion of innovation and cooperation in clinical settings, it aims to furnish better understanding of knowledge sharing in two directions: describing how knowledge flows and identifying individual and contextual factors which facilitate its spontaneous spreading. Used to address these issues is a link- tracing sample of about 800 Italian hospital physicians, potentially involved in prescribing a new drug. The paper represents knowledge sharing about the innovation as a network. It therefore specifies Exponential Random Graphs (ERG) or p* models to reconstruct the network structure of knowledge sharing and to test the effect of exogenous factors on the tendency to take action in the network. The results show that knowledge flows informally, exploiting mutual information-seeking relationships, and, consistently with previous studies, locally, with physicians tending to cluster in small groups of proximate and similar peers. Moreover empirical evidence is provided that the propensity to share information with colleagues is greatly affected by individual-specific characteristics, mainly by the experience in the field and the attitude toward the innovation, and by exposure to commercial communication.

<title>Static network structure can stabilize human cooperation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1400406111</url>
<snippet>The evolution of cooperation in network-structured populations has been a major focus of theoretical work in recent years. When players are embedded in fixed networks, cooperators are more likely to interact with, and benefit from, other cooperators. In theory, this clustering can foster cooperation on fixed networks under certain circumstances. Laboratory experiments with humans, however, have thus far found no evidence that fixed network structure actually promotes cooperation. Here, we provide such evidence and help to explain why others failed to find it. First, we show that static networks can lead to a stable high level of cooperation, outperforming well-mixed populations. We then systematically vary the benefit that cooperating provides to one's neighbors relative to the cost required to cooperate (b/c), as well as the average number of neighbors in the network (k). When b/c &gt; k, we observe high and stable levels of cooperation. Conversely, when b/c &lt;= k or players are randomly shuffled, cooperation decays. Our results are consistent with a quantitative evolutionary game theoretic prediction forwhen cooperation should succeed on networks and, for the first time to our knowledge, provide an experimental demonstration of the power of static network structure for stabilizing human cooperation.

<title>The Power of Social Commerce: Understanding the Role of Social Word-of-Mouth Behaviors and Flow Experience on Social Media Users' Purchase Intention</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440241278452</url>
<snippet>Social commerce has emerged as a phenomenon that supports social interaction and user-generated content, allowing individuals to make informed purchasing decisions. This study aims to identify the antecedents of the sWOM behaviors present in social network sites (SNSs). Specifically, tie strength, homophily, trust, informational, and normative influence were included as sWOM antecedents. This study provides a deeper understanding of sWOM behavior in SNSs by identifying and analyzing separately three interrelated behaviors with distinct antecedents: opinion-giving, opinion-seeking, and opinion-passing. Additionally, flow experience is proposed as a less studied antecedent that interacts with all sWOM behaviors, and simultaneously, purchase intention. Our results suggest that flow experience, followed by opinion-seeking and opinion-passing, exerts the greatest influence on purchase intention. Additionally, our findings reveal that informative and normative influence are the analyzed antecedents that have the greatest impact on purchase intention.JEL Classification: M31. This study analyzes the sequential process of evaluation and use of social networks regarding the intention to purchase products recommended by other consumers. Three types of internet behaviors are differentiated: searching for product information, sharing this information with one's contacts in social networks, and/or generating opinions and evaluations about the products. Several factors have been identified that could enhance both the three aforementioned behaviors and the final purchase intention of the product itself: tie strength, homophily, trust, informative influence, normative influence, and flow experience. The results of the study allow us to conclude that flow experience as well as opinion-seeking and opinion-passing behaviors are the factors that enhance product purchase intention the most. Of the remaining factors analyzed, the effect of informative and normative influences is most significant.

<title>Exponential random graph models for multilevel networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2013.01.004</url>
<snippet>Modern multilevel analysis, whereby outcomes of individuals within groups take into account group membership, has been accompanied by impressive theoretical development (e.g. Kozlowski and Klein, 2000) and sophisticated methodology (e.g. Snijders and Bosker, 2012). But typically the approach assumes that links between groups are non-existent, and interdependence among the individuals derives solely from common group membership. It is not plausible that such groups have no internal structure nor they have no links between each other. Networks provide a more complex representation of interdependence. Drawing on a small but crucial body of existing work, we present a general formulation of a multilevel network structure. We extend exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to multilevel networks, and investigate the properties of the proposed models using simulations which show that even very simple meso effects can create structure at one or both levels. We use an empirical example of a collaboration network about French cancer research elites and their affiliations (Lazega et al., 2006, 2008) to demonstrate that a full understanding of the network structure requires the cross-level parameters. We see these as the first steps in a full elaboration for general multilevel network analysis using ERGMs.

<snippet>The extant literature suggests that the formation of social networks within local communities may be linked to both positive (e.g., health, social well-being) and negative (e.g., social segregation or stratification) outcomes. In this study, we examine the social networks formed at the structural level by parents of community-based youth sport programs. Employing Quadratic Assignment Procedurest-test and Quadratic Assignment Procedures correlation, we empirically tested changes in recalled network density and homophily effects of parents (n= 391) at a community-level youth sport league located in the Southeastern USA. Our findings suggest that parents' social networks significantly increased in density from pre- to post-season. However, while we found no significant homophily effects based on socioeconomic characteristics, we did observe significant racial homophily effects for participants in basketball and baseball/softball.

<title>LOGISTIC NETWORK REGRESSION FOR SCALABLE ANALYSIS OF NETWORKS WITH JOINT EDGE/VERTEX DYNAMICS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0081175013520159</url>
<snippet>Change in group size and composition has long been an important area of research in the social sciences. Similarly, interest in interaction dynamics has a long history in sociology and social psychology. However, the effects of endogenous group change on interaction dynamics are a surprisingly understudied area. One way to explore these relationships is through social network models. Network dynamics may be viewed as a process of change in the edge structure of a network, in the vertex set on which edges are defined, or in both simultaneously. Although early studies of such processes were primarily descriptive, recent work on this topic has increasingly turned to formal statistical models. Although showing great promise, many of these modern dynamic models are computationally intensive and scale very poorly in the size of the network under study and/or the number of time points considered. Likewise, currently used models focus on edge dynamics, with little support for endogenously changing vertex sets. Here, the authors show how an existing approach based on logistic network regression can be extended to serve as a highly scalable framework for modeling large networks with dynamic vertex sets. The authors place this approach within a general dynamic exponential family (exponential-family random graph modeling) context, clarifying the assumptions underlying the framework (and providing a clear path for extensions), and they show how model assessment methods for cross-sectional networks can be extended to the dynamic case. Finally, the authors illustrate this approach on a classic data set involving interactions among windsurfers on a California beach.

<title>Overcoming Uncertainty in Novel Technologies: The Role of Venture Capital Syndication Networks in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Startup Investments in Korea and Japan</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems12030072</url>
<snippet>This paper investigates how historical inter-firm syndication networks influence venture capitalists' (VCs) propensity to invest in startups pursuing novel, uncertain technologies, with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI). We theorize that VCs' positional attributes within cumulative syndication networks determine their access to external expertise and intelligence that aid AI investment decisions amidst informational opacity. Specifically, reachability to prior AI investors provides referrals and insights transmitted across short network paths to reduce ambiguity. Additionally, VC brokerage between disconnected industry clusters furnishes expansive, non-redundant information that is pivotal for discovering and assessing AI opportunities. Through hypotheses grounded in social network theory, we posit network-based mechanisms that equip VCs to navigate uncertainty when engaging with ambiguous innovations like AI. We test our framework, utilizing comprehensive historical records of global venture capital investments. Analyzing the location information of VC firms in this database, we uncovered a history of 14,751 investments made by Korean and Japanese firms. Using these data, we assembled an imbalanced panel dataset from 1984 to 2022 spanning 230 Korean and 413 Japanese VCs, with 4508 firm-year observations. Negative binomial regression analysis of this dataset reveals how historical relational patterns among venture capital firms foster readiness to evaluate unfamiliar innovations.

<title>Self-Esteem Shapes the Impact of GPA and General Health on Facebook Addiction: A Mediation Analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439316656606</url>
<snippet>This study investigates the mediation impact of grade point average (GPA) and general health positive on Facebook addiction via self-esteem (SE) under the provision of active daily use of Facebook. We reached 120 participants who are college students. Our sample comprised 63 (52.5&#37;) females and 57 (47.5&#37;) males. We collected data through an online questionnaire. Structural equation modeling using IBM SPSS AMOS and mediation analysis were performed. The findings of the study suggested that SE is a critical and shaping construct when the decreasing impact of both GPA and general health positive on Facebook addiction is a concern. College students with low GPA and general health-positive feelings have low SE, which in turn increases the possibility of becoming a Facebook addict. Moreover, active daily use of Facebook is another factor triggering addiction. Recommendations and further research studies are presented.

<title>The effects of friendship networks on adolescent depressive symptoms</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2004.03.002</url>
<snippet>Previous studies have demonstrated that individuals who are socially integrated have better mental health, but these studies have been mostly limited to the adult population. Using data based on a nationally representative sample of adolescents (N = 11,023), 1 investigate whether those who are integrated into friendship networks have better mental health, as measured by number of depressive symptoms. The study also extends the literature by utilizing a variety of network measures of integration. The analyses showed that, consistent with previous findings in the adult studies, higher levels of integration were associated with fewer depressive symptoms, although the association was very weak. Number of friends, the simplest and most frequently used measure of integration in mental health research, had a stronger and more consistent effect than other variables which measured more complex aspects of egocentric and school-level network structure. The results also showed that the relationship between having more friends and fewer depressive symptoms was largely mediated by a sense of belonging, which provided support for the often assumed but rarely tested argument that social integration promotes mental health by inducing positive feelings about one's relationships with others in society.

<title>The Hotspots of Sports Science and the Effects of Knowledge Network on Scientific Performance Based on Bibliometrics and Social Network Analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/9981202</url>
<snippet>In this study, we sorted out the research hotspots in sports science by bibliometric method and also used social network analysis to explore the relationship between knowledge networks and their scientific performance. We found 38 high-frequency keywords with obvious curricular nature or classical direction of sports science research and 4 high-frequency research groups. The topics of hotspots covered the secondary disciplines of sports science: physical education and training, national traditional sports, sports human science, and sports humanities and sociology. However, sports human science research is less; therefore, accelerating the research of sports human science is the focus of future research. Meanwhile, we use social network structure analysis (i.e., centrality, clustering coefficient, PageRank, and structural holes) to study the relationship between knowledge elements in knowledge networks and their scientific performance. In addition to betweenness centrality, the closeness centrality, clustering coefficient, and structural holes of knowledge elements are significantly and positively related to their influence. In the relationship between knowledge elements and productivity, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality show significant positive correlations, and clustering coefficient and structural hole show significant negative correlations. Therefore, knowledge networks can be used to predict the scientific performance of knowledge elements.

<title>Digital Communication and Work-Life Supportive Supervisor Behaviors in Europe</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/si.v11i4.7084</url>
<snippet>The spread of digital communication in the employee-supervisor exchange relation has increased the risks of blurred boundaries between life domains and, subsequently, the need for work-life supportive supervisor behaviors (WLSSB). However, media richness and social presence theory indicate that WLSSB is simultaneously at risk because close bonds with supervisors are more difficult to develop and challenges in integrating work and personal life are more difficult to be signaled and understood. Following social network theory in the argument that it is not only the characteristic of the medium that is of importance but also the social embeddedness of its use, this research asks to what extent the association of digital communication with one's supervisor and perceived WLSSB is context-dependent. The overall results based on the European Social Survey (round 10) reveal that in-person communication is more strongly associated with WLSSB than digital communication. However, more nuanced investigations suggest that this is not necessarily driven by the richness of the mode of communication. We find that the meaning of digital communication with one's supervisor gains importance in size and significance (a) where it complements seldom in-person communication, (b) where the organizational norm of high work devotion is weak, and

<title>Adoption and adaptation: A computational case study of the spread of Granovetter's weak ties hypothesis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.01.001</url>
<snippet>How do new scientific ideas diffuse? Computational studies reveal how network structures facilitate or obstruct diffusion; qualitative studies demonstrate that diffusion entails the continuous translation and transformation of ideas. This article bridges these computational and qualitative approaches to study diffusion as a complex process of continuous adaptation. As a case study, we analyze the spread of Granovetter's Strength of Weak Ties hypothesis, published in American Journal of Sociology in 1973. Through network analysis, topic modeling and a close reading of a diffusion network created using Web of Science data, we study how different communities in this network interpret and develop Granovetter's hypothesis in distinct ways. We further trace how these communities originate, merge and split, and examine how central scholars emerge as community leaders or brokers in the diffusion process.

<title>Getting along to get ahead: The role of social context in tournament promotion and reward systems</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257389</url>
<snippet>Tournament theory posits that some organizations are modeled after sports tournaments whereby individuals are incentivized to compete and win against other members of the organization. A persistent criticism of tournament theory is that rank-order success of employees is entirely dependent on non-interacting or at least non-cooperating entities. To address what part, if any, cooperation plays in competitive tournaments, this study examines the role of social networks in tournament-style promotion and reward systems. Specifically, we seek to identify the importance of social relationships, such as group dissimilarity, initial tie formation, and tie strength in predicting tournament success. Bringing two largely independent research streams together (one focused on cooperation and one framed around competition), we examine how individuals' performance interacts with their social relationships-their social networks-to influence their chances of winning a tournament. Using the Survivor television series, we analyze the behaviors of 535 interacting contestants across 30 tournaments. In general, the findings help to illustrate how performance and social networks predict tournament advancement. Interestingly, we find that group dissimilarity based on gender, race, and age, largely does not play a role in advancement in the tournaments. Further, the strength of ties fails to mediate between variables such as group dissimilarity and initial tie formation. We conclude by discussing future directions for theoretical and practical exploration of tournament-style promotion systems. Recommendations include continuing to explore and test the role of social dynamics in compensation and promotion systems.

<title>Optimizing targeted vaccination across cyber-physical networks: an empirically based mathematical simulation study</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2017.0783</url>
<snippet>Targeted vaccination, whether to minimize the forward transmission of infectious diseases or their clinical impact, is one of the 'holy grails' of modern infectious disease outbreak response, yet it is difficult to achieve in practice due to the challenge of identifying optimal targets in real time. If interruption of disease transmission is the goal, targeting requires knowledge of underlying person-to-person contact networks. Digital communication networks may reflect not only virtual but also physical interactions that could result in disease transmission, but the precise overlap between these cyber and physical networks has never been empirically explored in real-life settings. Here, we study the digital communication activity of more than 500 individuals along with their person-to-person contacts at a 5-min temporal resolution. We then simulate different disease transmission scenarios on the person-to-person physical contact network to determine whether cyber communication networks can be harnessed to advance the goal of targeted vaccination for a disease spreading on the network of physical proximity. We show that individuals selected on the basis of their closeness centrality within cyber networks (what we call 'cyber-directed vaccination') can enhance vaccination campaigns against diseases with short-range (but not full-range) modes of transmission.

<title>Cognitive modeling of socially transmitted affordances: a computational model of behavioral adoption tested against archival data from the Stanford Prison Experiment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-013-9162-1</url>
<snippet>Social learning and adoption of new affordances govern the rise of new a variety of behaviors, from actions as mundane as dance steps to those as dangerous as new ways to make improvised explosive device (IED) detonators. Traditional diffusion models and social network structures fail to adequately explain who would be likely to imitate new behavior and why some agents adopt the behavior while others do not. To address this gap, a cognitive model was designed that represents well-known socio-cognitive factors of attention, social influence, and motivation that influence learning and adoption of new behavior. This model was implemented in the Performance Moderator Function Server (PMFServ) agent-based cognitive architecture, enabling the creation of simulations where affordances spread memetically through cognitive mechanisms. This approach models facets of behavioral adoption that have not been explored by existing architectures: unintentional learning, multi-layered social and environmental attention cues, and contextual adoption. To examine the effectiveness of this model, its performance was tested against data from the Stanford Prison Experiment collected from the Archives of the History of American Psychology.

<title>Financial and digital financial literacy through social media use towards financial inclusion among batik small enterprises in Indonesia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34902</url>
<snippet>Batik, an Indonesian textile art form, holds immense economic and cultural importance. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) specialising in batik play a crucial role in Indonesia's economic growth and cultural preservation, contributing significantly to the gross domestic product (GDP) and preserving the nation's heritage. Nevertheless, these enterprises face several challenges, such as slow growth and limited access to credit. The batik industry also lags in financial literacy and the adoption of digital marketing strategies, hindering its development. This quantitative study aims to investigate the relationship between financial literacy, digital financial literacy, and financial inclusion in batik SMEs and also examined the moderating effect of online social networks. A survey was conducted involving 535 managers, owners, and financial officers of small batik enterprises. Subsequently, the SmartPLS statistical analysis method was employed for data analysis. The results demonstrate that financial literacy and digital financial literacy play a significant role in accessing financial inclusion for batik small enterprises. Moreover, the utilisation of social media was found to moderate these relationships, amplifying the impact of financial and digital literacy on financial inclusion. The findings contribute to the existing knowledge, provide insights for enhancing batik small enterprises, and propose a digital financial model to promote financial inclusion.

<title>Lay theories of networking ability: Beliefs that inhibit instrumental networking</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2020.01.003</url>
<snippet>While touting the importance of building effective networks, scholars have paid far less attention to why so many people feel so ambivalent or conflicted about instrumental networking, and what can be done to change such attitudes. The present research provides the first empirical test of a novel theory, which argues that people are more likely to disengage from networking if they hold a "fixed theory" of networking ability-believing that how well one networks is fixed or innate rather than learned through effort-which triggers negative attitudes toward moral and instrumental aspects of networking. To test this argument, we first develop and validate a Lay Theory of Networking Ability scale (Study 1) and show that this scale predicts people's attendance in networking events over a 6-week period (Study 2). Next, we show that lay theories can be experimentally manipulated, with consequences for attendance in networking events over a 4-week period (Study 3) as well as people's affective experiences in networking events (Study 4). In all, the present research contributes to our understanding of the motivational psychology of networking by highlighting the importance of beliefs as an understudied construct in the networks literature and by introducing methods to measure and manipulate them.

<snippet>In this paper we investigate shifts in Twitter network topology resulting from the type of information being shared. We identified communities matching areas of agricultural expertise and measured the core-periphery centralization of network formations resulting from users sharing generic versus specialized information. We found that centralization increases when specialized information is shared and that the network adopts decentralized formations as conversations become more generic. The results are consistent with classical diffusion models positing that specialized information comes with greater centralization, but they also show that users favor decentralized formations, which can foster community cohesion, when spreading specialized information is secondary.

<title>Digital inequalities and why they matter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1012532</url>
<snippet>While the field of digital inequality continues to expand in many directions, the relationship between digital inequalities and other forms of inequality has yet to be fully appreciated. This article invites social scientists in and outside the field of digital media studies to attend to digital inequality, both as a substantive problem and as a methodological concern. The authors present current research on multiple aspects of digital inequality, defined expansively in terms of access, usage, skills, and self-perceptions, as well as future lines of research. Each of the contributions makes the case that digital inequality deserves a place alongside more traditional forms of inequality in the twenty-first century pantheon of inequalities. Digital inequality should not be only the preserve of specialists but should make its way into the work of social scientists concerned with a broad range of outcomes connected to life chances and life trajectories. As we argue, the significance of digital inequalities is clear across a broad range of individual-level and macro-level domains, including life course, gender, race, and class, as well as health care, politics, economic activity, and social capital.

<title>Knowledge through social networks: Accuracy, error, and polarisation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0294815</url>
<snippet>This paper examines the fundamental problem of testimony. Much of what we believe to know we know in good part, or even entirely, through the testimony of others. The problem with testimony is that we often have very little on which to base estimates of the accuracy of our sources. Simulations with otherwise optimal agents examine the impact of this for the accuracy of our beliefs about the world. It is demonstrated both where social networks of information dissemination help and where they hinder. Most importantly, it is shown that both social networks and a common strategy for gauging the accuracy of our sources give rise to polarisation even for entirely accuracy motivated agents. Crucially these two factors interact, amplifying one another's negative consequences, and this side effect of communication in a social network increases with network size. This suggests a new causal mechanism by which social media may have fostered the increase in polarisation currently observed in many parts of the world.

<snippet>This study examines the effects of social network structure of intermediaries in health care, namely referring physicians, upon the specialty treatment choices of patients in the United States. The social network of a referring physician is identified by the patient-sharing pattern in Medicare claims data, and the following three measures are employed as key explanatory variables: (1) number of physicians connected (adjusted degree); (2) tightness of the network (clustering coefficient); and (3) influence of individual physicians in the network (eigenvector centrality). The results of discrete-choice demand models suggest that if patients are referred by a physician who is a more important player in their social networks (i.e. eigenvector centrality is higher), the patient has a higher chance of choosing a surgeon of better quality.

<title>Coalition-Committees as Network Interventions: Baseline Network Composition in Context of Childhood Obesity Prevention Interventions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems9030066</url>
<snippet>Community coalitions can address local issues with deep, historic, and contextual understanding that enables customized implementation of evidence-based strategies. The individuals within the coalition, their partnerships, and the social context is likely an important component of unraveling the challenges of implementation so interventions reach people in need. We focus on the relevance of baseline coalition-committee network (CCN), the networks of purposely formed subcommittees within community coalitions, structure as one of the moderating, theoretical links between community coalition social networks and intervention success. We explore the baseline composition and characteristics of five CCNs at the beginning of childhood obesity prevention interventions. Using a combination of social network, multidimensional scaling, and correspondence analyses, we examine the structure and heterogeneity of five CCNs, each consisting of a core group of stakeholders in the coalition and sometimes the broader community itself. Cross-sectional analyses are used to examine the composition of coalition-committees related to network density, centralization, hierarchy, and coalition demographics and characteristics. Results indicate that CCNs are patterned in their structure and characteristics, and we discuss whether adjustments to childhood obesity prevention interventions according to baseline structure and characteristics could be advantageous for intervention implementation. Together, these findings can inform future longitudinal investigations into CCN network structure.

<title>Does Qualitative Network Analysis Exist?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Social network analysis was formed and established in the 1970s as a way of analyzing systems of social relations. In this review the theoretical-methodological standpoint of social network analysis ("structural analysis") is introduced and the different forms of social network analysis are presented. Structural analysis argues that social actors and social relations are embedded in social networks, meaning that action and perception of actors as well as the performance of social relations are influenced by the network structure. Since the 1990s structural analysis has integrated concepts such as agency, discourse and symbolic orientation and in this way structural analysis has opened itself. Since then there has been increasing use of qualitative methods in network analysis. They are used to include the perspective of the analyzed actors, to explore networks, and to understand network dynamics. In the reviewed book, edited by Betina HOLLSTEIN and Florian STRAUS, the twenty predominantly empirically orientated contributions demonstrate the possibilities of combining quantitative and qualitative methods in network analyses in different research fields. In this review we examine how the contributions succeed in applying and developing the structural analysis perspective, and the self-positioning of "qualitative network analysis" is evaluated.

<title>Research disciplinary interactions on scientific collaboration network in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution: Characteristics and dynamics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266404</url>
<snippet>Interdisciplinary scientific collaboration promotes the innovative development of scientific research. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) is a typical interdisciplinary subject. This study aims to explore the characteristics of discipline interaction and the temporal evolution in the field. Bibliometric analysis could be used to understand the stage of research in a particular subject. In this work, the publications on the topic in Web of Science (WoS) platform from 1999 to 2020 were selected. On the basis of social network theory, the characteristics of interdisciplinary were revealed from three perspectives. First, the disciplinary interaction network is constructed through disciplinary co-occurrence to detect the characteristics of interaction structure among different disciplines. Then the node centrality index is employed to explore the influence of disciplines in the interactive network by using network centrality analysis. Moreover, the dynamic of discipline interaction evolution is studied using blockmodeling analysis. In the field of PHE, the number of disciplines and the intensity of interaction among different subjects gradually increased in the past 20 years. Chemistry and Material Sciences are the core discipline, and they play an important role in the network. The whole network is divided into different discipline groups. The scale of the discipline group is becoming large, and the disciplinary interaction is becoming more complex. The obtained results are helpful for guiding scholars to carry out interdisciplinary interaction. The methods of detecting interdisciplinary interactive relationship could provide paths for interdisciplinary research in other fields.

<title>Counting on kin:: Social networks, social support, and child health status</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/sof.2005.0036</url>
<snippet>This article presents the results Of new data collection in Mexico about the relationship between child well-being and social networks. Two research questions guide the analysis. First, under what conditions do networks generate greater (lesser) support? Second, what kinds of networks are associated with healthier children? We explore the health status effects of several dimensions of social networks, including network size, kinship roles, interaction (proximity, contact, and coresidence), and provision of financial and emotional support. Our key findings suggest that networks containing more extended kin and coresident ties offer greater support resources to mothers with young children, especially among the poorest households. We also find that network structures characterized by more social support and greater interaction with extended, rather than immediate, kin help sustain healthier children. Together these findings indicate the advantages of examining specific role relationships in network research among economically marginalized families and attest to the importance of social networks founded on principles of reciprocity, confianza, and compadrazgo to the well-being of Mexican families.

This article presents analyses of a whole-network survey of investigators participating in a new research initiative, and examines the development of collaborative ties over the network's first year. In particular, we examine the influence of research center affiliation, seniority, and prior network experience on the number and structure of collaborative ties, including participants' bridging and broker roles. Such analyses can inform the overall management of the project in purposefully promoting new collaboration opportunities, and may ultimately predict the number of collaborative products generated by the network members.

<title>White matter connectivity in brain networks supporting social and affective processing predicts real-world social network characteristics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03655-8</url>
<snippet>Human behavior is embedded in social networks. Certain characteristics of the positions that people occupy within these networks appear to be stable within individuals. Such traits likely stem in part from individual differences in how people tend to think and behave, which may be driven by individual differences in the neuroanatomy supporting socio-affective processing. To investigate this possibility, we reconstructed the full social networks of three graduate student cohorts (N = 275; N = 279; N = 285), a subset of whom (N = 112) underwent diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Although no single tract in isolation appears to be necessary or sufficient to predict social network characteristics, distributed patterns of white matter microstructural integrity in brain networks supporting social and affective processing predict eigenvector centrality (how well-connected someone is to well-connected others) and brokerage (how much one connects otherwise unconnected others). Thus, where individuals sit in their real-world social networks is reflected in their structural brain networks. More broadly, these results suggest that the application of data-driven methods to neuroimaging data can be a promising approach to investigate how brains shape and are shaped by individuals' positions in their real-world social networks. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging reveals that students' standing in their real-world social networks is reflected in patterns of brain network connectivity.

<title>Using Ego Network Data to Inform Agent-based Models of Diffusion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0049124118769100</url>
<snippet>Agent-based modeling holds great potential as an analytical tool. Agent-based models (ABMs) are, however, also vulnerable to critique, as they often employ stylized social worlds, with little connection to the actual environment in question. Given these concerns, there has been a recent call to more fully incorporate empirical data into ABMs. This article falls in this tradition, exploring the benefits of using sampled ego network data in ABMs of cultural diffusion. Thus, instead of relying on full network data, which can be difficult and costly to collect, or no empirical network data, which is convenient but not empirically grounded, we offer a middle-ground, one combining ABMs with recent work on network sampling. The main question is whether this approach is effective. We provide a test of the approach using six complete networks; the test also includes a range of diffusion models (where actors follow different rules of adoption). For each network, we take a random ego network sample and use that sample to infer the full network structure. We then run a diffusion model through the known, complete networks, as well as the inferred networks, and compare the results. The results, on the whole, are quite strong: Across all analyses, the diffusion curves based on the sampled data are very similar to the curves based on the true, complete network. This suggests that ego network sampling can, in fact, offer a practical means of incorporating empirical data into an agent-based model.

<title>The rich get richer: Extroverts' social capital on twitter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101551</url>
<snippet>Previous studies have associated social capital to one's social networks. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have looked at the interplay between one's personality, twitter activity, and number of twitter followers; with his or her social capital. Therefore, this research paper examined a correlation between these dimensions, to see if potentially people with different personalities have different benefits from their Twitter based activity. Social capital was measured by a survey (N = 218), and number of Twitter followings was analyzed based on the social ties of participants on Twitter (these data were collected using a script developed for this purpose). Our findings indicate that there is a correlation between the frequency of Twitter use, extroversion and perceived online bridging social capital of users. In other words, extroverts gain more online social capital through their online followings (when compared to their introvert counterparts); when introverts and extroverts have the same network size, extroverts gain more social capital. Furthermore, when introverts and extroverts have the same network size and also use Twitter more frequently, extroverts gain more social capital. The use of online social networking sites is significant in terms of social capital benefits. Furthermore, our results support the 'Rich get Richer' model by showing that people who are social offline benefit from their sociability also online.

<title>The Company You Keep: How Network Disciplinary Diversity Enhances the Productivity of Researchers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642221127242</url>
<snippet>The Covid-19 pandemic has affected most organizations' working environment and productivity. Organizations have had to make arrangements for staff to operate remotely following the implementation of lockdown regulations around the world, as the pandemic has led to restrictions on movement and the temporary closure of workplace premises. The purpose of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of the effect of this transition on productivity during the pandemic, by studying a distributed network of research who collaborate remotely. We examine how the productivity of researchers is affected by the distributed collaborative networks in which they are embedded. Our goal is to understand the effects of brokerage and closure on the researchers' publication rate, which is interpreted as an indicator of their productivity. We analyze researchers' communication networks, focusing on structural holes and diversity. We take into account the individual qualities of the focal researcher such as seniority. We find that disciplinary diversity among researchers' peers increases the researchers' productivity, lending support to the brokerage argument. In addition, we find support for two statistical interaction effects. First, structural holes moderate diversity so that researchers with diverse networks are more productive when their networks also have a less redundant structure. Diversity and structural holes, when combined, further researchers' productivity. Second, seniority moderates diversity such that senior researchers are more productive than junior researchers in less diverse networks. In more diverse networks, junior researchers perform as well as senior researchers. Social capital and human capital are complementary. We conclude that the benefits of diversity on researchers' productivity are contingent on the qualities of the researchers and on network structure. The brokerage/closure debate thus needs a more nuanced understanding of causal relationships.

<title>The Sociology of Creativity: Elements, Structures, and Audiences</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-121919-054833</url>
<snippet>This review integrates diverse characterizations of creativity from a sociological perspective with the goal of reinvigorating discussion of the sociology of creativity. We start by exploring relevant works of classical social theory to uncover key assumptions and principles, which are used as a theoretical basis for our proposed definition of creativity: an intentional configuration of cultural and material elements that is unexpected for a given audience. Our argument is enriched by locating creativity vis-a-vis related concepts-such as originality, knowledge, innovation, atypicality, and consecration-and across neighboring disciplines. Underlying the discussion are antecedents (structure, institutions, and context) and consequences (audiences, perception, and evaluation), which are treated separately. We end our review by speculating on ways in which sociologists can take the discussion of creativity forward.

<title>Diffusion of innovations through social networks: Determinants and implications</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/soc4.13084</url>
<snippet>Social scientists have long been interested in the diffusion of innovations-the process by which new ideas, behavior, and practices spread between persons, organizations, and even countries. While innovations can enter a community through various channels, ongoing spread of innovations through a community occurs through the medium of social networks-collections of interpersonal or digital relationships connecting actors to each other. Social networks are important for diffusion because relationships foster communication, trust, and flow of information. Diffusion outcomes are also shaped by the structural properties of social networks such as density, centrality, and strength of ties, as well as properties of the innovation and the actors involved in the process. The purpose of the article is twofold: (1) to take stock of the field and review ongoing debates on the role of social networks in the diffusion of innovations and (2) to summarize the sociological implications of the diffusion of innovations through social networks.

<title>Social Networks and Supply Chain Management in Fish Trade</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2158244020931815</url>
<snippet>This study aims to construct a theoretical framework to analyze the elements of the network structure and the relationship system within the seafood supply chain. The scope of the investigation is to evaluate how these elements influence the flow of products and the efficiency of the seafood supply chain and why these social interactions can create value and enhance competitive advantage. The model combines the resource- and knowledge-based view and the social network analysis applied to seafood supply chains. To demonstrate the application of the model, two theoretical examples and a real case study of the Mercado del Mar in Guadalajara, Mexico, are used. Primary data are obtained from semi-structured interviews, social network analysis metrics, and qualitative analysis. Findings are based on the analysis of theoretical examples and must be considered with caution. Nevertheless, the observations in the examples and case study provide new arguments to the relationship between the pattern of interrelationship and the efficiency of a supply chain. This study emphasizes the necessity of combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to understand and explain real-life supply networks.

<title>Social networks and ambidextrous innovation in SMEs: the mediating role of dynamic capabilities and the moderating role of technological turbulence</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2022.2157710</url>
<snippet>This study examines the role of social networks on SMEs (Small- and medium-sized enterprises)' ambidextrous innovation and discusses the mediating effect of dynamic capabilities and the moderating effect of technological turbulence from the perspectives of social network theory and dynamic capability theory. Empirical data were garnered from a sample of 494 SMEs in China and structural equation modelling was used to test the proposed relationships. The results show that: (1) both dimensions of the social networks (relational and structural networks) have a positive impact on SMEs' exploratory innovation(ERI) and exploitative innovation(EII) - the relational networks(RNs) have a stronger impact on SMEs' EII while the structural networks(SNs) have a stronger impact on SMEs' ERI; (2) dynamic capabilities play a mediating role between RNs, SNs and SMEs' ERI, EII; (3) technological turbulence positively moderates the dynamic capabilities - ERI relationship, while not moderates the dynamic capabilities - EII relationship; (4) the indirect effects of RNs and SNs on ERI via dynamic capabilities is moderated by technological turbulence, while the indirect effects of RNs and SNs on EII via dynamic capabilities is not moderated by technological turbulence.

<title>Parsing Social Network Survey Data from Hidden Populations Using Stochastic Context-Free Grammars</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006777</url>
<snippet>Background: Human populations are structured by social networks, in which individuals tend to form relationships based on shared attributes. Certain attributes that are ambiguous, stigmatized or illegal can create a OhiddenO population, so-called because its members are difficult to identify. Many hidden populations are also at an elevated risk of exposure to infectious diseases. Consequently, public health agencies are presently adopting modern survey techniques that traverse social networks in hidden populations by soliciting individuals to recruit their peers, e. g., respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The concomitant accumulation of network-based epidemiological data, however, is rapidly outpacing the development of computational methods for analysis. Moreover, current analytical models rely on unrealistic assumptions, e. g., that the traversal of social networks can be modeled by a Markov chain rather than a branching process. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we develop a new methodology based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), which are well-suited to modeling tree-like structure of the RDS recruitment process. We apply this methodology to an RDS case study of injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana, Mexico, a hidden population at high risk of blood-borne and sexually-transmitted infections (i.e., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syphilis). Survey data were encoded as text strings that were parsed using our custom implementation of the inside-outside algorithm in a publicly-available software package (HyPhy), which uses either expectation maximization or direct optimization methods and permits constraints on model parameters for hypothesis testing. We identified significant latent variability in the recruitment process that violates assumptions of Markov chain-based methods for RDS analysis: firstly, IDUs tended to emulate the recruitment behavior of their own recruiter; and secondly, the recruitment of like peers (homophily) was dependent on the number of recruits. Conclusions: SCFGs provide a rich probabilistic language that can articulate complex latent structure in survey data derived from the traversal of social networks. Such structure that has no representation in Markov chain-based models can interfere with the estimation of the composition of hidden populations if left unaccounted for, raising critical implications for the prevention and control of infectious disease epidemics.

<title>CONCEPTUALIZING NETWORKS AS ASSEMBLAGES A case study from the Spanish ceramics sector</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/ris.2009.06.29</url>
<snippet>Network structures are being used to explain social interactions within and between organisations in many ways that have become very influential. Many of the sociological features of organisations are captured very effectively by network descriptions, but such descriptions also retain serious limitations. Some network theories, for example, are composed of fragmented and internally inconsistent theories, while others depend upon essentialist and reductionist models. Perhaps a more serious problem is that networks describe relationships rather than explain the mechanisms through which these relationships function. This paper introduces the notion of assemblages as a corrective to these problems. The concept offers a clear, though suitably complex, framework with which to clarify the dynamics and structures that afford engagement and enable collective action among diverse elements of organisations. Using brief examples from recent research in the innovation literature, supported by an empirical case study in the Spanish ceramics sector, this paper will illustrate how reconceptualising network relationships in terms of their assemblages enables a more robust and consistent theoretical grounding for network research.

<title>Influence of Social Network Strength on Entrepreneurial Opportunity Recognition: A Chain Mediation Model of Need Knowledge and Technological Knowledge</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/3817644</url>
<snippet>Entrepreneurial opportunity recognition is a key focus of entrepreneurship research and has received considerable attention in recent years. Previous research has highlighted that social network strength, need knowledge, and technological knowledge are important factors in entrepreneurial opportunity recognition and that these factors in isolation cannot sufficiently explain how entrepreneurial opportunities are recognized. Nonetheless, little is known about the effect that social network strength may exert on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition through need knowledge and technological knowledge. Building on social network theory, this study develops and examines a chain mediation model that incorporates need knowledge and technological knowledge into the relationship between social network strength and entrepreneurial opportunity recognition. The results of this study demonstrate that the effect of social network strength on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition can be partitioned into the direct and indirect effects. In particular, the effect of social network strength on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition is mediated by need knowledge, not by technological knowledge. Moreover, need knowledge and technological knowledge play a continuous mediating role in the relationship between social network strength and entrepreneurial opportunity recognition. These findings extend the entrepreneurial opportunity recognition literature by casting light on the knowledge conduits linking social network strength to entrepreneurial opportunity recognition.

<title>Research on the evolution of spatial network structure of tourism eco-efficiency and its influencing factors in China's provinces based on carbon emission accounting</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272667</url>
<snippet>In the context of global warming, although the coordinated development of tourism has led to regional economic growth, the high energy consumption-driven effects of such development have also led to environmental degradation. This research combines the undesired output of the Super-SBM model and social network analysis methods to determine the ecoefficiency of provincial tourism in China from 2010-2019 and analyzes its spatial correlation characteristics as well as its influencing factors. The aim of the project is to improve China's regional tourism eco-efficiency and promote cross-regional tourism correlation. The results show that (1) the mean value of provincial tourism eco-efficiency in China is maintained at 0.405 similar to 0.612, with an overall fluctuating upward trend. The tourism eco-efficiency of eastern China is higher than that of central, western and northeastern China, but the latter three regions have not formed a stable spatial distribution pattern. (2) The spatial network of provincial tourism eco-efficiency in China is multithreaded, dense and diversified. Throughout the network, affiliations are becoming closer, and network structure robustness is gradually improving, although the "hierarchical" spatial network structure remains. In individual networks, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Shandong provinces in eastern China have higher centrality degrees, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality than other provinces, which means they are dominant in the network. Hainan Province, also located in eastern China, has not yet built a "bridge" for tourism factor circulation. In the core-periphery model, the core-periphery areas of China's provincial tourism eco-efficiency are distributed in clusters, and the number of "core members" has increased. (3) The economic development level, information technology development level, and tourism technology level collectively drive the development and evolution of China's provincial tourism eco-efficiency spatial network.

<title>Friends in locked places: An investigation of prison inmate network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2016.12.006</url>
<snippet>The current study investigates informal social structure among prison inmates. Data come from the Prison Inmate Network Study (PINS), a project focused on a unit of a Pennsylvania medium security men's prison. We focus on 205 inmates and their "get along with" network - an approximation of friendship in other settings. We find a weak subgroup structure dominated by two groups of "old heads" and characterized by moderate (non gang-based) race/ethnic clustering. Structurally, the network resembles adolescents in schools, suggesting that prison inmates are capable, of successfully building peer associations. We conclude that under the right conditions self-organizing inmate society can foster social integration reminiscent of other social settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Sociometric network structure and its association with methamphetamine use norms among homeless youth</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.01.004</url>
<snippet>Homeless youths' social networks are consistently linked with their substance use. Social networks influence behavior through several mechanisms, especially social norms. This study used sociometric analyses to understand whether social norms of drug use behaviors are clustered in network structures and whether these perceived norms (descriptive and injunctive) influence youths' drug use behaviors. An event-based approach was used to delineate boundaries of the two sociometric networks of homeless youth, one in Los Angeles, CA (n = 160) and the other in Santa Monica, CA (n = 130). Network characteristics included centrality (i.e., popularity) and cohesiveness (location in dense subnetworks). The primary outcome was recent methamphetamine use. Results revealed that both descriptive and injunctive norms influenced methamphetamine use. Network cohesion was found to be associated with perception of both descriptive and injunctive norms in both networks, however in opposite directions. Network interventions therefore might be effective if designed to capitalize on social influence that naturally occurs in cohesive parts of networks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<title>Social Media and Protest Participation: Evidence From Russia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA14281</url>
<snippet>Do new communication technologies, such as social media, alleviate the collective action problem? This paper provides evidence that penetration of VK, the dominant Russian online social network, led to more protest activity during a wave of protests in Russia in 2011. As a source of exogenous variation in network penetration, we use the information on the city of origin of the students who studied with the founder of VK, controlling for the city of origin of the students who studied at the same university several years earlier or later. We find that a 10&#37; increase in VK penetration increased the probability of a protest by 4.6&#37; and the number of protesters by 19&#37;. Additional results suggest that social media induced protest activity by reducing the costs of coordination rather than by spreading information critical of the government. We observe that VK penetration increased pro-governmental support, with no evidence of increased polarization. We also find that cities with higher fractionalization of network users between VK and Facebook experienced fewer protests, and the effect of VK on protests exhibits threshold behavior.

<title>Diversity in action: Interpersonal networks and the distribution of advice</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2012.08.013</url>
<snippet>Does diversity beget the active dissemination of social support in the form of advice to others? Previous research by Robert Putnam suggests that individuals in compositionally diverse geographical areas become closed off from their social ties and less trusting of others, which are both antithetical to social support exchange. We argue, however, that studies of compositional diversity are ill-suited to reflect diversity as it is actually lived and experienced in social life. Drawing from the first nationally representative study with comprehensive indicators of interactional diversity in social life, we analyze self-reports of advice-giving across a variety of social roles. Results of regression analysis are consistent: greater interactional diversity is positively associated with advice-giving, whether the target is stranger, neighbor, close friend, or family member. These findings hold independent of important covariates such as reciprocity, sociability, and homophily. This research contributes to a growing literature set on identifying the unanticipated benefits of diversity in modern society. In sum, we call future research to consider not only diversity in structure, but also diversity in action. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<title>Product development team formation: effects of organizational- and product-related factors</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-019-09302-8</url>
<snippet>Although the performance of new product development (PD) is dependent on the structure and formation of design teams, effective configuration of the PD teams remains largely unexplored. According to social network research, teams are often organized in either closely connected or sparse structure. We conceptualize PD projects as collective problem-solving endeavors and develop a computational model of these projects where a number of designers conduct search over an NK(C) performance landscape. We group the designers in teams with closely connected or sparse structure. We also consider various organizational integration capabilities (i.e., coordinated operations, and common principles) as well as interaction networks among the teams (i.e., acyclical, cyclical, and modular). We use simulation and compare the design performance of teams with different configurations. Our results indicate that the extent by which organizations can effectively integrate design solutions determines the team structure and is likely to result in higher development performance. In addition, the design performance of strategies that employ both closely connected and sparse teams is contrasted with the strategies that use either of these structures. Regardless of the integration capabilities of the PD projects, strategies that simultaneously utilize both closely connected and sparse teams are likely to achieve higher development performance than strategies that only use teams with one particular structure.

<title>The development of stratification and segregation in a new scientific field: A study of collaboration among scientists in neuroblastoma research between 1975 and 2016</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.05.001</url>
<snippet>Using a new data set on scientific collaboration in neuroblastoma research over a period of 41 years, we study how the structure of collaboration ties in an evolving scientific field changes over time. Guided by concepts from the sociology of knowledge and status theories, we highlight the importance of a field's size and age for processes of stratification and segregation within it. Our findings suggest that stratification becomes stronger and di-versifies as the field of neuroblastoma research expands. Moreover, we find that the occurrence of collaboration between researchers with a similar status becomes more likely as the field matures. While previous work has primarily examined established fields, our study focuses on how scientific fields change their structure over time. More broadly, our article demonstrates the potential analytical merits of adopting a dynamic and relational perspective on the developmental trajectories of organizational and cultural fields.

<title>Vaccination homophily in ego contact networks during the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-65986-2</url>
<snippet>Vaccine hesitancy is an inevitable risk for societies as it contributes to outbreaks of diseases. Prior research suggests that vaccination decisions of individuals tend to spread within social networks, resulting in a tendency to vaccination homophily. The clustering of individuals resistant to vaccination can substantially make the threshold necessary to achieve herd immunity harder to reach. In this study, we examined the extent of vaccination homophily among social contacts and its association with vaccine uptake during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary using a contact diary approach in two cross-sectional surveys. The results indicate strong clustering among both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. The most powerful predictor of vaccine uptake was the perceived vaccination rate within the egos' social contact network. Vaccination homophily and the role of the interpersonal contact network in vaccine uptake were particularly pronounced in the networks of close relationships, including family, kinship, and strong social ties of the ego. Our findings have important implications for understanding COVID-19 spread dynamics by showing that the strong clustering of unvaccinated individuals posed a great risk in preventing the spread of the disease.

<snippet>This paper compares a firm's innovation and performance with its online Web presence measured through the Web network structure. 489 firms in five different industries listed on the United States and Chinese stock markets are investigated. Using Web link data collected from Bing, blogs, Twitter and Wikipedia, we find positive correlation between betweenness centrality of a firm in the Web network and its innovation capability; and between betweenness centrality and financial performance. In order to get more accurate forecasting results, regression analysis is done for each industry and the combined industries in the United States and China. We also find that Twitter and Wikipedia only predict a firm's performance in the United States, which is not surprising as they are officially blocked in China. Blogs predict better in China than they do in the United States, as it might still be a major social media tool for Chinese firms; while for the US firms, blogs have been supplemented by Twitter and Wikipedia.

<title>Neighborhood co-offending networks, structural embeddedness, and violent crime in Chicago</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2016.12.003</url>
<snippet>Neighborhood disparities in crime are a persistent feature of U.S. cities. Scholars have documented that both local structural conditions and characteristics of spatially proximate communities influence neigh-borhood crime rates. Previous studies on neighborhood inequality in crime, however, are limited by their focus on identifying average spillover effects between pairs of spatially contiguous neighborhoods, and have neglected to consider how the broader social organization of the city influences local outcomes. This study examines the role of neighborhood-level criminal networks in shaping the distribution of crime throughout cities. Employing arrest records and survey data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, we construct a neighborhood-level co-offending network for Chicago for 2001. We use this network to investigate how a focal neighborhood's homicide rate is influenced by its structural embeddedness within the larger inter -neighborhood co-offending network. Results indicate that a neighborhood's embeddedness increases the local homicide rate, even after controlling for the neighborhood's internal propensity toward crime and accounting for unobserved spatial processes.

<title>WHEN EXPERIENCE COUNTS - THE EFFECTS OF EXPERIENTIAL AND STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY ON PATTERNS OF SUPPORT AND INTERPERSONAL STRESS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2580459</url>
<snippet>Previous research has suggested that individuals benefit from having associates who are similar to themselves on a variety of dimensions. This article develops a theoretical basis for predicting which types of similarity are most important in determining whether associates will be sources of social support or interpersonal stress. Drawing upon theories of homophily and reference groups, we suggest that experiential similarity (e.g., having experienced a similar status transition) is more important than structural similarity (e.g., similarity of age, gender, marital status) in determining sources of emotional support and stress following life events. The theoretical arguments are supported by data from two separate longitudinal studies of social networks following status transitions; specifically, returning to school and becoming the primary caregiver to an elderly parent.

<title>How tie strength in alliance network affects the emergence of dominant design: the mediating effects of exploration and exploitation innovation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2021.1890012</url>
<snippet>Drawing on social network theory and technological innovation literature, this study investigates how firm innovation mediates the relationship between tie strength of alliance network and the probability of producing dominant designs. We argue that strong ties facilitate both exploratory and exploitative innovation, which enables firms to produce dominant designs. We test the hypotheses with data from the Chinese automotive industry during 2004 and 2012. The findings suggest that strong network ties help producing dominant designs through facilitating exploitative but not exploratory innovation. This study reveals how the social networks, as important resources, influence firm performance in the competition to produce a dominant design. Firms must engage in innovation activities, especially exploitative innovation activities, to realise the value of their networks.

<snippet>This study aims to examine the relationship between online volunteering and subjective well-being (SWB) and to explore the mediation effect of online bridging networks. The data used in this study came from the 2019 Chinese General Social Survey (CSS). In this study, individuals who responded to survey questions about their participation in online volunteering activities and their subjective well-being(SWB) were included for analysis (N = 5556). The results showed a positive relationship between online volunteering and online bridging networks and indicated that online volunteering affects subjective well-being through the mediating role of online bridging networks. The implications of this study are relevant to policy-makers in public health and social service organizations. Based on the findings, policy-makers and nonprofit organizations are called on to support this type of volunteering which is an important means of improving public health. Nonprofit organizations can establish online social networks for potential volunteers. In addition, nonprofit organizations need to invest more resources to enhance the digital literacy of employees and volunteers, in order to enhance the quality of online volunteering services.

<title>Patterns of ties in problem-solving networks and their dynamic properties</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75221-3</url>
<snippet>Understanding the functions carried out by network subgraphs is important to revealing the organizing principles of diverse complex networks. Here, we study this question in the context of collaborative problem-solving, which is central to a variety of domains from engineering and medicine to economics and social planning. We analyze the frequency of all three- and four-node subgraphs in diverse real problem-solving networks. The results reveal a strong association between a dynamic property of network subgraphs-synchronizability-and the frequency and significance of these subgraphs in problem-solving networks. In particular, we show that highly-synchronizable subgraphs are overrepresented in the networks, while poorly-synchronizable subgraphs are underrepresented, suggesting that dynamical properties affect their prevalence, and thus the global structure of networks. We propose the possibility that selective pressures that favor more synchronizable subgraphs could account for their abundance in problem-solving networks. The empirical results also show that unrelated problem-solving networks display very similar local network structure, implying that network subgraphs could represent organizational routines that enable better coordination and control of problem-solving activities. The findings could also have potential implications in understanding the functionality of network subgraphs in other information-processing networks, including biological and social networks.

<snippet>The values that people hold are linked to their economic performance. These links can be either direct or indirect, operating through moderating variables such as social network participation, interpersonal trust, trust in institutions, human capital, managerial skills and hours worked. In this paper these effects are studied using structural equation modelling (SEM) methodology applied to European Social Survey data from 28 European countries in 2018. Schwartz classification of values is used, distinguishing between Self-Enhancement (Power, Achievement), Openness to Change (Self-Direction), Conservation (Tradition, Security, Conformity) and Self-Transcendence (Universalism, Benevolence) values. It is found that Power has the strongest positive direct effect on economic performance, further strengthened by a positive indirect structural effect through hours worked. Self-Direction is indirectly positively linked to economic performance through higher managerial skills and hours worked. Tradition has a strong negative direct effect on economic performance. Security is indirectly negatively linked with economic performance, owing to its negative effects on interpersonal trust, management skills and hours worked. Some of the identified effects are context-dependent and vary across European welfare state regimes. For example, Power is statistically significantly linked to economic performance only in the liberal and conservative regime. Values promoted by respective welfare state regimes are not necessarily associated with higher incomes within those regimes, e.g., Tradition and Security values promoted in the conservative and Mediterranean regime are associated with lower incomes. These findings may lead to a range of policy implications, particularly in relation to the policies on immigration, demographics, the labor market, and work-life balance. Unfortunately, due to the cross-sectional character of the dataset, causal relations among the variables of interest could not be identified.

<title>The influence of gender ratios on academic careers: Combining social networks with tokenism</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207337</url>
<snippet>This paper examines how gender proportions at the workplace affect the extent to which individual networks support the career progress (i.e. time to promotion). Previous studies have argued that men and women benefit from different network structures. However, the empirical evidence about these differences has been contradictory or inconclusive at best. Combining social networks with tokenism, we show in a longitudinal academic study that gender-related differences in the way that networks affect career progress exist only in situations where women are in a token position. Our empirical results further show that women not in severely underrepresented situations benefit from the same network structure as men.

<title>A Social Network Analysis on Venture Capital Alliance's Exit from an Emerging Market</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/4650160</url>
<snippet>This study investigated the impacts of network structure on a venture capital (VC) alliance's successful exit from an emerging market by empirically analyzing joint VC data in China. We find that, compared to a mature capital market, the mechanism not only has a certain commonality but also shows the emerging market's particularities. From the commonality perspective, the mechanism has a positive effect on successful exit by obtaining heterogeneity information. These particularities are manifested in the following three aspects. First, the mechanism is not conducive to deepening the enterprise value chain to establish credibility by obtaining short-term cash during an initial public offering with the enhancement of the VC alliance's intervention ability for enterprise development. In addition, a VC alliance's independent judgment is bound by the VC market. Furthermore, the problem of over-trust in investees reduces the likelihood of a VC alliance's successful exit. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the particularity of emerging markets such as China to improve the relevant management mechanism.

<title>Can social network analysis contribute to supply chain management? A systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e26598</url>
<snippet>Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a modeling technique and analytical approach well-suited for identifying and examining the structural features of supply networks and the patterns of connections between members within the network. This paper aims to present a systematic review and bibliometric analysis by investigating network structural properties and metrics in supply chain management (SCM) research. The approach involved combining a systematic literature review with a bibliometric analysis, forming a two-part methodology to examine 113 articles published between 2008 and 2023 in 62 journals. Our systematic thematic analysis reveals how SCM researchers have applied SNA techniques in terms of the reported node-level and networklevel structural metrics, including network configuration description metrics, centrality measures, supply network subgroups, and models of supply network structure and formation. We identify the gaps in the existing body of literature and propose potential directions for future research. By quantitatively analyzing, classifying, and visualizing bibliographic data of previous studies, this paper provides further insights into the application of network structural properties in SCM research. Furthermore, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the significance of the supply network's relational structure and configuration. Considering the disruptions to global supply chains caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russo-Ukrainian War, our findings can contribute to a better understanding of strategic supply network design.

<title>Networks and epidemic models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2005.0051</url>
<snippet>Networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a network,. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks-and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm-have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures. Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control.

<title>Once a friend, always a friend? Effects of homophily on women's support networks across a decade</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-8733(96)00290-0</url>
<snippet>This study uses data collected on 42 women and 432 members of their social networks across a 10-year period beginning with the women's return to school in midlife. The paper addresses three questions: (1) To what extent did the same individuals continue to be active members of the women's social support networks across the decade; (2) to what extent did educational similarity explain which individuals continued to be active members of the women's networks; and (3) did educational similarity explain patterns of both support and socializing? The analyses revealed that between one-quarter and one-third of the associates named as sources of school/work support, general emotional support or socializing continued to be named 10 years after the first interview. The analyses also demonstrated that associates' educational attainment was important in explaining which individuals continued to serve as sources of support for school/work; however, educational attainment was not important in explaining which associates continued to serve as sources of either general emotional support or socializing.

<title>What Drives Sustainable Brand Awareness: Exploring the Cognitive Symmetry between Brand Strategy and Consumer Brand Knowledge</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12020198</url>
<snippet>The explosive development of social media has given great opportunities to academic and industry research on consumer brand knowledge. Particularly, the brand associative network has been most frequently used to describe consumer brand knowledge structure. However, few researchers have examined the embedded connotation of the brand knowledge structural measurement in regard to sustainable brand performance and adjusted their brand strategies accordingly. Combining psychological cognitive theory and the network analytic method, this paper aims to extend this area by investigating the relationship between brand structural position in consumers' associative knowledge network and sustainable brand awareness. Using a monthly dataset of around 130 million user posts, we find that compared to a prior determined brand strategy, brand network centrality in consumer's brand associative knowledge network shows a much more significant positive effect on sustainable brand awareness. Importantly, we further examined the symmetric matching of brand positioning strategy and consumer's brand knowledge structure for sustainable brand awareness. We find that sustainable brand awareness will be promoted by a symmetric matching brand positioning strategy with its position in the associative knowledge work. Our study facilitates an understanding of brands based on consumer perceptions for managers and enables businesses to adjust their relevant strategies for the achievement of sustainable brand performance.

<title>Harvesting connections: the role of stakeholders' network structure, dynamics and actors' influence in shaping farmers' markets</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-024-10563-6</url>
<snippet>Farmers' markets (FMs) represent a crucial player in urban food systems, being the interconnection of local agricultural production and consumption, and serving as spaces for both economic exchange and community building. Despite their transformative potential, there is a scarcity of research that comprehensively investigates the dynamics of FMs network structure and the influence of the actors shaping FMs. The present article delves into the network of relationships within FMs in the Italian city of Bologna. This study adopts the Social Network Analysis (SNA) methodology applied with the Net-Map tool. The research objectives are to visualise the underlying network structure, map the dynamics, and identify the key actors who play pivotal roles in Bologna's FMs and their level of influence. The research carried out interviews with ten FMs stakeholders, revealing the network of relationships between 54 actors, divided into three categories-civil society, food economy and public administration. Actors were linked by a total of 428 relationships across three types of networks: support, economic, and hindering. Findings indicate a strong support network structure characterised by varying degrees of centrality among different actors. Farmers emerge as a central node due to their pivotal role in providing fresh, local produce. Additionally, local institutions contribute significantly to FMs resilience and growth. Our research demonstrates the importance of recognising the embeddedness of FMs within the local context. By understanding the network structure and influential actors in FMs, policymakers can devise more effective policies for promoting local agriculture, and enhancing the sustainability of urban-rural exchanges. In conclusion, the present study offers valuable insights into the network dynamics of FMs, highlighting their crucial role in the sustainable development of urban and local food systems.

<title>&lt;i&gt;Affinity Paths&lt;/i&gt; and information diffusion in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2010.11.003</url>
<snippet>Widespread interest in the diffusion of information through social networks has produced a large number of Social Dynamics models. A majority of them use theoretical hypothesis to explain their diffusion mechanisms while the few empirically based ones average out their measures over many messages of different contents. Our empirical research tracking the step-by-step email propagation of an invariable viral marketing message delves into the content impact and has discovered new and striking features. The topology and dynamics of the propagation cascades display patterns not inherited from the email networks carrying the message. Their disconnected, low transitivity, tree-like cascades present positive correlation between their nodes probability to forward the message and the average number of neighbors they target and show increased participants' involvement as the propagation paths length grows. Such patterns not described before, nor replicated by any of the existing models of information diffusion, can be explained if participants make their pass-along decisions based uniquely on local knowledge of their network neighbors affinity with the message content. We prove the plausibility of such mechanism through a stylized, agent-based model that replicates the Affinity Paths observed in real information diffusion cascades. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

<title>Birds of a feather: Homophily in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.415</url>
<snippet>Similarity breeds connection. This principle-the homophily principle-structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and

<title>It takes two: A dyadic model of recruitment to civic activity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.07.008</url>
<snippet>Why are some people, but not others, asked to engage in civic activity? Rather than focus on the personal traits of either potential recruits or recruiters for this initial stage of recruitment, we develop and test a theoretical framework that emphasizes the importance of shared relationships and characteristics between those doing the recruiting and those being recruited. Specifically, the nature of interactions, overlapping community and associational space, status and value homophily, and strength and intimacy are assessed to explain differential recruitment among people's closest ties. Furthermore, unlike previous studies, we do so across three different forms of civic activity blood donation, volunteer work, and political activism allowing us to identify larger patterns in civic solicitation. Results from multilevel analyses of dyads reorganized from ego-centric data of U.S. adults show that while certain personal traits of egos and alters remain significant, attributes of the dyad are equally, if not more, consequential for explaining variation in who gets asked to participate in civic activity. Importantly, while certain dyadic characteristics such as romantic partnerships promote recruitment to all three forms of civic activity, the effects of others such as sex homophily are unique to specific forms. Broadly speaking, our results indicate that some types of dyadic characteristics are more powerful than others and that there are important differences in how particular dimensions of social connections shape recruitment efforts across the specific activities of donating blood, volunteering time, and engaging in political activism.

<title>The Earnings of Immigrant and Native-Born Men in Canada: The Role of Social Networks and Social Capital</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380253.2018.1526054</url>
<snippet>Using data from the Canadian General Social Survey (2008), this study considers the role of social networks in immigrants' earnings. Despite higher levels of education, immigrants continue to earn less than native-born Canadians. This paper shows that social network characteristics are associated with earnings net of the effects of human capital and visible minority status. Social networks are important for understanding immigrants' earnings both as a direct cause of employment disadvantages and as a force that exacerbates the disadvantages that immigrants face due to racial discrimination, a lack of proficiency in Canada's official languages, and/or discrepancies over foreign credentials. While most current data on immigrant networks is limited to specific ethnic groups, cities, and/or occupations, the present study contributes to scholarship by generalizing data to all immigrants in Canada. This study also expands the temporal scope by comparing immigrants who arrived in the 2000s, 1990s, and earlier. Future research and public policy should put greater emphasis on the role of social networks in the economic integration of new immigrants.

<title>Game Changer: The Topology of Creativity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/681213</url>
<snippet>This article examines the sociological factors that explain why some creative teams are able to produce game changers-cultural products that stand out as distinctive while also being critically recognized as outstanding. The authors build on work pointing to structural folding-the network property of a cohesive group whose membership overlaps with that of another cohesive group. They hypothesize that the effects of structural folding on game changing success are especially strong when overlapping groups are cognitively distant. Measuring social distance separately from cognitive distance and distinctiveness independently from critical acclaim, the authors test their hypothesis about structural folding and cognitive diversity by analyzing team reassembly for 12,422 video games and the career histories of 139,727 video game developers. When combined with cognitive distance, structural folding channels and mobilizes a productive tension of rules, roles, and codes that promotes successful innovation. In addition to serving as pipes and prisms, network ties are also the source of tools and tensions.

<title>Seed Selection Strategies for Information Diffusion in Social Networks: An Agent-Based Model Applied to Rural Zambia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4429</url>
<snippet>The successful adoption of innovations depends on the provision of adequate information to farmers. In rural areas of developing countries, farmers usually rely on their social networks as an information source. Hence, policy-makers and program-implementers can benefit fromsocial diffusion processes to effectively disseminate information. This study aims to identify the set of farmers who initially obtain information ('seeds') that optimises diffusion through the network. It systematically evaluates different criteria for seed selection, number of seeds, and their interaction effects. An empirical Agent-Based Model adjusted to a case study in rural Zambia was applied to predict diffusion outcomes for varying seed sets ex ante. Simulations revealed that informing farmers with the most connections leads to highest diffusion speed and reach. Also targeting village heads and farmers with high betweenness centrality, who function as bridges connecting different parts of the network, enhances diffusion. An increased number of seeds improves reach, but the marginal effects of additional seeds decline. Interdependencies between seed set size and selection criteria highlight the importance of considering both seed selection criteria and seed set size for optimising seeding strategies to enhance information diffusion.

<snippet>Building on the literature that stresses the social capital advantages of open and diffuse social networks, this article shows that African American boys who are a social bridge across two or more large but cohesive peer groups are less delinquent than are their counterparts who are members of a single peer group. Statistical interaction terms reveal that this decrease in delinquency can be attributed to the increased influence of parents among social bridges. The article concludes that the network form of the adolescent society, independent of its composition, conditions the parent-child relationship.

<title>Good health and the bridging of structural holes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2008.10.005</url>
<snippet>Bridges that span structural holes are often explained in terms of the entrepreneurial personalities or rational motivations of brokers, or structural processes that lead to the intersection of social foci. I argue that the existence and use of bridges in interpersonal networks also depends on individuals' health. Poor health may make it more difficult to withstand the pressures and to execute some of the common tasks associated with bridging(e.g., brokerage). I examine this possibility using egocentric network data on over 2500 older adults drawn from the recent National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). Multivariate regression analyses show that both cognitive and functional health are significantly positively associated with bridging, net of sociodemographic and life-course controls. The relationship between functional (kinesthetic) health and bridging appears to be partially mediated by network composition, as older adults who have poorer functional health also tend to have networks that are richer in strong ties. Several potential mediation mechanisms are discussed. Cognitive function remains significantly associated with bridging net of network composition, Suggesting that the inherent challenges of maintaining bridging positions may be more difficult to cope with for those who have cognitive impairments than for those who have functional impairments such as limited mobility. An alternative explanation is that cognitively impaired individuals have more difficulty recognizing (and thus strategically using) bridges in their networks. Theoretical implications and possibilities for future research are discussed.

<title>Obstacle avoidance in social groups: new insights from asynchronous models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2015.0178</url>
<snippet>For moving animals, the successful avoidance of hazardous obstacles is an important capability. Despite this, few models of collective motion have addressed the relationship between behavioural and social features and obstacle avoidance. We develop an asynchronous individual-based model for social movement which allows social structure within groups to be included. We assess thedynamics of groupnavigation and resulting collision risk in the context of information transfer through the system. In agreement with previous work, we find that group size has a nonlinear effect on collision risk. We implement examples of possible network structures to explore the impact social preferences have on collision risk. We show that any social heterogeneity induces greater obstacle avoidance with further improvements corresponding to groups containing fewer influential individuals. The model provides a platform for both further theoretical investigation and practical application. In particular, we argue that the role of social structures within bird flocks may have an important role to play in assessing the risk of collisions with wind turbines, but that new methods of data analysis are needed to identify these social structures.

<title>Bridging Boundaries? The Effect of Genetic Ancestry Testing on Ties across Racial Groups</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spab082</url>
<snippet>The phenomenon of widespread genetic ancestry testing has raised questions about its social impact, particularly on issues of race. Some accounts suggest testing can promote bridging social capital - connections between racial groups. In this multi-method paper, we ask whether (1) taking genetic ancestry tests (GATs) and (2) receiving results of African, Asian, or Native American ancestry increases network racial diversity for White Americans. We use a randomized controlled trial of 802 White, non-Hispanic Americans, half of whom received GATs. Unexpected findings show that test-takers' network racial diversity decreases after testing. Using 58 follow-up interviews, we develop and test a possible theory, finding initial evidence that test-takers' network racial diversity declines because they reconsider their racial appraisals of others in their networks.

<snippet>Artisan entrepreneurship is an important way to develop economic prosperity in cultural industry, but there is a lack of systematic and quantitative review guidance. With 818 SSCI documents from the Web of Science database from 1992 to 2022, this paper uses bibliometric and visualization analysis methods to review and sort out the research in the field of artisan entrepreneurship, reveal the knowledge base and research hotspots, and put forward suggestions and outlook. The study finds that the knowledge bases of artisan entrepreneurship research include cultural entrepreneurship theory, resources-based theory, social network theory, family entrepreneurship theory and micro-theory of tourism industry development. The research hotspots focus on six themes: artisan entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial drivers, factors influencing the entrepreneurial process of artisans, economic value, cultural values, and social values. Finally, the existing theoretical framework of artisan entrepreneurship is integrated and future research directions and perspectives are proposed from six perspectives.

<title>Information Network Among Farmers: A Case Study in Ghana</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440241228696</url>
<snippet>It is well established that a person's productivity is strongly related to interactions among their network cycles. Despite this, much of the literature concerning farmers' productivity describes only their formal relationships with extension officials, ignoring their personal relationships. This study was motivated by the need to understand how farmers can use their social networks to promote information diffusion and learning among themselves. The study assessed whether farmers' information networks can positively influence their productivity and performance through the study of their network structure. We used survey data from 200 Ghanaian farmers. The data was then analyzed using descriptive statistics and an exponential random graph model (ERGM). The results of this study showed that farmers' information networks had a positive effect on their performance and productivity. The study also revealed that farmers seek information from key and influential farmers while key farmers also seek information from other key farmers. A further finding of the study showed that many factors contributed to the successful diffusion of information, such as popularity, activity spread, reciprocity, multiple connections, and homophily of experience. However, on the other hand, transitivity was not significant in this network. Hence, this study clarifies the effect of the structural characteristics of farmers' information network which influence information diffusion for higher performance and productivity. This study argues that agricultural managers should take measures to ensure that farmers understand how their information network can benefit their peers, as well as their own performance and productivity. Studies have shown that, personal interaction and networks has the ability to influence a person's productivity. But most of the existing literature concentrate much on the formal relationships with extension officials, ignoring personal relationships.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2012.06.004</url>
<snippet>This paper introduces and tests a novel methodology for measuring networks. Rather than collecting data to observe a network or several networks in full, which is typically costly or impossible, we randomly sample a portion of individuals in the network and estimate the network based on the sampled individuals' perceptions on all possible ties. We find the methodology produces accurate estimates of social structure and network level indices in five different datasets. In order to illustrate the performance of our approach we compare its results with the traditional roster and ego network methods of data collection. Across all five datasets, our methodology outperforms these standard social network data collection methods. We offer ideas on applications of our methodology, and find it especially promising in cross-network settings. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Team talk: Learning, jargon, and structure versus the pulse of the network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.05.002</url>
<snippet>We began this work intending to illustrate the network origins of jargon, a signal feature of team learning and the division of labor. In the process, we came to recognize the substantive importance of message timing, which we discuss as the pulse of a network. This paper describes our route to that recognition. We analyze data from a renovated classic network experiment providing empirical support for three hypotheses. The first, and most familiar from past work, is that teams moving down their learning curve to greater efficiency are prone to shared jargon. As a team moves down its learning curve, language drifts away from day-to-day speech, into jargon. The second and third hypotheses concern network correlates of the drift. With respect to network structure, teams are less likely to converge on jargon when communication is concentrated in one teammate. With respect to pulse, teams are more likely to converge on jargon when communication efforts are numerous and crowded in time. The two network predictors overlap conceptually. They both involve learning and access to information, but are distinct in their mechanism: Structure provides access. Pulse creates motivation to access. Teammates keeping up with numerous messages concentrated in time have a shared incentive to find shorthand terms (i.e., jargon) that enable faster exchange of accurate information. Network structure predicts team convergence on jargon, but pulse is a stronger predictor. Directions for new research are discussed.

<title>Community responses to national healthcare firms</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Over the last 25 years, national Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) and hospital firms attempted to enter local markets, either by acquiring formerly independent, locally based HMOs and hospitals or by directly entering local markets. While national HMOs have been relatively successful, national hospital firms have had much less success. This paper explores the reasons for this difference. It reviews changes in presence of national HMO and hospital firms in markets, discusses common conceptual lenses through which national entry into local markets typically has been viewed, and shows how social network theory can be used to develop a better understanding of why the entry experience of national HMO and hospital firms varies across markets. The paper concludes with a research agenda that addresses issues raised by social network theory and its application to national firm entry into local markets.

<snippet>For different currents in policy analysis as policy networks and the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), identifying coalitions from policy beliefs and coordination between actors is crucial to a precise understanding of a policy process. Focusing particularly the relational dimension of ACF approaches linked with policy network analysis, determining policy subsystems from the actor collaborations and exchanges has recently begun offering fertile links with the network analysis. Studies in this way frequently apply Block Modeling and Community Detection (BMCD) strategies to define homogeneous political groups. However, the BMCD literature is growing quickly, using a wide variety of algorithms and interesting selection methods that are much more diverse than those used in the policy network analysis and particularly the ACF when this current focused on the collaboration networks before or after regarding the belief distance between actors. Identifying the best methodological option in a specific context can therefore be difficult and few ACF studies give an explicit justification. On the other hand, few BMCD publications offer a systematic comparison of real social networks and they are never applied to policy network datasets. This paper offers a new, relevant 5-Step selection method to reconcile advances in both the policy networks/ACF and BMCD. Using an application based on original African policy network data collected in Madagascar and Niger, we provide a useful set of practical recommendations for future ACF studies using policy network analysis: (i) the density and size of the policy network affect the identification process, (ii) the "best algorithm"can be rigorously determined by maximizing a novel indicator based on convergence and homogeneity between algorithm results, (iii) researchers need to be careful with missing data: they affect the results and imputation does not solve the problem.

<title>Venture Capital Syndication Network Structure of Public Companies: Robustness and Dynamic Evolution, China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems11060302</url>
<snippet>Venture capital plays a vital role in boosting economic growth by providing an inexhaustible impetus for economic innovation and development. We use all the joint venture capital events of Chinese listed companies in the past 10 years to describe the characteristics of the joint venture capital network structure, identify the dynamic evolution characteristics of the community, and introduce random attacks and deliberate attacks to explore the resilience of joint venture capital cooperation. The study finds that the joint venture capital network in China has expanded in scale, with an increasing number of participants and a diversified investment industry. However, the connection between members within the network remains relatively loose, indicating fragmentation and a need to improve network quality. The community structure of core members is significant, with evident differences in scale. The network exhibits weak robustness, relying heavily on key enterprises and demonstrating a poor ability to resist external interference. The study proposes countermeasures and suggestions for optimizing the network structure of joint venture capital, aiming to enhance the environment and performance of joint venture capital and promote the high-quality development of China's joint venture capital market.

<title>'Entanglement' - A new dynamic metric to measure team flow</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.11.010</url>
<snippet>We introduce "entanglement", a novel metric to measure how synchronized communication between team members is. This measure calculates the Euclidean distance among team members' social network metrics timeseries. We validate the metric with four case studies. The first case study uses entanglement of 11 medical innovation teams to predict team performance and learning behavior. The second case looks at the e-mail communication of 113 senior executives of an international services firm, predicting employee turnover through lack of entanglement of an employee. The third case analyzes the individual employee performance of 81 managers. The fourth case study predicts performance of 13 customer-dedicated teams at a big international company by comparing entanglement in the e-mail interactions with satisfaction of their customers measured through Net Promoter Score (NPS). While we can only speculate about what is causing the entanglement effect, we find that it is a new and versatile indicator for the analysis of employees' communication, analyzing the hitherto underused temporal dimension of online social networks which could be used as a powerful predictor of employee and team performance, employee turnover, and customer satisfaction.

<title>Group threat, political extremity, and collective dynamics in online discussions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-28569-1</url>
<snippet>Collectives adapt their network structure to the challenges they face. It has been hypothesized that collectives experiencing a real or imagined threat from an outgroup tend to consolidate behind a few group members, and that network structures in which a few members attract most of the attention are more likely in politically extreme groups. These hypotheses have not been tested in large-scale real-world settings. We reconstruct networks of tens of thousands of commenters participating in comment sections of high-profile U.S. political news websites spanning the political spectrum from left to right, including Mother Jones, The Atlantic, The Hill, and Breitbart. We investigate the relationship between different indices of inequality of attention in commenters' networks and perceived group threat associated with significant societal events, from elections and political rallies to mass shootings. Our findings support the hypotheses that groups facing a real or imagined outgroup threat and groups that are more politically extreme are more likely to attend to a few high-profile members. These results provide an extensive real-world test of theoretical accounts of collective adaptation to outgroup threats.

<title>Origins of Homophily in an Evolving Social Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/599247</url>
<snippet>The authors investigate the origins of homophily in a large university community, using network data in which interactions, attributes, and affiliations are all recorded over time. The analysis indicates that highly similar pairs do show greater than average propensity to form new ties; however, it also finds that tie formation is heavily biased by triadic closure and focal closure, which effectively constrain the opportunities among which individuals may select. In the case of triadic closure, moreover, selection to "friend of a friend" status is determined by an analogous combination of individual preference and structural proximity. The authors conclude that the dynamic interplay of choice homophily and induced homophily, compounded over many "generations" of biased selection of similar individuals to structurally proximate positions, can amplify even a modest preference for similar others, via a cumulative advantage like process, to produce striking patterns of observed homophily.

<title>Seeing things clearly: social structure, personality, and accuracy in social network perception</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-8733(98)00008-2</url>
<snippet>People differ in their ability to perceive accurately the informal patterns of interpersonal relationships in their social groups, i.e., the group's network structure. Existing research leaves us largely unable to explain the variation in accuracy in social network perception. This paper argues that the study of accuracy in social network perception should consider the effect of both situational factors and individual differences. To explore this claim, three research centers in an Italian university were studied. Perceptions of the friendship and the work-related advice networks in the organization were compared to the actual network. The results indicate that both an observer's position in the formal and informal social structure of the organization, and his or her personality traits contribute to determining accuracy in social network perception.

<title>Modelling and analysis of big data platform group adoption behaviour based on social network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101570</url>
<snippet>Due to the importance of big data technology in decision-making, production and service provision, enterprises have adopted various big data technologies and platforms to improve their operational efficiency. However, the number of enterprises that have adopted big data is not promising. The purpose of this study is to explore the current status of big data adoption by Chinese enterprises and to reveal the possible factors that hinder big data adoption from the group behaviour network perspective. Based on a real case survey of 54 big data platforms (BDPs), four types of networks-i.e., the enterprise-platform network, enterprise network, platform network and industry similarity and difference (ISD) network-are constructed and analysed on the basis of social network analysis (SNA). This study finds that among Chinese enterprises, the level and scope of big data adoption are generally low and are imbalanced among industries; the cognitive level and adoption behaviour of enterprises on BDPs are inconsistent, the compatibility of BDPs is different, and the density and distance-based cohesion of networks are weak; although the current big data adoption behaviours of Chinese enterprises have formed some structural features, core-periphery structures and maximal complete cliques are found, and the current network structure has little impact on individual enterprises and platforms; enterprises in the same industry prefer to adopt the same kind of big data technology or platform. Based on these findings, several strategies and suggestions to improve big data adoption are provided.

<title>Emoticon-Based Ambivalent Expression: A Hidden Indicator for Unusual Behaviors in Weibo</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147079</url>
<snippet>Recent decades have witnessed online social media being a big-data window for testifying conventional social theories quantitatively and exploring much detailed human behavioral patterns. In this paper, by tracing the emoticon use in Weibo, a group of hidden "ambivalent users" are disclosed for frequently posting ambivalent tweets containing both positive and negative emotions. Further investigation reveals that this ambivalent expression could be a novel indicator of many unusual social behaviors. For instance, ambivalent users with the female as the majority like to make a sound in midnights and at weekends. They mention their close friends frequently in ambivalent tweets, which attract more replies and serve as a more private communication way. Ambivalent users also respond differently to public affairs from others and demonstrate more interests in entertainment and sports events. Moreover, the sentiment shift in ambivalent tweets is more evident than usual and exhibits a clear "negative to positive" pattern. The above observations, though being promiscuous seemingly, actually point to the self-regulation of negative mood in Weibo, which could find its basis from the traditional emotion management theories in sociology but makes an important extension to the online environment in this study. Finally, as an interesting corollary, ambivalent users are found connected with compulsive buyers and turn out to be perfect targets for online marketing.

<title>Age, gender, personality, ideological attitudes and individual differences in a person's news spectrum: how many and who might be prone to "filter bubbles" and "echo chambers" online?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03214</url>
<snippet>Potential effects of demographics, personality, and ideological attitudes on the number of news sources consumed should be investigated. The number of news sources consumed, in turn, was seen as inverse proxy for the susceptibility to be caught in "filter bubbles" and/or "echo chambers" (online), which are hotly discussed topics also in politics. A sample of 1,681 (n = 557 males) participants provided data on demographics, the Big Five as well as Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) alongside the number of different news sources consumed and current voting preferences. Results showed that age (positively), gender (higher in males), Openness (positively), and RWA (negatively) predicted the number of different news sources consumed. The group of participants consuming news exclusively offline showed highest scores in Conscientiousness and lowest scores in Neuroticism compared to the "news feeds only" and the "news feeds and online" groups. However, less than 5&#37; of the participants exclusively consumed news via news feeds of social networking sites. Participants who stated that they would not vote reported the lowest number of different news sources consumed. These findings reveal first insights into predisposing factors for the susceptibility to be caught in "filter bubbles" and/or "echo chamber" online and how this might be associated with voting preferences.

<title>Beauty and social capital: Being attractive shapes social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2017.05.003</url>
<snippet>It is a fact of life that being beautiful is advantageous (Hamermesh, 2011). Whether we consider incomes or the marriage market, the more attractive one is, the better one does. Drawing on psychological research that explains why beauty pays, we hypothesize that more attractive people will exploit social network opportunities differently than less attractive people and, consequently, their networks will comprise more beneficial features. As predicted, results of an experiment showed that more attractive people were more likely to select for themselves more profitable broker positions in networks relative to other positions and relative to less attractive people. Relying on network data supplied by young professionals, in a follow-up study we found that the networks of more attractive people were relatively less dense, as the findings of Study 1 would imply. We discuss the implications for our work as well as highlight the need for further research into an understudied, but potentially influential brokerage contingency factor physical appeal.

<title>Approximating individual interactions in compartmental system dynamics models</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sdr.1599</url>
<snippet>This paper introduces an approach known as a pair approximation developed in physics and mathematical biology that captures some of the effects of network structure in a compartmental system dynamics (CSD) model without substantially increasing model complexity or computational efficiency. We describe the approach using a familiar example: the standard SIS model from epidemiology that underpins many models from the marketing and innovation diffusion literature. We show that the pair approximation better approximates the results of an agent-based simulation than the standard CSD. The model provides insights regarding the epidemic threshold, with implications for halting the spread of a disease or encouraging the spread of a product, that cannot be obtained from the standard CSD. We further illustrate the technique through the development of two new CSD models: a model of social contagion, SIS2, that allows for social recovery, and a model of technology adoption with local network effects.

<title>The Structure of Negative Social Ties in Rural Village Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.15195/v6.a8</url>
<snippet>Negative (antagonistic) connections have been of longstanding theoretical importance for social structure. In a population of 24,696 adults interacting face to face within 176 isolated villages in western Honduras, we measured all connections that were present, amounting to 105,175 positive and 16,448 negative ties. Here, we show that negative and positive ties exhibit many of the same structural characteristics. We then develop a complete taxonomy of all 138 possible triads of two-type relationships. Consistent with balance theory, we find that antagonists of friends and friends of antagonists tend to be antagonists; but, in an important empirical refutation of balance theory, we find that antagonists of antagonists also tend to be antagonists, not friends. Finally, villages with comparable levels of animosity tend to be geographically proximate. Similar processes, involving social contact, give rise to both positive and negative social ties in rural villages, and negative ties play an important role in social structure.

<title>Network structure shapes the impact of diversity in collective learning</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-52837-3</url>
<snippet>It is widely believed that diversity arising from different skills enhances the performance of teams, and in particular, their ability to learn and innovate. However, diversity has also been associated with negative effects on the communication and coordination within collectives. Yet, despite the importance of diversity as a concept, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of how its impact is shaped by the underlying social network. To fill this gap, we model skill diversity within a simple model of collective learning and show that its effect on collective performance differs depending on the complexity of the task and the network density. In particular, we find that diversity consistently impairs performance in simple tasks. In contrast, in complex tasks, link density modifies the effect of diversity: while homogeneous populations outperform diverse ones in sparse networks, the opposite is true in dense networks, where diversity boosts collective performance. Our findings also provide insight on how to forge teams in an increasingly interconnected world: the more we are connected, the more we can benefit from diversity to solve complex problems.

<title>Network formation in organizational settings: Exploring the importance of local social processes and team-level contextual variables in small groups using bayesian hierarchical ERGMs</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.07.001</url>
<snippet>Statistical models for social networks, such as exponential random graphs (ERGMs), have increasingly been used by organizational scholars to study the social interactions inside organizations, departments, and teams. While such models have been successful in providing insights about the local processes that underlie these interactions (such as homophily, reciprocity or transitivity), an additional interesting avenue for research focuses on the role of group -level contextual variables (such as the climate or composition of a team or organization) when considering a multitude of teams or organizations. In this paper we show how, in a team context, integrating team -level factors in a multilevel framework (i.e., a Bayesian hierarchical ERGM) enables us to answer questions about: 1) how team -level contextual factors might provide alternative explanations for the emergence of intra-team ties, and 2) whether any variation in local tendencies between teams might be dependent on such team -level variables (i.e., cross -level interactions). Using data collected among 103 MBA students who were grouped into 18 teams of 5-7 members to work on a project, we study the impact of members' expertise and perceived psychological safety on advice seeking behavior. At a local level, we focus on the effect of these nodal attributes for homophily and differences in advice seeking and giving, while at the team level we incorporate the average expertise and the team's psychological safety climate. Our results show that expert members are more likely to be the recipient of advice ties, but also that this effect is more pronounced in teams where the overall level of expertise is high. For psychological safety, we find that a high psychological safety climate impacts the advice relations among all members in the group, not solely those who themselves perceive a high level of psychological safety, suggesting that the team climate has an impact on all its members. This illustrates how a Bayesian hierarchical ERGM allows us to obtain relevant results even when studying small -sized groups.

<title>Social context and network formation: An experimental study</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2008.10.001</url>
<snippet>Recently, there has been increasing interest in determining which social network structures emerge as a consequence of the conscious actions of actors. Motivated by the belief that "networks matter" in reaching personal objectives, it is a natural assumption that actors try to optimize their network position. Starting from the notion that an optimal network position depends on the social context, we examine how actors change their networks to reach better positions in various contexts. Distinguishing between three social contexts (a neutral context, a context in which closed triads are costly, and a context in which closed triads are beneficial), theoretical results predict that emerging networks are contingent on the incentives that are present in these contexts. Experiments are used to test whether networks that are theoretically predicted to be stable are also stable experimentally. We find that emerging networks correspond to a large extent with the predicted networks. Consequently, they are contingent on the incentives present in various social contexts. In addition, we find that subjects tend to form specific stable networks with a higher probability than predicted, namely, efficient networks and networks in which everyone is equally well off.

<title>Partnership Ties Shape Friendship Networks: A Dynamic Social Network Study</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/sov079</url>
<snippet>Partnership ties shape friendship networks through different social forces. First, partnership ties drive clustering in friendship networks: individuals who are in a partnership tend to have common friends and befriend other couples. Second, partnership ties influence the level of homophily in these emerging friendship clusters. Partners tend to be similar in a number of attributes (homogamy). If one partner selects friends based on preferences for homophily, then the other partner may befriend the same person regardless of whether they also have homophilic preferences. Thus, two homophilic ties emerge based on a single partner's preferences. This amplification of homophily can be observed in many attributes (e.g., ethnicity, religion, age). Gender homophily, however, may be de-amplified, as the gender of partners differs in heterosexual partnerships. In our study, we follow dynamic friendship formation among 126 individuals and their cohabiting partners in a university-related graduate housing community over a period of nine months (N = 2,250 self-reported friendship relations). We find that partnership ties strongly shape the dynamic process of friendship formation. They are a main driver of local network clustering and explain a striking amount of homophily.

<title>Global structures and local network mechanisms of knowledge-flow networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246660</url>
<snippet>Understanding the patterns and underlying mechanisms that come into play when employees exchange their knowledge is crucial for their work performance and professional development. Although much is known about the relationship between certain global network properties of knowledge-flow networks and work performance, less is known about the emergence of specific global network structures of knowledge flow. The paper therefore aims to identify a global network structure in blockmodel terms within an empirical knowledge-flow network and discuss whether the selected local network mechanisms are able to drive the network towards the chosen global network structure. Existing studies of knowledge-flow networks are relied on to determine the local network mechanisms. Agent-based modelling shows the selected local network mechanisms are able to drive the network towards the assumed hierarchical global structure.

<title>Detecting and modelling real percolation and phase transitions of information on social media</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01090-z</url>
<snippet>Xie et al. directly observe the percolation phase transition of information on large-scale online social media and find that the positive-feedback coevolution between users' activity level and network structure greatly increases the spreading power. It is widely believed that information spread on social media is a percolation process, with parallels to phase transitions in theoretical physics. However, evidence for this hypothesis is limited, as phase transitions have not been directly observed in any social media. Here, through an analysis of 100 million Weibo and 40 million Twitter users, we identify percolation-like spread and find that it happens more readily than current theoretical models would predict. The lower percolation threshold can be explained by the existence of positive feedback in the coevolution between network structure and user activity level, such that more-active users gain more followers. Moreover, this coevolution induces an extreme imbalance in users' influence. Our findings indicate that the ability of information to spread across social networks is higher than expected, with implications for many information-spread problems.

<title>Residential mobility and the spatial dispersion of personal networks: Effects on social support</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2011.07.003</url>
<snippet>Using a representative national sample of personal networks, this article explores how the spatial dispersion of networks, residential mobility and social support are linked. Three issues will be addressed here. Firstly, how is the spatial dispersion of personal networks related to individuals' social characteristics, network composition and residential mobility? Secondly, how do the spatial dispersion of networks, residential mobility and their combined effect influence the number and (thirdly) the structure of emotional support ties? Results showed that the extent of the support was affected neither by the geographical distribution of the networks nor by residential mobility. Living far from one's birthplace, however, exerted two distinct, and opposite effects on the support network structure. On the one hand, mobility led to high spatial dispersion of personal contacts, which in turn favored a sparsely knit network centered around the mobile individual. On the other hand, by controlling for the effect of distance between the contacts, we found that individuals that cited long-distance ties tended to be part of more transitive support networks than those that cited local ties. We interpreted the latter effect as evidence that transitive ties may survive greater spatial distances than intransitive ones. These findings are discussed in view of spatial mobility and social network research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Who Says What in Which Networks: What influences Social Media Users' Emotional Reactions to the COVID-19 Vaccine Infodemic?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393221128940</url>
<snippet>This study aims to identify effective predictors that influence publics' emotional reactions to COVID-19 vaccine misinformation as well as corrective messages. We collected a large sample of COVID-19 vaccine related misinformation and corrective messages on Facebook as well as the users' emotional reactions (i.e., emojis) to these messages. Focusing on three clusters of features such as messages' linguistic features, source characteristics, and messages' network positions, we examined whether users' reactions to misinformation and corrective information would differ. We used random forest models to identify the most salient predictors among over 70 predictors for both types of messages. Our analysis found that for misinformation, political ideology of the message source was the most salient feature that predicted anxious and enthusiastic reactions, followed by message features that highlight personal concerns and messages' network positions. For corrective messages, while the sources' ideology was still key to raising anxiety, the most important feature for triggering enthusiasm was the messages' network positions and message quality.

<snippet>As a platform for discussion and communication, talk pages play an essential role in Wikipedia to facilitate coordination, sharing of information and knowledge resources among Wikipedians. In this work we explore the influence of network structures of these pages on the efficiency of WikiProjects. Project efficiency is measured as the amount of work done by project members in a quarter. The study uses the comments on WikiProject talk pages to construct communication networks. The structural properties of these networks are studied using ideas from social network theory. We develop three hypotheses about how network structures influence project effectiveness and examine the hypotheses using a longitudinal dataset of 362 WikiProjects. The evaluation suggests that an intermediate level of cohesion with a core of influential users dominating network flow improves effectiveness for a WikiProject, and that greater average membership tenure relates to project efficiency in a positive way. We discuss the implications of this analysis for the future management of WikiProjects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>The strength of a weak tie in the innovative performance of firms: A case of Korean high-tech manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/soc4.13214</url>
<snippet>This study explores whether the 'strength of weak ties' theory, derived from social network theory, can equally apply to business activities. To address this question, we conduct an empirical analysis, utilising 3-year panel data encompassing 3881 samples of Korean small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the high-tech manufacturing sector. The primary objective is to examine the effects of inter-corporate tie strength on innovative performance. The results reveal an interesting pattern in high-tech manufacturing corporations, where the strength of a tie demonstrates an inverted U-shaped relationship with an SME's patent achievement. Moreover, we observe that the effect of tie strength on an SME's patent achievement is positively moderated by its research and development (R&amp;D) intensity. Furthermore, when an SME maintains weak ties within its relationship with a large corporation, its innovative performance experiences a more positive impact than in cases where no relationship with a large corporation exists, or strong ties are maintained. These findings suggest that for SMEs, maintaining an appropriate level of embeddedness with large corporations is an effective strategy for generating sustained innovative performance within an environment characterised by active technological innovation and intense competition. The principal contribution of this paper lies in the empirical validation of the theory of weak ties concerning a firm's innovative performance.

<title>The ties that bind global governance: Using media-reported events to disentangle the global interorganizational network in a global pandemic</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.02.012</url>
<snippet>This article disentangles the global interorganizational network by analyzing the ties of international actors comprising multinational companies, intergovernmental organizations, and international nongovernmental organizations. The onset of COVID-19 is a rare opportunity to explore how this network has evolved in an exogenous event. Using a unique GDELT big dataset of events reported by the world's media, we extract and analyze the interorganizational interactions of international actors before and after the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the COVID-19 outbreak was a public health emergency of international concern. Adopting an exploratory and descriptive approach at multiple levels of analysis, we draw on the theory of networks to uncover the fragmented, polycentric, and complex characteristics of the global interorganizational network. Our study highlights the use of media-reported events and the Goldstein scale as means to unpack the difficult-to-capture relational dynamics of international actors, which can help in theory development of the global interorganizational network that is crucial for collective action to address societal grand challenges.

<title>Short- and long-term stability in organizational networks: Temporal structures of project teams</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2013.07.001</url>
<snippet>Network research focuses on patterns of stable relationships, where stability represents the unfolding of social processes over long time frames. We argue that social interactions exhibit important regularities in different time frames (short and long term), reflecting distinct social processes. We illustrate the value of this distinction through a comparative case study of technology-mediated communication, within two project teams in a digital marketing agency. We examine how the embedding of interpersonal interactions in processes of reciprocity and closure over different time horizons enables the emergence of cohesion in the face of constant compositional changes. We propose that the time frames in which stable patterns of interactions develop are the key to understanding the nature of the underlying social processes with short-term patterns of closure and reciprocity representing adaptation to change while longer term patterns indicate cohesion. Our results are supportive of this argument and show that the two teams exhibit the same regularities in interactions but across different time horizons. We discuss the implication of our findings and argue that distinguishing between short- and long-term stability of social networks offers a novel and promising avenue for network research.

<title>Teammate invitation networks: The roles of recommender systems and prior collaboration in team assembly</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.04.008</url>
<snippet>Teammate invitation networks are foundational for team assembly, and recommender systems (similar to dating websites, but for selecting potential teammates) can aid the formation of such networks. This paper extends Hinds et al.'s (2000) influential model of team member selection by incorporating online recommender systems. Exponential random graph modeling of two samples (overall N = 410; 63 teams; 1,048 invitations) shows the invitation network is predicted by online recommendations, beyond previously-established effects of prior collaboration/familiarity, skills/competence, and homophily. Importantly, online recommendations are less heeded when there is prior collaboration (this effect replicates across samples). This study highlights technologyenabled team assembly from a network perspective.

<title>Positive Emotions, Instrumental Resources, and Organizational Network Evolution: Theorizing via Simulation Research</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2020.08.007</url>
<snippet>In the workplace, people seek positive emotional experiences as well as instrumental resources while doing their work. Yet we know little about how affective micro-dynamics drive the evolution of organizational networks, influence network trajectories, and determine macro outcomes such as collective affect and overall network structure. Given the lack of theory on affective micro-dynamics and network evolution, we propose a model that includes both affective and instrumental micro-mechanisms and use simulation methods to explore evolutionary dynamics and develop new theory. The core of our model is the empirically observed tendency for people forego the acquisition of instrumental resources to avoid a decrease in positive emotion when choosing inter-action partners. We conduct "experiments" with the simulation, considering the effects of the tradeoff, dispositional affect, resource inequality, and ingroup favoritism. The results show that dispositional affect and the tradeoff have considerable effects on network trajectories, collective affect, and resource transfer. We provide new theoretical propositions about affect in organizations.

<title>Entrepreneurial orientation and innovation performance: the mediating effect of social network ambidexterity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2023.2172567</url>
<snippet>The aim of this study is to adopt the perspective of organisational ambidexterity to explore the relationships between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and innovation performance (IP). Based on the resource-based view and social network theory, this study constructs a theoretical model to investigate the relationship between EO and IP, as well as the mediation of network ambidexterity. The empirical results show that EO has a positive and direct impact on IP. The dimensions of network ambidexterity both mediate the relationships between EO and IP. More importantly, the combined dimension has a stronger effect than the balance.

<title>Microblog credibility indicators regarding misinformation of genetically modified food on Weibo</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252392</url>
<snippet>The considerable amount of misinformation on social media regarding genetically modified (GM) food will not only hinder public understanding but also mislead the public to make unreasoned decisions. This study discovered a new mechanism of misinformation diffusion in the case of GM food and applied a framework of supervised machine learning to identify effective credibility indicators for the misinformation prediction of GM food. Main indicators are proposed, including user identities involved in spreading information, linguistic styles, and propagation dynamics. Results show that linguistic styles, including sentiment and topics, have the dominant predictive power. In addition, among the user identities, engagement, and extroversion are effective predictors, while reputation has almost no predictive power in this study. Finally, we provide strategies that readers should be aware of when assessing the credibility of online posts and suggest improvements that Weibo can use to avoid rumormongering and enhance the science communication of GM food.

<title>Ego centered social network and relationship quality: linking attachment security and relational models to network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.07.002</url>
<snippet>According to Dunbar's social brain hypothesis, brain capacity puts a limit on the size of social network in humans. At the same time, emotional-cognitive systems such as attachment and different relational models (Fiske, 1991) may also act as driving forces behind network structure underlying relationship quality of the various ego-centered layers. The aim of our study was to examine how these cognitive systems may contribute to network organization. We examined the two inner layers of the ego-network in 274 volunteers, the support and sympathy groups, as well as close family members in comparison to friends within the support group, in terms of attachment security and underlying relational models.

<title>Social Support and the Religious Dimensions of Close Ties</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12134</url>
<snippet>Despite the influence of social support on physical and mental health, few studies have examined why some close ties are more supportive than others. Though religion provides a rich context for social interaction and a meaningful social identity, it has received little attention in the social support literature. A growing literature on religion and health offers insight into how religion affects social support processes. Using dyadic network data derived from the nationally representative 2006 Portraits of American Life Study, I examine how the religious dimensions of close, nonhousehold ties relate to provision of social support. Results from logistic regression analyses indicate that (controlling for a range of other social tie characteristics) same-faith ties are significantly more likely to be sources of help in times of need, while religious discussion is a strong predictor of receiving both help and advice. The effect of religious homophily is strongest for evangelical Protestants and African-American Protestants. My findings underscore the need for social support researchers to consider the role of religion in shaping support processes in close relationships.

<title>Examining cross-disciplinary communication's impact on multidisciplinary collaborations: implications for innovations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1139611</url>
<snippet>Many research organizations are shifting to networked structures to foster the creation of innovation. However, the study of the network form of research organizations is rare and the collaborative process in such networks has yet to be revealed. This study analyses the relationship between networked structure, disciplinary diversity, and multidisciplinary outputs. Using social network, co-authorship, and interview data collected from the GRAND NCE, a Canadian research network, this paper examines how researchers' memberships in multiple projects, diversity in their communication networks, and researchers' personal interests in developing cross-boundary ties with other GRAND members influence the production of multidisciplinary outcomes. Using a new framework to study the complex relationships between factors at the organizational, project, and individual levels, this study shows that the diversity in the communication network has a direct impact on the number of multidisciplinary outputs and the diversity in co-authorship networks, which could be the source of future innovation. The analyses also indicate that the network structure can facilitate boundary-spanning communication, and this allows researchers who are interested in multidisciplinary collaborations to carry out their desires. Furthermore, the qualitative data show that collaborators would work together in cross-disciplinary ties to identify common research topics, exchange advice, and help solve problems. Such activities are considered to be the activities that lead to multidisciplinary outcomes.

<title>A new methodology to measure faultlines at scale leveraging digital traces</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00350-w</url>
<snippet>The definition of society is tight with human group-level behavior. Group faultlines defined as hypothetical lines splitting groups into homogeneous subgroups based on members' attributes have been proposed as a theoretical method to identify conflicts within groups. For instance, crusades and women's rights protests are the consequences of strong faultlines in societies with diverse cultures. Measuring the presence and strength of faultlines represents an important challenge. Existing literature resorts in questionnaires as traditional tool to find group-level behavioral attributes and thus identify faultlines. However, questionnaire data usually come with limitations and biases, especially for large-scale human group-level research. On top of that, questionnaires limit faultline research due to the possibility of dishonest answers, unconscientious responses, and differences in understanding and interpretation. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for measuring faultlines in large-scale groups, which leverages data readily available from online social networks' marketing platforms. Our methodology overcomes the limitations of traditional methods to measure group-level attributes and group faultlines at scale. To prove the applicability of our methodology, we analyzed the faultlines between people living in Spain, grouped by geographical regions. We collected data on 67,270 interest topics from Facebook users living in Spain, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. We computed existing metrics to measure faultlines' distance and strenght using our data to identify potential faultlines existing among Spanish regions. The results reveal that the strongest faultlines in Spain belong to Spanish Islands (the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands), Catalonia, and Basque regions. These findings are aligned with the historical secessionist movements and cultural diversity reports supporting the validity of our methodology.

<title>Post-merger cultural integration from a social network perspective: a computational modeling approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-012-9139-5</url>
<snippet>Although cultural integration, or sharing a common corporate culture, is crucial for the success of mergers, previous studies have been limited to firm-level analyses. From a social network perspective, this study explores how cultural integration emerges from the patterns of social interactions among individuals. Using an agent-based model, we investigate the impact of network structures within and between two merging firms on post-merger cultural integration and organizational dysfunctions-individual turnover, interpersonal conflict and organizational communication ineffectiveness-that arise from insufficient cultural integration. The simulation results demonstrate that the highest level of cultural integration is achieved when social ties are more centralized within each merging firm and the social ties between the merging firms are less concentrated on central individuals. Additionally, the results show that within-firm and between-firm network structures significantly affect individual turnover, interpersonal conflict and organizational communication ineffectiveness, and that these three outcome measurements do not vary in tandem.

<title>The motivational foundation of social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-8733(01)00052-1</url>
<snippet>The origins of motivations for network behavior are found in modem theories of early childhood development. There are two types of early motivations: safety on the one hand and efficacy on the other. Safety corresponds to and is generated by networks of cohesion, while efficacy comes about from separation and corresponds to networks with structural holes and is typical of brokerage situations. Both cohesion and brokerage are necessarily involved in any network situation as a matter of fundamental theoretical necessity, but they occur under different circumstances in individual and organizational action. Studies axe reviewed that show that effective relations both within and between organizations require both cohesive bases and brokerage between otherwise not well connected units.

<title>Beyond network centrality: individual-level behavioral traits for predicting information superspreaders in social media</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwae073</url>
<snippet>Understanding the heterogeneous role of individuals in large-scale information spreading is essential to manage online behavior as well as its potential offline consequences. To this end, most existing studies from diverse research domains focus on the disproportionate role played by highly connected 'hub' individuals. However, we demonstrate here that information superspreaders in online social media are best understood and predicted by simultaneously considering two individual-level behavioral traits: influence and susceptibility. Specifically, we derive a nonlinear network-based algorithm to quantify individuals' influence and susceptibility from multiple spreading event data. By applying the algorithm to large-scale data from Twitter and Weibo, we demonstrate that individuals' estimated influence and susceptibility scores enable predictions of future superspreaders above and beyond network centrality, and reveal new insights into the network positions of the superspreaders. While many works measured the role of social hubs for information spreading in social media, a new algorithm reveals that anticipating future superspreaders requires both individual characteristics and network structure.

<title>Team efficiency and network structure: The case of professional League of Legends</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.03.004</url>
<snippet>Teams can be defined by their interactions and successful performance rests on their members' behaviour. Although this topic has been studied both in sports and management, research on computer mediated team interactions, communication, cooperative work and efficiency in online competitive environments is scarce. In this article, networks will be used as a novel approach to understand how League of Legends professional players assist each other during a competitive match and to link their computer mediated behaviour and social interactions to their teams performance. Starting from a dataset consisting of 453.386 kill assists, the network structure and efficiency is assessed over 7.582 matches in total. After controlling for potential mixed-effects, such as the quality of the involved teams or their geography, this study reinforces previous research showing that team efficiency in the League of Legends professional scene is positively affected by the intensity of their interaction while centralization of resources is detrimental. Networks with high intensity and low inner centralization are, therefore, related to a higher performance as a team not only in traditional sports but also in computer mediated contexts.

<title>The study of aggression and affiliation motifs in bottlenose dolphins' social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-22071-w</url>
<snippet>Networks in biology have provided a powerful tool to describe and study very complex biological processes and systems such as animal societies. Social network analysis allows us to assess different processes occurring in animal groups. In the current study, we use this approach to investigate how conflict dynamics and post-conflict interactions shape the social networks of groups of captive bottlenose dolphins. We first examined temporal changes and aggression-affiliation motifs in the observed dolphins' network structure. Using the results of the previous analysis, we built two models that simulate the dynamics of aggression and affiliation in a small dolphin group. The first model is based only on the observed statistics of interactions, whereas the second includes post conflict memory effects as well. We found that the resulting social networks and their most common motifs matched the association patterns observed in wild and captive dolphins. Furthermore, the model with memory was able to capture the observed dynamics of this group of dolphins. Thus, our models suggest the presence and influence of post-conflict behaviors on the structure of captive dolphins' social networks. Therefore, the network approach reveals as an effective method to define animal social networks and study animal sociality. Finally, this approach can have important applications in the management of animal populations in captive settings.

<title>Exploring and visualizing spatial-temporal evolution of patent collaboration networks: A case of China?s intelligent manufacturing equipment industry</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101483</url>
<snippet>With the integration of intelligent manufacturing (IM) technology and the manufacturing industry, the intelligent manufacturing equipment industry (IMEI) has become the focus of a new round of industrial revolution. This integration has led to a new revolution in the manufacturing industry and is key to transforming China into a manufacturing country with international competitiveness. However, China?s IMEI is in the development stage, thus presenting a major challenge to it becoming a competitive core industry. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore the IMEI patent collaboration network and analyze its evolutionary characteristics, which can improve not only the innovation ability of network organizations but also the overall competitiveness of the IMEI. This study employs social network analysis (SNA) to study the evolution of the patent collaboration network of China?s IMEI. The results show that the number of co-patents for the IMEI field in China has obvious stage characteristics, the collaborative innovation patterns adopted by different provinces vary, and the State Grid has a strong influence on the network. The scale of the patent collaboration network is gradually expanding, exhibiting a ?small-world? structure. Jiangsu mainly innovates through intra-provincial collaboration. Provinces such as Beijing, Guangdong and Shandong are more inclined to inter-provincial collaboration.

<title>The impact of CEO characteristics on the international entrepreneurship of small island- based firms</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.24043/isj.406</url>
<snippet>This paper examines the impact of CEO characteristics on the International Entrepreneurship (IE) of listed island-based firms (IBFs) during the period 2009-2018. The research considers 164 companies from a sample of eight small islands with securities exchanges including more than one firm headquartered on the island. The selected islands are: Barbados, Cyprus, Fiji, Iceland, Jamaica, Malta, Mauritius, and Trinidad &amp; Tobago. Framed on the upper echelons theory and social network theory, the influence on IE of CEO's tenure, academic background and achievement, family allegiance, and international exposure is studied, taking into account the small island particularities. Through a binary probit model, it is concluded that CEOs' family allegiance, tenure, and academic background (if the CEO majored in Business Administration, Finance, Accounting, or Economics) are negatively related with IE, while CEOs' academic achievement and international exposure are positively associated with IE. Some of these results are atypical in the existing literature; nevertheless, islandness can explain these results. The conclusions attained suggest new theoretical and empirical lines of IE research for IBFs.

<title>Everyone does it-differently: A window into emerging adults' smartphone use</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00863-1</url>
<snippet>Concerns regarding smartphones' and social media's impact on youth remain high amidst a growing realization that current research is not designed to confirm (or refute) such concerns. This study aims to answer fundamental questions regarding youths' use of smartphones, by implementing a novel user-centric research method. The smartphone use of 114 emerging adults was recorded, followed by in-depth interviews that incorporated the recording and in-app information to help participants recall their behaviours, motivations, and feelings. Results indicate that smartphone use is indeed ubiquitous; 88 out of 114 participants started using their smartphone as soon as they were left alone. However, the findings of this study also demonstrate great diversity in smartphone use, in e.g. social media platforms used and motivations for using different apps. These results illustrate that it no longer seems sensible to refer to "screen time" as if it represents a homogeneous phenomenon across youth. Additionally, preliminary indications have been found of relationships between individual differences in mental health indices and variations in smartphone use. The current study provides new insights into youths' smartphone use and its relationship with wellbeing.

<title>Gender inequities in the online dissemination of scholars' work</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2102945118</url>
<snippet>Unbiased science dissemination has the potential to alleviate some of the known gender disparities in academia by exposing female scholars' work to other scientists and the public. And yet, we lack comprehensive understanding of the relationship between gender and science dissemination online. Our largescale analyses, encompassing half a million scholars, revealed that female scholars' work is mentioned less frequently than male scholars' work in all research areas. When exploring the characteristics associated with online success, we found that the impact of prior work, social capital, and gendered tie formation in coauthorship networks are linked with online success for men, but not for women-even in the areas with the highest female representation. These results suggest that while men's scientific impact and collaboration networks are associated with higher visibility online, there are no universally identifiable facets associated with success for women. Our comprehensive empirical evidence indicates that the gender gap in online science dissemination is coupled with a lack of understanding the characteristics that are linked with female scholars' success, which might hinder efforts to close the gender gap in visibility.

<title>Investigating social media's impact on the new era of interactive learning: A case study of Bangladesh</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e26234</url>
<snippet>This study aims to clarify how social media and smart devices affect the modern interactive learning process, particularly in Bangladesh, a South Asian nation. Several hypotheses have been formulated to support the notion that social media and digital gadgets have a favorable impact on interactive learning. These hypotheses were evaluated by surveying students to gauge their perceptions. This in-depth study uses data from an online survey administered to 350 students at various universities in Bangladesh to inquire into the ways in which these students make use of mobile devices like smartphones, laptops etc. and social media platforms to enhance their learning in an interactive manner, with their instructors, and amongst themselves. The examination and instrument validation techniques used an indirect structural equation model. The research found that students' interactions with their peers and teachers, as well as their tendency to share what they've learned online, were all significantly influenced by their participation in group efforts via online social networking. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that students' interactions with instructors, peers, and online information-sharing practices greatly impact student engagement, which impacts academic achievement. This study's findings suggest that students who work together to learn on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are more likely to be creative, motivated, as well as committed to academic exploration.

<title>Suicide Ideation of Individuals in Online Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062262</url>
<snippet>Suicide explains the largest number of death tolls among Japanese adolescents in their twenties and thirties. Suicide is also a major cause of death for adolescents in many other countries. Although social isolation has been implicated to influence the tendency to suicidal behavior, the impact of social isolation on suicide in the context of explicit social networks of individuals is scarcely explored. To address this question, we examined a large data set obtained from a social networking service dominant in Japan. The social network is composed of a set of friendship ties between pairs of users created by mutual endorsement. We carried out the logistic regression to identify users' characteristics, both related and unrelated to social networks, which contribute to suicide ideation. We defined suicide ideation of a user as the membership to at least one active user-defined community related to suicide. We found that the number of communities to which a user belongs to, the intransitivity (i.e., paucity of triangles including the user), and the fraction of suicidal neighbors in the social network, contributed the most to suicide ideation in this order. Other characteristics including the age and gender contributed little to suicide ideation. We also found qualitatively the same results for depressive symptoms.

<title>Collaboration Networks in Applied Conservation Projects across Europe</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164503</url>
<snippet>The main funding instrument for implementing EU policies on nature conservation and supporting environmental and climate action is the LIFE Nature programme, established by the European Commission in 1992. LIFE Nature projects (&gt;1400 awarded) are applied conservation projects in which partnerships between institutions are critical for successful conservation outcomes, yet little is known about the structure of collaborative networks within and between EU countries. The aim of our study is to understand the nature of collaboration in LIFE Nature projects using a novel application of social network theory at two levels: (1) collaboration between countries, and (2) collaboration within countries using six case studies: Western Europe (United Kingdom and Netherlands), Eastern Europe (Romania and Latvia) and Southern Europe (Greece and Portugal). Using data on 1261 projects financed between 1996 and 2013, we found that Italy was the most successful country not only in terms of awarded number of projects, but also in terms of overall influence being by far the most influent country in the European LIFE Nature network, having the highest eigenvector (0.989) and degree centrality (0.177). Another key player in the network is Netherlands, which ensures a fast communication flow with other network members (closeness-0.318) by staying connected with the most active countries. Although Western European countries have higher centrality scores than most of the Eastern European countries, our results showed that overall there is a lower tendency to create partnerships between different organization categories. Also, the comparisons of the six case studies indicates significant differences in regards to the pattern of creating partnerships, providing valuable information on collaboration on EU nature conservation. This study represents a starting point in predicting the formation of future partnerships within LIFE Nature programme, suggesting ways to improve transnational cooperation and communication.

<title>Stewardship of global collective behavior</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2025764118</url>
<snippet>Collective behavior provides a framework for understanding how the actions and properties of groups emerge from the way individuals generate and share information. In humans, information flows were initially shaped by natural selection yet are increasingly structured by emerging communication technologies. Our larger, more complex social networks now transfer high-fidelity information over vast distances at low cost. The digital age and the rise of social media have accelerated changes to our social systems, with poorly understood functional consequences. This gap in our knowledge represents a principal challenge to scientific progress, democracy, and actions to address global crises. We argue that the study of collective behavior must rise to a "crisis discipline" just as medicine, conservation, and climate science have, with a focus on providing actionable insight to policymakers and regulators for the stewardship of social systems.

<title>The Impact of a Researcher's Structural Position on Scientific Performance: An Empirical Analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0161281</url>
<snippet>This article discusses the nature and structure of scientific collaboration as well as the association between academic collaboration networks and scientific productivity. Based on empirical data gathered from the CVs of 73 researchers affiliated with an academic research network in Canada, this study used social network analysis (SNA) to examine the association between researchers' structural position in the network and their scientific performance. With reference to Granovetter's and Burt's theories on weak ties and structural holes, we argue it is the bridging position a researcher holds in a scientific network that matters most to improve scientific performance. The results of correlation scores between network centrality and two different indicators of scientific performance indicate there is a robust association between researchers' structural position in collaboration networks and their scientific performance. We believe this finding, and the method we have developed, could have implications for the way research networks are managed and researchers are supported.

<title>The distribution of initial estimates moderates the effect of social influence on the wisdom of the crowd</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20551-7</url>
<snippet>Whether, and under what conditions, groups exhibit "crowd wisdom" has been a major focus of research across the social and computational sciences. Much of this work has focused on the role of social influence in promoting the wisdom of the crowd versus leading the crowd astray and has resulted in conflicting conclusions about how social network structure determines the impact of social influence. Here, we demonstrate that it is not enough to consider the network structure in isolation. Using theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and reanalysis of four experimental datasets (totaling 2885 human subjects), we find that the wisdom of crowds critically depends on the interaction between (i) the centralization of the social influence network and (ii) the distribution of the initial individual estimates. By adopting a framework that integrates both the structure of the social influence and the distribution of the initial estimates, we bring previously conflicting results under one theoretical framework and clarify the effects of social influence on the wisdom of crowds.

<title>Product Diffusion Using Advance Selling Strategies: An Online Social Network Perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3207</url>
<snippet>This study analyzes the diffusion of two product types using an advance selling strategy from a social network perspective. We extended the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model by adding a buyer component (SIRB) to the model and conducted an in-depth analysis of transmission probability and purchase probability when using an advance selling strategy. Agent-based simulation indicates that cost reduction and promotional effort have positive effects on profits, while lead time negatively affects them. Statistical analyses indicate that lead time has a U-shaped relationship with profits for non-durable products, but an inverted U-shaped relationship with those for durable products. For both products types, promotional effort has an inverted U-shaped relationship with profits under the condition of low-quality products and an inverted U-shaped relationship in the case of high-quality products. The reasons underlying these results are discussed, followed by implications for firms adopting advance selling strategies.

<title>Airbnb on TikTok: Brand Perception Through User Engagement and Sentiment Trends</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393241260242</url>
<snippet>This study delves into Airbnb's brand presence on TikTok by analyzing textual content in posts, and human audio in videos. This approach aims to decipher the brand narrative and gauge user engagement. In the dynamic realm of social media marketing, TikTok has emerged as a key platform in shaping brand perception. This research specifically concentrates on Airbnb's content, distinguishing between official narratives and user-generated content (UGC). Notably, themes of "Travel" dominate official posts, contrasting with "Real Estate" and "Business" in UGC. The methodology employed involves advanced data collection techniques, including web scraping for textual data and artificial intelligence for transcribing human audio to text. The findings reveal that UGC commands greater engagement and volume compared to Airbnb's own brand content, underscoring the increasing significance of user involvement in brand storytelling. An analysis of the study results is conducted using linguistic natural processing (LNP) for the sentiment base, and the vector space model for emotion analysis. Sentiment analysis reveals a predominance of the emotion "happiness" and a significant presence of "surprise" in the posts, both of which are critical for audience engagement. Moreover, the study indicates a high approval rate for Airbnb-related content, reflecting a positive reception of the brand. Additionally, the research observes that influencers, particularly nano influencers, have higher engagement rates, indicating that their authenticity and relatability appeal especially to Generation Z audiences. This study not only sheds light on the intricate relationship between brand narrative, user engagement, and sentiment on TikTok but also offers valuable insights into effective brand image construction and propagation in the digital era, highlighting the importance of diverse emotions in enhancing audience engagement.

<title>Networked framing of GMO risks and discussion fragmentation on Chinese social media: a dynamic perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02564-3</url>
<snippet>Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have been highly controversial in China and beyond. The burgeoning of social media has created an online activist field where participants utilize networked framing practices to engage in connective actions related to GMO risks. However, a dynamic perspective on the co-production of GMO risk discourses has yet to be fully explored, and it is still under debate whether such a collective interpretation is fragmented. To address this gap, this study investigates the risk-invoked GMO controversy by longitudinally exploring the structural characteristics and discursive power structures in the networked framing of GMO risks on social media. This study examines 356,227 GMO risk posts from 2010 to 2020 on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. A longitudinal social network analysis and computational text-mining approach are used to construct representation networks among participants based on their joint sponsorship framing practices of GMO risks. The findings suggest that there is a multipolar discussion fragmentation in the networked framing of GMO risks. However, the temporal evidence shows that the risk discussion has become increasingly interconnected and less structurally fragmented over time. In addition, this study highlights the unequal distribution of discursive power among participants; nevertheless, the analysis reveals that this inequality has shown signs of easing over the study period. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the GMO controversy from a risk perspective and sheds light on the dynamics of networked framing practices and discursive power structures on social media.

<title>Collapse of an online social network: Burning social capital to create it?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.11.004</url>
<snippet>The last decade has shown that sometimes even the largest online social networks (OSNs) collapse. Significant cascading mechanisms have been identified in the pattern of abandoning the OSN iWiW at its peak of popularity and after. We set out to examine the key actors who were the first to leave their networks by contrasting explanations based on the structural position of users in the network. Using heterogeneous choice models, we found that a higher number of connections as well as less clustered ego-networks hindered early abandonment while early adoption was only a secondary factor.

<title>Who runs the arts in England? A social network analysis of arts boards</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2022.101646</url>
<snippet>Recent research on cultural production has drawn attention to significant inequalities. This paper aims to unpack one possible explanation for these inequalities by focusing on the people with ultimate responsibility for arts institutions: the boards of directors. Using data from the UK's Companies House, it analyses the boards of Arts Council England's National Portfolio Organisations. It then "hops" to the other organisations with whom arts organisations also share board members, and their directors. While the network of NPOs is relatively sparse, with most organisations not sharing board members with any others, in the one-hop network the majority of these organisations are indirectly connected to one another. In addition to a large number of arts and cultural organisations, this network also contains a large proportion of film funding companies and financial services companies. The most central company in the network, measured by betweenness, is the Royal Opera House, followed by companies associated with significant tax advantages for their directors. Our results raise questions for the governance of culture, drawing further attention to its ties with financial institutions.

<title>Crafting Mosaics: Person-Centered Religious Influence and Selection in Adolescent Friendships</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12638</url>
<snippet>This research addresses the intersection of two key domains of adolescents' lives: religion and peer networks. Religion scholars argue that religion is multi-faceted and better understood by focusing on combinations of indicators (i.e., mosaics), versus a variable-centered approach. We adopt this framework and investigate the interplay between religion and peer networks, both in how religious mosaics are shaped by friends and how religious profiles affect friend selection dynamics. With data from two schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate religious mosaics using latent class analysis (LCA) to identify profiles consisting of combinations of commonly available survey-based measures of religious attitudes, behaviors, and identities. Finding evidence of theoretically expected profiles, we then use stochastic actor-based models (SABMs) to investigate network dynamics for these LCA-based religious profiles. We demonstrate how the profile data can be integrated within the SABM framework to evaluate processes of friend selection and influence. Results show evidence of adolescents influencing one another's religious mosaics, but not selecting friends on that basis.

<title>Interagency collaboration within the city emergency management network: a case study of Super Ministry Reform in China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/disa.12495</url>
<snippet>Emergencies continue to become ever more complex; responding to them, therefore, often is beyond the capabilities and capacities of any single public agency. Hence, collaboration among these actors is necessary to prepare for, respond to, and recover from such events. This seldom occurs in an effective or efficient manner, however. Drawing on resource dependence theory and the concept of social capital, this paper reveals that different types of collaborative relationships exist within the collaborative network. Super Ministry Reform of Emergency Management in China serves as a case in point. By evaluating network efficiency and classifying the collaborative relationships of involved government agencies, four types are identified: resource-redundant; resource-complementary; resource-dependent; and resource-isolated. The different influences of collaborative relationships explain why the reform is not that effective, although it has led to the merger of several core departments in the emergency management network. The findings are a reminder to consider network structure and collaboration types when engaging in institutional design.

<title>Social Network Structure as a Moderator of the Relationship between Psychological Capital and Job Satisfaction: Evidence from China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/2550944</url>
<snippet>Although networking is reported to be a job search strategy in the literature, research on the interaction between social networking and other personal resources and its effect on job satisfaction is scarce. In the perspective of social networks, the present study explored whether the social network structure, which consists of network size and tie strength, moderates the relationship between psychological capital and job satisfaction. By using a two-wave longitudinal design, we collected the quantitative data (survey of 344 undergraduate students who were about to graduate soon) from 19 universities in Beijing city, Shandong Province, and Jiangsu Province in Eastern China. Factor analysis and hierarchical regression analysis were adopted to analyze the data of the survey. We found that psychological capital has a positive impact on job seekers' job satisfaction. Furthermore, smaller networks and weaker ties in social networks both render the positive effect of psychological capital on job satisfaction even stronger.

<title>What types of brokerage bridge the research-practice gap? The case of public school educators</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.05.006</url>
<snippet>The presence of a research-practice gap is recognized across multiple fields including education, psychology, and public health. In this paper, we examine which of five structural types of brokerage are most and least effective in bridging this research-practice gap in the context of education. Using a small world survey design, we tracked how a statewide random sample of 247 K-12 principals and superintendents in Michigan seek information about social skills programs from brokering individuals and organizations. We find that some triadic brokerage structures are more effective than others in closing the communication gap between practitioners and researchers. Specifically, educators relying on itinerant brokerage, which circulates information between members of the same community, were five times less likely to obtain information from a researcher. In contrast, educators relying on representative or liaison brokerage, which facilitate information transfer between members of different communities, were more than twice as likely to obtain information from a researcher. We conclude by discussing implications for the development of interventions designed to facilitate information sharing between practitioners and researchers.

<title>Examination of public perceptions of microbes and microbiomes in the United States reveals insights for science communication</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312427</url>
<snippet>Within a changing research and media landscape, misconceptions and misinformation about microorganisms and microbiomes can arise, necessitating improvements in science communication practices through insights in public perceptions of the microbial world. Yet, little is known about public perceptions of microorganisms and microbiomes, making it difficult to develop tailored messaging. Here we perform an inductive thematic analysis with interviews and surveys from thirty adults across the United States to identify key factors to enhance microbial science communication efforts. Together, our results underscore the importance of 1) recognizing the existing and desired future knowledge of an audience, 2) aligning with broader socio-scientific issues that resonate with people in relevant channels using social networks, 3) fostering collaboration between microbiologists, social scientists, and communicators to improve messaging, and 4) appealing to people's values and emotions to establish meaningful connections. This study concludes that non-microbial interests, such as an interest in health and wellness, may lead to acquisition of microbial knowledge and that people want scientists to share microbial messages preferably on platforms like social media. Additionally, we identified confusion about microbial terms and a desire to understand human-centric benefits of microorganisms and microbiomes. We suggest that microbiologists partner with science communicators to develop microbial messaging, capitalizing on connections to non-microbial interests and appealing to people's microbial worldview.

<title>Diversity and Social Network Structure in Collective Decision Making: Evolutionary Perspectives with Agent-Based Simulations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/7591072</url>
<snippet>Collective, especially group-based, managerial decision making is crucial in organizations. Using an evolutionary theoretic approach to collective decision making, agent-based simulations were conducted to investigate how human collective decision making would be affected by the agents' diversity in problem understanding and/or behavior in discussion, as well as by their social network structure. Simulation results indicated that groups with consistent problem understanding tended to produce higher utility values of ideas and displayed better decision convergence, but only if there was no group-level bias in collective problem understanding. Simulation results also indicated the importance of balance between selection-oriented (i.e., exploitative) and variation-oriented (i.e., explorative) behaviors in discussion to achieve quality final decisions. Expanding the group size and introducing nontrivial social network structure generally improved the quality of ideas at the cost of decision convergence. Simulations with different social network topologies revealed collective decision making on small-world networks with high local clustering tended to achieve highest decision quality more often than on random or scale-free networks. Implications of this evolutionary theory and simulation approach for future managerial research on collective, group, and multilevel decision making are discussed.
