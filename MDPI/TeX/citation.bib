    abstract = {When a computer network connects people or organizations, it is a social network. Yet the study of such computer-supported social networks has not received as much attention as studies of human-computer interaction, online person-to-person interaction, and computer-supported communication within small groups. We argue the usefulness of a social network approach for the study of computer-mediated communication. We review some basic concepts of social network analysis, describe how to collect and analyze social network data, and demonstrate where social network data can be, and have been, used to study computer-mediated communication. Throughout, we show the utility of the social network approach for studying computer-mediated communication, be it in computer-supported cooperative work, in virtual community, or in more diffuse interactions over less bounded systems such as the Internet.},

	Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful

	creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age,

	higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized

	Abstract = {Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion,
	leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness.
	Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with
	people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from
	a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests
	that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be
	transferred through networks {[}Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ
	337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment
	with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs
	outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the
	amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions
	were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative
	posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern
	occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on
	Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence
	for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests
	that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and
	nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and
	that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a
	positive experience for people.},

	Abstract = {Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for
	describing and quantifying complex systems in many branches of
	science(1-3). Recent studies suggest that networks often exhibit
	hierarchical organization, in which vertices divide into groups that
	further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple
	scales. In many cases the groups are found to correspond to known
	functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in
	biochemical networks ( protein interaction networks, metabolic networks
	or genetic regulatory networks) or communities in social networks(4-7).
	Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure
	from network data and show that the existence of hierarchy can
	simultaneously explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly
	observed topological properties of networks, such as right- skewed
	degree distributions, high clustering coefficients and short path
	lengths. We further show that knowledge of hierarchical structure can be
	used to predict missing connections in partly known networks with high
	accuracy, and for more general network structures than competing
	techniques(8). Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a
	central organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering
	insight into many network phenomena.},

	Abstract = {Stochastic actor-based models are models for network dynamics that can
	represent a wide variety of influences on network change, and allow to
	estimate parameters expressing such influences, and test corresponding
	hypotheses. The nodes in the network represent social actors, and the
	collection of ties represents a social relation. The assumptions posit
	that the network evolves as a stochastic process `driven by the actors',
	i.e., the model lends itself especially for representing theories about
	how actors change their outgoing ties. The probabilities of tie changes
	are in part endogenously determined, i.e., as a function of the current
	network structure itself, and in part exogenously, as a function of
	characteristics of the nodes ('actor covariates') and of characteristics
	of pairs of nodes ('dyadic covariates'). In an extended form, stochastic
	actor-based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social
	networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors: dynamics of
	networks and behavior.
	This paper gives an introduction to stochastic actor-based models for
	dynamics of directed networks, using only a minimum of mathematics. The
	focus is on understanding the basic principles of the model,
	understanding the results, and on sensible rules for Model selection.

	Abstract = {Networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious
	diseases are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and
	early epidemiological models were based on population wide
	random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of
	contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such
	contacts forms a network,. Knowledge of the structure of the network
	allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale
	from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore,
	characteristics of mixing networks-and how these deviate from the
	random-mixing norm-have become important applied concerns that may
	enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and
	intervention measures.
	Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on
	random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social
	sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that
	allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be
	ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our
	ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a
	generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and
	disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of
	idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been
	utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to
	suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological
	modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and
	better public health through effective disease control.},

	lowered the costs of producing, distributing, and discovering news

	exposure to diverse perspectives, while others worry that they increase
	ideological segregation. We address the issue by examining web-browsing
	histories for 50,000 US-located users who regularly read online news. We
	find that social networks and search engines are associated with an
	increase in the mean ideological distance between individuals. However,
	somewhat counterintuitively, these same channels also are associated
	with an increase in an individual's exposure to material from his or her
	less preferred side of the political spectrum. Finally, the vast
	majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals
	simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream,
	news outlets, tempering the consequences-both positive and negative-of
	recent technological changes. We thus uncover evidence for both sides of
	the debate, while also finding that the magnitude of the effects is
	relatively modest.},

	Abstract = {Graph theory is a valuable framework to study the organization of
	functional and anatomical connections in the brain. Its use for
	comparing network topologies, however, is not without difficulties.
	Graph measures may be influenced by the number of nodes (N) and the
	average degree (k) of the network. The explicit form of that influence
	depends on the type of network topology, which is usually unknown for
	experimental data. Direct comparisons of graph measures between
	empirical networks with different N and/or k can therefore yield
	spurious results. We list benefits and pitfalls of various approaches
	that intend to overcome these difficulties. We discuss the initial graph
	definition of unweighted graphs via fixed thresholds, average degrees or
	edge densities, and the use of weighted graphs. For instance, choosing a
	threshold to fix N and k does eliminate size and density effects but may
	lead to modifications of the network by enforcing (ignoring)
	nonsignificant (significant) connections. Opposed to fixing N and k,
	graph measures are often normalized via random surrogates but, in fact,
	this may even increase the sensitivity to differences in N and k for the
	commonly used clustering coefficient and small-world index. To avoid
	such a bias we tried to estimate the N, k-dependence for empirical
	networks, which can serve to correct for size effects, if successful. We
	also add a number of methods used in social sciences that build on
	statistics of local network structures including exponential random
	graph models and motif counting. We show that none of the
	here-investigated methods allows for a reliable and fully unbiased
	comparison, but some perform better than others.},

	to delay slightly the time course of the outbreak without impacting the
	eventual number ill. For R-0 < 1.9, our model suggests that the rapid
	production and distribution of vaccines, even if poorly matched to
	circulating strains, could significantly slow disease spread and limit
	the number ill to < 10\% of the population, particularly if children are

	characterize the social networks of the Hadza, a population of

	behaviour extends up to two degrees of separation. Social distance
	appears to be as important as genetic relatedness and physical proximity
	in explaining assortativity in cooperation. Our results suggest that
	certain elements of social network structure may have been present at an

	just the aggregate of individual gestures, leading to a self-reinforcing
	status ranking. Winner-take- all hierarchies are discouraged, however,
	when people prefer reciprocation of their status-conferring actions. The
	model therefore depicts a status ranking as an equilibrium resulting
	from individual responses to the trade- off between social influence and
	the distaste for making unreciprocated gestures. Analysis of the model
	generates several precise predictions about the patterns that social
	networks should exhibit at equilibrium. Data on interaction in task
	groups, friendship ratings in a fraternity, and play in a set of infant

	Human interactions are not random but rather are structured in social
	networks. Importantly, ties in these networks often are dynamic,
	changing in response to the behavior of one's social partners. This
	dynamic structure permits an important form of conditional action that
	has been explored theoretically but has received little empirical
	attention: People can respond to the cooperation and defection of those
	around them by making or breaking network links. Here, we present
	experimental evidence of the power of using strategic link formation and
	dissolution, and the network modification it entails, to stabilize
	cooperation in sizable groups. Our experiments explore large-scale
	cooperation, where subjects' cooperative actions are equally beneficial
	to all those with whom they interact. Consistent with previous research,
	we find that cooperation decays over time when social networks are
	shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all rounds. We also
	find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated only infrequently,
	cooperation again fails. However, when subjects can update their network
	connections frequently, we see a qualitatively different outcome:
	Cooperation is maintained at a high level through network rewiring.
	Subjects preferentially break links with defectors and form new links
	with cooperators, creating an incentive to cooperate and leading to
	substantial changes in network structure. Our experiments confirm the
	predictions of a set of evolutionary game theoretic models and
	demonstrate the important role that dynamic social networks can play in
	supporting large- scale human cooperation.},

	Abstract = {Network models are widely used to represent relations between
	interacting units or actors. Network data often exhibit transitivity,
	meaning that two actors that have ties to a third actor are more likely
	to be tied than actors that do not, homophily by attributes of the
	actors or dyads, and clustering. Interest often focuses on finding
	clusters of actors or ties, and the number of groups in the data is
	typically unknown. We propose a new model, the latent position cluster
	model, under which the probability of a tie between two actors depends
	on the distance between them in an unobserved Euclidean `social space',
	and the actors' locations in the latent social space arise from a
	mixture of distributions, each corresponding to a cluster. We propose
	two estimation methods: a two-stage maximum likelihood method and a
	fully Bayesian method that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The
	former is quicker and simpler, but the latter performs better. We also
	propose a Bayesian way of determining the number of clusters that are
	present by using approximate conditional Bayes factors. Our model
	represents transitivity, homophily by attributes and clustering
	simultaneously and does not require the number of clusters to be known.
	The model makes it easy to simulate realistic networks with clustering,
	which are potentially useful as inputs to models of more complex systems
	of which the network is part, such as epidemic models of infectious
	disease. We apply the model to two networks of social relations. A free
	software package in the R statistical language, latentnet, is available

	friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of

	militating toward cumulative advantage and increasing inequality. Social
	scientists have established that individuals' choices are influenced by
	those of their network peers in many social domains. We suggest that the
	ubiquity of network effects and tendencies toward cumulative advantage
	are related. Inequality is exacerbated when effects of individual
	differences are multiplied by social networks: when persons must decide
	whether to adopt beneficial practices; when network externalities,
	social learning, or normative pressures influence adoption decisions;
	and when networks are homophilous with respect to individual
	characteristics that predict such decisions. We review evidence from
	literatures on network effects on technology, labor markets, education,
	demography, and health; identify several mechanisms through which
	networks may generate higher levels of inequality than one would expect
	based on differences in initial endowments alone; consider cases in
	which network effects may ameliorate inequality; and describe research
	priorities.},

	various domains such as Twitter or Facebook. In particular, degree,
	PageRank, k-core and other centralities have been adopted to rank the
	spreading capability of users in information dissemination media. So
	far, validation of the proposed predictors has been done by simulating
	the spreading dynamics rather than following real information flow in

	results have been achieved so far for the best predictor. Here, we

	modules made of strong links in functional brain networks. These modules
	are ``large-world{''} self-similar structures and, therefore, are far
	from being small-world. However, incorporating weaker ties to the
	network converts it into a small world preserving an underlying backbone
	of well-defined modules. Remarkably, weak ties are precisely organized
	as predicted by theory maximizing information transfer with minimal
	wiring cost. This trade-off architecture is reminiscent of the

	Abstract = {Current methods for the detection of contagious outbreaks give
	contemporaneous information about the course of an epidemic at best. It
	is known that individuals near the center of a social network are likely
	to be infected sooner during the course of an outbreak, on average, than
	those at the periphery. Unfortunately, mapping a whole network to
	identify central individuals who might be monitored for infection is
	typically very difficult. We propose an alternative strategy that does
	not require ascertainment of global network structure, namely, simply
	monitoring the friends of randomly selected individuals. Such
	individuals are known to be more central. To evaluate whether such a
	friend group could indeed provide early detection, we studied a flu
	outbreak at Harvard College in late 2009. We followed 744 students who
	were either members of a group of randomly chosen individuals or a group
	of their friends. Based on clinical diagnoses, the progression of the
	epidemic in the friend group occurred 13.9 days (95\% C. I. 9.9-16.6) in
	advance of the randomly chosen group (i.e., the population as a whole).
	The friend group also showed a significant lead time (p<0.05) on day 16
	of the epidemic, a full 46 days before the peak in daily incidence in
	the population as a whole. This sensor method could provide significant
	additional time to react to epidemics in small or large populations
	under surveillance. The amount of lead time will depend on features of
	the outbreak and the network at hand. The method could in principle be
	generalized to other biological, psychological, informational, or
	behavioral contagions that spread in networks.},

	turned to Facebook, the world's largest social network site, as a way to
	make users more identifiable and accountable for the content they

	discussion, even when it comes to discussing politically sensitive and
	potentially divisive issues. By analysing the content of discussion as
	it occurs in response to political news content on the Washington Post
	Facebook, and comparing it to that which occurs on the Washington Post
	website where users are afforded a relatively high level of anonymity,
	the present study determines the extent to which Facebook increases the
	level of civility and impoliteness in an area of political discussion
	renowned for uncivil and impolite communicative behaviour. In line with
	earlier theories of social interaction, the paper finds that political
	discussion on The Washington Post website is significantly more likely
	to be uncivil than discussion of the same content on the Washington Post
	Facebook page. Moreover, the incivility and impoliteness on the

	vector autoregression, we identify two positive feedback loops that lead
	to price bubbles in the absence of exogenous stimuli: one driven by word
	of mouth, and the other by new Bitcoin adopters. We also observe that
	spikes in information search, presumably linked to external events,
	precede drastic price declines. Understanding the interplay between the

	the network and information about the network nodes, such as the age or
	gender of individuals in a social network. Here we demonstrate how this
	`metadata' can be used to improve our understanding of network
	structure. We focus in particular on the problem of community detection
	in networks and develop a mathematically principled approach that
	combines a network and its metadata to detect communities more
	accurately than can be done with either alone. Crucially, the method
	does not assume that the metadata are correlated with the communities we
	are trying to find. Instead, the method learns whether a correlation
	exists and correctly uses or ignores the metadata depending on whether
	they contain useful information. We demonstrate our method on synthetic
	networks with known structure and on real-world networks, large and
	small, drawn from social, biological and technological domains.},

	investigate differences in people's access to the internet and level of
	online activity. The study not only revisits the digital divide in the
	Canadian context, but also expands current investigations by including
	an analysis of how demographic factors affect social networking site
	(SNS) adoption. The findings demonstrate that access to the internet
	reflects existing inequalities in society with income, education,
	rural/urban, immigration status, and age all affecting adoption
	patterns. Furthermore, the results show that inequality in access to the
	internet is now being mimicked in the level of online activity of
	internet users. More recent immigrants to Canada have lower rates of
	internet access; however, recent immigrants who are online have
	significantly higher levels of online activity than Canadian born
	residents and earlier immigrants. Additionally, women perform fewer
	activities online than men. People's use of SNSs differs in terms of
	education, gender, and age. Women were significantly more likely to use
	SNSs than men. Interestingly, high school graduates had the lowest
	percentage of adoption compared to all other education categories.
	Current students were by far the group that utilized SNSs the most.
	Canadian born, recent, and early immigrants all showed similar adoption
	rates of SNSs. Age is a strong predictor of SNS usage, with young people
	relying heavily on SNSs in comparison to those aged 55+. The findings
	demonstrate that the digital divide not only persists, but has expanded
	to include inequality in the level of online activity and SNS usage.},

	Abstract = {How does network structure affect diffusion? Recent studies suggest that
	the answer depends on the type of contagion. Complex contagions, unlike
	infectious diseases (simple contagions), are affected by social
	reinforcement and homophily. Hence, the spread within highly clustered
	communities is enhanced, while diffusion across communities is hampered.
	A common hypothesis is that memes and behaviors are complex contagions.
	We show that, while most memes indeed spread like complex contagions, a
	few viral memes spread across many communities, like diseases. We
	demonstrate that the future popularity of a meme can be predicted by
	quantifying its early spreading pattern in terms of community
	concentration. The more communities a meme permeates, the more viral it
	is. We present a practical method to translate data about community
	structure into predictive knowledge about what information will spread
	widely. This connection contributes to our understanding in

	have increased. After describing the raw homophily rates, we develop a

	find decreasing rates of homophily for gender but stability for race and

	improvements in model fit compared with the commonly used Markov random
	graph models. Snijders et al., however, concentrated on non-directed
	graphs, with only limited extensions to directed graphs. In particular,
	they presented a transitive closure parameter based on path shortening.
	In this paper, we explain the theoretical and empirical advantages in
	generalizing to additional closure effects. We propose three new
	triadic-based parameters to represent different versions of triadic
	closure: cyclic effects; transitivity based on shared choices of
	partners; and transitivity based on shared popularity. We interpret the
	last two effects as forms of structural homophily, where ties emerge
	because nodes share a form of localized structural equivalence. We show
	that, for some datasets, the path shortening parameter is insufficient
	for practical modeling, whereas the structural homophily parameters can
	produce useful models with distinctive interpretations. We also
	introduce corresponding lower order effects for multiple two-path
	connectivity. We show by example that the in- and out-degree
	distributions may be better modeled when star-based parameters are
	supplemented with parameters for the number of isolated nodes, sources
	(nodes with zero in-degrees) and sinks (nodes with zero out-degrees).
	Inclusion of a Markov mixed star parameter may also help model the
	correlation between in- and out-degrees. We select some 50 graph
	features to be investigated in goodness of fit diagnostics, covering a
	variety of important network properties including density, reciprocity,
	geodesic distributions, degree distributions, and various forms of
	closure. As empirical illustrations, we develop models for two sets of
	organizational network data: a trust network within a training group,
	and a work difficulty network within a government instrumentality. (C)

	of collective intelligence have suggested that the accuracy of group
	judgments requires individuals to be either independent, with

	{[}Page S (2008) The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates

	studies have supported this view by arguing that social influence
	undermines the wisdom of crowds. These results showed that individuals'

	beliefs, thereby reducing diversity without a corresponding increase in
	group accuracy {[}Lorenz J, Rauhut H, Schweitzer F, Helbing D (2011)

	community-has been identified as a potential determinant of outcomes
	ranging from education to health(1-8). However, efforts to understand
	what types of social capital matter for these outcomes have been
	hindered by a lack of social network data. Here, in the first of a pair
	of papers(9), we use data on 21 billion friendships from Facebook to
	study social capital. We measure and analyse three types of social
	capital by ZIP (postal) code in the United States: (1) connectedness
	between different types of people, such as those with low versus high
	socioeconomic status (SES); (2) social cohesion, such as the extent of
	cliques in friendship networks; and (3) civic engagement, such as rates
	of volunteering. These measures vary substantially across areas, but are
	not highly correlated with each other. We demonstrate the importance of
	distinguishing these forms of social capital by analysing their

	friends among individuals with low SES-which we term economic

	Abstract = {The evolution of cooperation in network-structured populations has been
	a major focus of theoretical work in recent years. When players are
	embedded in fixed networks, cooperators are more likely to interact
	with, and benefit from, other cooperators. In theory, this clustering
	can foster cooperation on fixed networks under certain circumstances.
	Laboratory experiments with humans, however, have thus far found no
	evidence that fixed network structure actually promotes cooperation.
	Here, we provide such evidence and help to explain why others failed to
	find it. First, we show that static networks can lead to a stable high
	level of cooperation, outperforming well-mixed populations. We then
	systematically vary the benefit that cooperating provides to one's
	neighbors relative to the cost required to cooperate (b/c), as well as
	the average number of neighbors in the network (k). When b/c > k, we
	observe high and stable levels of cooperation. Conversely, when b/c <= k
	or players are randomly shuffled, cooperation decays. Our results are
	consistent with a quantitative evolutionary game theoretic prediction
	forwhen cooperation should succeed on networks and, for the first time
	to our knowledge, provide an experimental demonstration of the power of
	static network structure for stabilizing human cooperation.},

	Abstract = {The viral spread of digital misinformation has become so severe that the
	World Economic Forum considers it among the main threats to human
	society. This spread have been suggested to be related to the similarly
	problematized phenomenon of ``echo chambers{''}, but the causal nature
	of this relationship has proven difficult to disentangle due to the
	connected nature of social media, whose causality is characterized by
	complexity, non-linearity and emergence. This paper uses a network
	simulation model to study a possible relationship between echo chambers
	and the viral spread of misinformation. It finds an ``echo chamber
	effect{''}: the presence of an opinion and network polarized cluster of
	nodes in a network contributes to the diffusion of complex contagions,
	and there is a synergetic effect between opinion and network
	polarization on the virality of misinformation. The echo chambers effect
	likely comes from that they form the initial bandwagon for diffusion.
	These findings have implication for the study of the media logic of new
	social media.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new stochastic actor-oriented model for the co-evolution of
	two-mode and one-mode networks. The model posits that activities of a
	set of actors, represented in the two-mode network, co-evolve with
	exchanges and interactions between the actors, as represented in the
	one-mode network. The model assumes that the actors, not the activities,
	have agency.
	The empirical value of the model is demonstrated by examining how
	employment preferences co-evolve with friendship and advice relations in
	a group of seventy-five MBA students. The analysis shows that activity
	in the two-mode network, as expressed by number of employment
	preferences, is related to activity in the friendship network, as
	expressed by outdegrees. Further, advice ties between students lead to
	agreement with respect to employment preferences. In addition,
	considering the multiplexity of advice and friendship ties yields a
	better understanding of the dynamics of the advice relation: tendencies
	to reciprocation and homophily in advice relations are mediated to an
	important extent by friendship relations.
	The discussion pays attention to the implications of this study in the
	broader context of current efforts to model the co-evolutionary dynamics

	social media as communication channels. Recent worldwide events, such as
	social movements in Spain or revolts in the Middle East, highlight their
	capacity to boost people's coordination. Online networks display in

	example, the existence of users with millions of online friends sheds
	doubts on the relevance of these relations. In this work, we focus on
	Twitter, one of the most popular online social networks, and find that
	the network formed by the basic type of connections is organized in
	groups. The activity of the users conforms to the landscape determined
	by such groups. Furthermore, Twitter's distinction between different
	types of interactions allows us to establish a parallelism between
	online and offline social networks: personal interactions are more
	likely to occur on internal links to the groups (the weakness of strong
	ties); events transmitting new information go preferentially through
	links connecting different groups (the strength of weak ties) or even
	more through links connecting to users belonging to several groups that

	Abstract = {Network science provides a set of quantitative methods to investigate
	complex systems, including human cognition. Although cognitive theories
	in different domains are strongly based on a network perspective, the
	application of network science methodologies to quantitatively study
	cognition has so far been limited in scope. This review demonstrates how
	network science approaches have been applied to the study of human
	cognition and how network science can uniquely address and provide novel
	insight on important questions related to the complexity of cognitive
	systems and the processes that occur within those systems. Drawing on
	the literature in cognitive network science, with a focus on semantic
	and lexical networks, we argue three key points. (i) Network science
	provides a powerful quantitative approach to represent cognitive
	systems. (ii) The network science approach enables cognitive scientists
	to achieve a deeper understanding of human cognition by capturing how
	the structure, i.e., the underlying network, and processes operating on
	a network structure interact to produce behavioral phenomena. (iii)
	Network science provides a quantitative framework to model the dynamics
	of cognitive systems, operationalized as structural changes in cognitive
	systems on different timescales and resolutions. Finally, we highlight
	key milestones that the field of cognitive network science needs to
	achieve as it matures in order to provide continued insights into the
	nature of cognitive structures and processes.},

	linking microlevel social interactions to large-scale environmental
	outcomes has remained scarce. Here, we leverage comprehensive data on
	information-sharing networks among large-scale commercial tuna fishers
	to examine how social networks relate to shark bycatch, a global
	environmental issue. We demonstrate that the tendency for fishers to
	primarily share information within their ethnic group creates segregated
	networks that are strongly correlated with shark bycatch. However, some
	fishers share information across ethnic lines, and examinations of their
	bycatch rates show that network contacts are more strongly related to
	fishing behaviors than ethnicity. Our findings indicate that social
	networks are tied to actions that can directly impact marine ecosystems,
	and that biases toward within-group ties may impede the diffusion of
	sustainable behaviors. Importantly, our analysis suggests that enhanced
	communication channels across segregated fisher groups could have
	prevented the incidental catch of over 46,000 sharks between 2008 and
	2012 in a single commercial fishery.},

	Abstract = {The late pre-Hispanic period in the US Southwest (A.D. 1200-1450) was
	characterized by large-scale demographic changes, including
	long-distance migration and population aggregation. To reconstruct how
	these processes reshaped social networks, we compiled a comprehensive
	artifact database from major sites dating to this interval in the
	western Southwest. We combine social network analysis with geographic
	information systems approaches to reconstruct network dynamics over 250
	y. We show how social networks were transformed across the region at
	previously undocumented spatial, temporal, and social scales. Using
	well-dated decorated ceramics, we track changes in network topology at
	50-y intervals to show a dramatic shift in network density and
	settlement centrality from the northern to the southern Southwest after
	A.D. 1300. Both obsidian sourcing and ceramic data demonstrate that
	long-distance network relationships also shifted from north to south
	after migration. Surprisingly, social distance does not always correlate
	with spatial distance because of the presence of network relationships
	spanning long geographic distances. Our research shows how a large
	network in the southern Southwest grew and then collapsed, whereas
	networks became more fragmented in the northern Southwest but persisted.
	The study also illustrates how formal social network analysis may be

	Abstract = {Empiric quantification of human mobility patterns is paramount for
	better urban planning, understanding social network structure and
	responding to infectious disease threats, especially in light of rapid
	growth in urbanization and globalization. This need is of particular
	relevance for developing countries, since they host the majority of the
	global urban population and are disproportionally affected by the burden
	of disease. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) data-loggers to
	track the fine-scale (within city) mobility patterns of 582 residents
	from two neighborhoods from the city of Iquitos, Peru. We used similar
	to 2.3 million GPS data-points to quantify age-specific mobility
	parameters and dynamic co-location networks among all tracked
	individuals. Geographic space significantly affected human mobility,
	giving rise to highly local mobility kernels. Most (similar to 80\%)
	movements occurred within 1 km of an individual's home. Potential hourly
	contacts among individuals were highly irregular and temporally
	unstructured. Only up to 38\% of the tracked participants showed a
	regular and predictable mobility routine, a sharp contrast to the
	situation in the developed world. As a case study, we quantified the
	impact of spatially and temporally unstructured routines on the dynamics
	of transmission of an influenza-like pathogen within an Iquitos
	neighborhood. Temporally unstructured daily routines (e.g., not
	dominated by a single location, such as a workplace, where an individual
	repeatedly spent significant amount of time) increased an epidemic's
	final size and effective reproduction number by 20\% in comparison to
	scenarios modeling temporally structured contacts. Our findings provide
	a mechanistic description of the basic rules that shape human mobility
	within a resource-poor urban center, and contribute to the understanding
	of the role of fine-scale patterns of individual movement and
	co-location in infectious disease dynamics. More generally, this study
	emphasizes the need for careful consideration of human social
	interactions when designing infectious disease mitigation strategies,
	particularly within resource-poor urban environments.},

	Abstract = {Cooperative behavior that increases the fitness of others at a cost to
	oneself can be promoted by natural selection only in the presence of an
	additional mechanism. One such mechanism is based on population
	structure, which can lead to clustering of cooperating agents. Recently,
	the focus has turned to complex dynamical population structures such as
	social networks, where the nodes represent individuals and links
	represent social relationships. We investigate how the dynamics of a
	social network can change the level of cooperation in the network.
	Individuals either update their strategies by imitating their partners
	or adjust their social ties. For the dynamics of the network structure,
	a random link is selected and breaks with a probability determined by
	the adjacent individuals. Once it is broken, a new one is established.
	This linking dynamics can be conveniently characterized by a Markov
	chain in the configuration space of an ever-changing network of
	interacting agents. Our model can be analytically solved provided the
	dynamics of links proceeds much faster than the dynamics of strategies.
	This leads to a simple rule for the evolution of cooperation: The more
	fragile links between cooperating players and non-cooperating players
	are (or the more robust links between cooperators are), the more likely
	cooperation prevails. Our approach may pave the way for analytically
	investigating coevolution of strategy and structure.},

	months and with as few as 55 words, children with language delay ( late

	folding-the network property of a cohesive group whose membership

	strong when overlapping groups are cognitively distant. Measuring social
	distance separately from cognitive distance and distinctiveness
	independently from critical acclaim, the authors test their hypothesis
	about structural folding and cognitive diversity by analyzing team
	reassembly for 12,422 video games and the career histories of 139,727
	video game developers. When combined with cognitive distance, structural
	folding channels and mobilizes a productive tension of rules, roles, and

	Abstract = {Network measures assume a census of a well-bounded population. This
	level of coverage is rarely achieved in practice, however, and we have
	only limited information on the robustness of network measures to
	incomplete coverage. This paper examines the effect of node-level
	missingness on 4 classes of network measures: centrality,
	centralization, topology and homophily across a diverse sample of 12
	empirical networks. We use a Monte Carlo simulation process to generate
	data with known levels of missingness and compare the resulting network
	scores to their known starting values. As with past studies (Borgatti et
	al., 2006; Kossinets, 2006), we find that measurement bias generally
	increases with more missing data. The exact rate and nature of this
	increase, however, varies systematically across network measures. For
	example, betweenness and Bonacich centralization are quite sensitive to
	missing data while closeness and in-degree are robust. Similarly, while
	the tau statistic and distance are difficult to capture with missing
	data, transitivity shows little bias even with very high levels of
	missingness. The results are also clearly dependent on the features of
	the network. Larger, more centralized networks are generally more robust
	to missing data, but this is especially true for centrality and
	centralization measures. More cohesive networks are robust to missing
	data when measuring topological features but not when measuring
	centralization. Overall, the results suggest that missing data may have
	quite large or quite small effects on network measurement, depending on
	the type of network and the question being posed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

	as centrally controlled organisations has been replaced by the notion of
	criminal networks. However, little use has been made of concepts and
	theories of social networks that have developed in other social

	between criminal groups that perform three types of transnational
	illegal activities: smuggling and large-scale heroine trading,
	trafficking in women, and trading stolen cars. Groups that operate in
	the large-scale heroin market tend to be close-knit, cohesive and
	ethnically homogenous. Groups active in the trafficking of women have a
	chain structure, while those that operate in the market for stolen cars
	are characterised by three clusters of offenders in a chain. Both groups
	are less cohesive than criminal groups in the large-scale heroin market.
	The differences in social organisation between the three types of
	illegal activities appear to be related to the legal and financial risks
	associated with the crimes in question, and thereby to the required

	behavior. We empirically address these problems using longitudinal data
	on academic performance, friendship, and advice seeking relations among
	students in a full-time graduate academic program. We specify stochastic
	agent-based models that permit estimation of the interdependent
	contribution of social selection and social influence to individual

	assimilate the average performance of their friends and of their
	advisors. At the same time, students attaining similar levels of
	academic performance are more likely to develop friendship and advice
	ties. Together, these results imply that processes of social influence
	and social selection are sub-components of a more general a

	behavior. We discuss possible points of contact between our findings and

	Abstract = {Twitter is now well established as the world's second most important
	social media platform, after Facebook. Its 140-character updates are
	designed for brief messaging, and its network structures are kept
	relatively flat and simple: messages from users are either public and
	visible to all (even to unregistered visitors using the Twitter
	website), or private and visible only to approved `followers' of the
	sender; there are no more complex definitions of degrees of connection
	(family, friends, friends of friends) as they are available in other
	social networks. Over time, Twitter users have developed simple, but
	effective mechanisms for working around these limitations: `\#hashtags',
	which enable the manual or automatic collation of all tweets containing
	the same \#hashtag, as well allowing users to subscribe to content feeds
	that contain only those tweets which feature specific \#hashtags; and
	`@replies', which allow senders to direct public messages even to users
	whom they do not already follow. This paper documents a methodology for
	extracting public Twitter activity data around specific \#hashtags, and
	for processing these data in order to analyse and visualize the @reply
	networks existing between participating users - both overall, as a
	static network, and over time, to highlight the dynamic structure of
	@reply conversations. Such visualizations enable us to highlight the
	shifting roles played by individual participants, as well as the
	response of the overall \#hashtag community to new stimuli - such as the
	entry of new participants or the availability of new information. Over
	longer timeframes, it is also possible to identify different phases in
	the overall discussion, or the formation of distinct clusters of
	preferentially interacting participants.},

	subclass of `linkage moves' maintains the network structure, and so
	removing these links has a dramatic effect on the number of potentially
	infected farms, an effect corroborated by simulations. In contrast,
	because scrapie has a low probability of transmission per contact and a
	long incubation period, a static network representation is probably
	appropriate; however, the signature of the network in the pattern of
	transmission is likely to be faint. Scrapie-notifying farms were more
	likely to be associated with each other via trading at markets than were
	control farms; however, network community structure proves to be less
	representative of prevalence patterns than geographical region. These
	contradictory indicators emphasize that appropriate observation time
	frames and good discrimination among types of potentially infectious
	contacts are vital in order for network analysis to be a valuable
	epidemiological tool.},

	Abstract = {Nowadays users get informed and shape their opinion through social
	media. However, the disintermediated access to contents does not
	guarantee quality of information. Selective exposure and confirmation
	bias, indeed, have been shown to play a pivotal role in content
	consumption and information spreading. Users tend to select information
	adhering (and reinforcing) their worldview and to ignore dissenting
	information. This pattern elicits the formation of polarized groups -
	i.e., echo chambers where the interaction with like-minded people might
	even reinforce polarization. In this work we address news consumption
	around Brexit in UK on Facebook. In particular, we perform a massive
	analysis on more than I million users interacting with Brexit related
	posts from the main news providers between January and July 2016. We
	show that consumption patterns elicit the emergence of two distinct
	communities of news outlets. Furthermore, to better characterize inner
	group dynamics, we introduce a new technique which combines automatic
	topic extraction and sentiment analysis. We compare how the same topics
	are presented on posts and the related emotional response on comments
	finding significant differences in both echo chambers and that
	polarization influences the perception of topics. Our results provide
	important insights about the determinants of polarization and evolution

	some access-related divides do not vary by age or even decrease with
	age. For SNS adoption, we found that access to technological resources

	this conspiracy theory propagated on Twitter and whether the hashtag
	virality was aided by the use of automation or coordination among
	Twitter users. We found that while much of the content came from users

	article brings together sensemaking and social network theories to offer
	a theoretical account of schools' management of choice in an era of

	sensemaking about the accountability and choice systems occurred within
	the interorganizational networks in which they were embedded and was
	strongly conditioned by their own professional biographies and
	worldviews. Principals' networks offered access to resources that could
	be activated to make sense of the accountability and choice systems. How
	principals perceived accountability and choice policies influenced
	whether they activated their social networks for assistance in
	strategically managing the choice process, as well as how they made
	sense of advice available to them through these networks. Once
	activated, principals' networks provided uneven access to instrumental
	and expressive resources. Taken together, these results suggest that
	schools respond to accountability and choice plans in varied ways that
	are not simply a function of their short-term incentives.},

	of navigating such groups are thought to have significantly influenced
	human brain evolution(2). Yet little is known about how and to what

	Abstract = {Online social networks play a major role in modern societies, and they
	have shaped the way social relationships evolve. Link prediction in
	social networks has many potential applications such as recommending new
	items to users, friendship suggestion and discovering spurious
	connections. Many real social networks evolve the connections in
	multiple layers (e.g. multiple social networking platforms). In this
	article, we study the link prediction problem in multiplex networks. As
	an example, we consider a multiplex network of Twitter (as a
	microblogging service) and Foursquare (as a location-based social
	network). We consider social networks of the same users in these two
	platforms and develop a meta-path-based algorithm for predicting the
	links. The connectivity information of the two layers is used to predict
	the links in Foursquare network. Three classical classifiers (naive
	Bayes, support vector machines (SVM) and K-nearest neighbour) are used
	for the classification task. Although the networks are not highly
	correlated in the layers, our experiments show that including the
	cross-layer information significantly improves the prediction
	performance. The SVM classifier results in the best performance with an
	average accuracy of 89\%.},

	spatio-temporal datasets that describe timestamped occurrences of

	activity and links are drawn between individuals based on their
	co-occurrences across these `gathering events'. The statistical
	significance of these connections is then tested against an appropriate
	null model. Such a framework allows us to exploit the wealth of
	analytical and computational tools of network analysis in settings where
	the underlying connectivity pattern between interacting agents (commonly
	termed the adjacency matrix) is not given a priori. We perform
	experiments on two large-scale datasets (greater than 10(6) points) of
	great tit Parus major wild bird foraging records and illustrate the use
	of this approach by examining the temporal dynamics of pairing
	behaviour, a process that was previously very hard to observe. We show
	that established pair bonds are maintained continuously, whereas new
	pair bonds form at variable times before breeding, but are characterized
	by a rapid development of network proximity. The method proposed here is
	general, and can be applied to any system with information about the
	temporal co-occurrence of interacting agents.},

	Abstract = {It is well known that humans tend to associate with other humans who

	Although geneticists have shown that populations tend to stratify
	genetically, this process results from geographic sorting or assortative
	mating, and it is unknown whether genotypes may be correlated as a
	consequence of nonreproductive associations or other processes. Here, we
	study six available genotypes from the National Longitudinal Study of
	Adolescent Health to test for genetic similarity between friends. Maps
	of the friendship networks show clustering of genotypes and, after we
	apply strict controls for population stratification, the results show
	that one genotype is positively correlated (homophily) and one genotype
	is negatively correlated (heterophily). A replication study in an
	independent sample from the Framingham Heart Study verifies that DRD2
	exhibits significant homophily and that CYP2A6 exhibits significant
	heterophily. These unique results show that homophily and heterophily
	obtain on a genetic (indeed, an allelic) level, which has implications
	for the study of population genetics and social behavior. In particular,
	the results suggest that association tests should include friends' genes
	and that theories of evolution should take into account the fact that
	humans might, in some sense, be metagenomic with respect to the humans

	Abstract = {Centrality measures such as the degree, k-shell, or eigenvalue
	centrality can identify a network's most influential nodes, but are
	rarely usefully accurate in quantifying the spreading power of the vast
	majority of nodes which are not highly influential. The spreading power
	of all network nodes is better explained by considering, from a
	continuous-time epidemiological perspective, the distribution of the
	force of infection each node generates. The resulting metric, the
	expected force, accurately quantifies node spreading power under all
	primary epidemiological models across a wide range of archetypical human
	contact networks. When node power is low, influence is a function of
	neighbor degree. As power increases, a node's own degree becomes more
	important. The strength of this relationship is modulated by network
	structure, being more pronounced in narrow, dense networks typical of
	social networking and weakening in broader, looser association networks
	such as the Internet. The expected force can be computed independently
	for individual nodes, making it applicable for networks whose adjacency
	matrix is dynamic, not well specified, or overwhelmingly large.},

	individuals' attributes, and identify patterns known as temporal motifs.
	We then construct a null model for the occurrence of temporal motifs
	that takes into account the interaction frequencies and connectivity

	find sex-related differences in communication patterns in a large

	communication patterns beyond what would be expected on the basis of
	their average interaction frequencies. We also show that temporal

	Abstract = {Bridges that span structural holes are often explained in terms of the
	entrepreneurial personalities or rational motivations of brokers, or
	structural processes that lead to the intersection of social foci. I
	argue that the existence and use of bridges in interpersonal networks
	also depends on individuals' health. Poor health may make it more
	difficult to withstand the pressures and to execute some of the common
	tasks associated with bridging(e.g., brokerage). I examine this
	possibility using egocentric network data on over 2500 older adults
	drawn from the recent National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
	(NSHAP). Multivariate regression analyses show that both cognitive and
	functional health are significantly positively associated with bridging,
	net of sociodemographic and life-course controls. The relationship
	between functional (kinesthetic) health and bridging appears to be
	partially mediated by network composition, as older adults who have
	poorer functional health also tend to have networks that are richer in
	strong ties. Several potential mediation mechanisms are discussed.
	Cognitive function remains significantly associated with bridging net of
	network composition, Suggesting that the inherent challenges of
	maintaining bridging positions may be more difficult to cope with for
	those who have cognitive impairments than for those who have functional
	impairments such as limited mobility. An alternative explanation is that
	cognitively impaired individuals have more difficulty recognizing (and
	thus strategically using) bridges in their networks. Theoretical
	implications and possibilities for future research are discussed. (c)

	Abstract = {Academic success of students has been explained with a variety of
	individual and socioeconomic factors. Social networks that informally
	emerge within student communities can have an additional effect on their
	achievement. However, this effect of social ties is difficult to measure
	and quantify, because social networks are multidimensional and
	dynamically evolving within the educational context. We repeatedly
	surveyed a cohort of 226 engineering undergraduates between their first
	day at university and a crucial examination at the end of the academic
	year. We investigate how social networks emerge between previously
	unacquainted students and how integration in these networks explains
	academic success. Our study measures multiple important dimensions of
	social ties between students: their positive interactions, friendships,
	and studying relations. By using statistical models for dynamic network
	data, we are able to investigate the processes of social network
	formation in the cohort. We find that friendship ties informally evolve
	into studying relationships over the academic year. This process is
	crucial, as studying together with others, in turn, has a strong impact
	on students' success at the examination. The results are robust to
	individual differences in socioeconomic background factors and to
	various indirect measures of cognitive abilities, such as prior academic
	achievement and being perceived as smart by other students. The findings
	underline the importance of understanding social network dynamics in
	educational settings. They call for the creation of university
	environments promoting the development of positive relationships in

	who have limited mobility. Once older adults start using digital media,

	that cannot be dismissed as token. Older adults especially used and
	valued digital media for companionship. They also used them for
	coordination, maintaining ties, and casual conversations. Email was used
	more with friends than relatives; some Skype was used with close family

	affect gender disadvantages in career advancement. Focusing on a

	study argues that women suffer a ``closure penalty{''} and face severe
	career disadvantages when collaborating in cohesive teams. At the same
	time, gender disadvantages are reduced for women who build social
	capital in open networks with higher degrees of diversity and
	information flow. Using large-scale longitudinal data on career profiles
	of about one million performances by 97,657 film actors in 369,099 film
	productions between the years 1929 and 2010, I analyze career survival
	models and interaction effects between gender and different measures of
	social capital and information openness. Findings reveal that female
	actors have a higher risk of career failure than do their male
	colleagues when affiliated in cohesive networks, but women have better
	survival chances when embedded in open, diverse structures. This study
	contributes to the understanding of how and what type of social capital

	characterization and comparison of network-level social structures
	across multiple settings, such as different organizations, communities,
	or social groups, and to the examination of sources of variability in
	network structure. we first fit a p{*} model (Wasserman and Pattison
	1996) to each network to obtain estimates for effects of six structural
	properties on the probability of the graph. We then calculate predicted
	tie probabilities for each network, using both its own parameter
	estimates and the estimates from every other network in the collection.
	Comparison is based on the similarity between sets of predicted tie
	probabilities. We then use correspondence analysis to represent the
	similarities among all 42 net-works and interpret the resulting
	configuration using information about the species and relations
	involved. Results show that similarities among the networks are due more
	to the kind of relation than to the kind of animal.},

	also that the hourly frequency of morally relevant tweets predicted the

	in which the addition of new links is dependent on the (typically local)
	network structure (network evolution models, NEMs), and those in which
	links are generated based only on nodal attributes (nodal attribute
	models, NAMs). An exponential random graph model (ERGM) with structural
	dependencies is included for comparison. We fit models from each of
	these categories to two empirical acquaintance networks with respect to
	basic network properties. We compare higher order structures in the
	resulting networks with those in the data, with the aim of determining
	which models produce the most realistic network structure with respect
	to degree distributions, assortativity, clustering spectra, geodesic
	path distributions, and community structure (subgroups with dense
	internal connections). We find that the nodal attribute models
	successfully produce assortative networks and very clear community
	structure. However, they generate unrealistic clustering spectra and
	peaked degree distributions that do not match empirical data on large
	social networks. On the other hand, many of the network evolution models
	produce degree distributions and clustering spectra that agree more
	closely with data. They also generate assortative networks and community
	structure, although often not to the same extent as in the data. The
	ERGM model, which turned out to be near-degenerate in the parameter
	region best fitting our data, produces the weakest community structure.

	Abstract = {Homophily can put minority groups at a disadvantage by restricting their
	ability to establish links with a majority group or to access novel
	information. Here, we show how this phenomenon can influence the ranking
	of minorities in examples of real-world networks with various levels of
	heterophily and homophily ranging from sexual contacts, dating contacts,
	scientific collaborations, and scientific citations. We devise a social
	network model with tunable homophily and group sizes, and demonstrate
	how the degree ranking of nodes from the minority group in a network is
	a function of (i) relative group sizes and (ii) the presence or absence
	of homophilic behaviour. We provide analytical insights on how the
	ranking of the minority can be improved to ensure the representativeness
	of the group and correct for potential biases. Our work presents a
	foundation for assessing the impact of homophilic and heterophilic
	behaviour on minorities in social networks.},

	Abstract = {Biologists have devoted much attention to assortative mating or
	homogamy, the tendency for sexual species tomate with similar others. In
	contrast, there has been little theoretical work on the broader
	phenomenon of homophily, the tendency for individuals to interact with
	similar others. Yet this behaviour is also widely observed in nature.
	Here, we model how natural selection can give rise to homophily when
	individuals engage in social interaction in a population with multiple
	observable phenotypes. Payoffs to interactions depend on whether or not
	individuals have the same or different phenotypes, and each individual
	has a preference that determines how likely they are to interact with
	others of their own phenotype (homophily) or of opposite phenotypes
	(heterophily). The results show that homophily tends to evolve under a
	wide variety of conditions, helping to explain its ubiquity in nature.},

	Abstract = {Research on measurement error in network data has typically focused on
	missing data. We embed missing data, which we term false negative nodes
	and edges, in a broader classification of error scenarios. This includes
	false positive nodes and edges and falsely aggregated and disaggregated
	nodes. We simulate these six measurement errors using an online social
	network and a publication citation network, reporting their effects on
	four node-level measures - degree centrality, clustering coefficient,
	network constraint, and eigenvector centrality. Our results suggest that
	in networks with more positively-skewed degree distributions and higher
	average clustering, these measures tend to be less resistant to most
	forms of measurement error. In addition, we argue that the sensitivity
	of a given measure to an error scenario depends on the idiosyncracies of
	the measure's calculation, thus revising the general claim from past
	research that the more `global' a measure, the less resistant it is to
	measurement error. Finally, we anchor our discussion to commonly-used
	networks in past research that suffer from these different forms of
	measurement error and make recommendations for correction strategies.

	highly connected individuals. Numbers of ant encounters observed
	positively correlated with the duration of observation. Individuals
	varied in interaction frequency, even after accounting for the duration

	shape and location within the entrance chamber. Computer simulations
	demonstrate that variation among individuals in connectivity accelerates
	information flow to an extent equivalent to an increase in the total

	However, critical mass theory requires an explanation of how a critical

	that solves this problem by showing how aspects of social structure -

	Abstract = {Background: The analysis of co-authorship network aims at exploring the
	impact of network structure on the outcome of scientific collaborations
	and research publications. However, little is known about what network
	properties are associated with authors who have increased number of
	joint publications and are being cited highly.
	Methodology/Principal Findings: Measures of social network analysis, for
	example network centrality and tie strength, have been utilized
	extensively in current co-authorship literature to explore different
	behavioural patterns of co-authorship networks. Using three SNA measures
	(i.e., degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness
	centrality), we explore scientific collaboration networks to understand
	factors influencing performance (i.e., citation count) and formation
	(tie strength between authors) of such networks. A citation count is the
	number of times an article is cited by other articles. We use
	co-authorship dataset of the research field of `steel structure' for the
	year 2005 to 2009. To measure the strength of scientific collaboration
	between two authors, we consider the number of articles co-authored by
	them. In this study, we examine how citation count of a scientific
	publication is influenced by different centrality measures of its
	co-author(s) in a co-authorship network. We further analyze the impact
	of the network positions of authors on the strength of their scientific
	collaborations. We use both correlation and regression methods for data
	analysis leading to statistical validation. We identify that citation
	count of a research article is positively correlated with the degree
	centrality and betweenness centrality values of its co-author(s). Also,
	we reveal that degree centrality and betweenness centrality values of
	authors in a co-authorship network are positively correlated with the
	strength of their scientific collaborations.
	Conclusions/Significance: Authors' network positions in co-authorship
	networks influence the performance (i.e., citation count) and formation

	Abstract = {Geographic proximity is a determinant factor of friendship. Friendship
	datasets that include detailed geographic information are scarce, and
	when this information is available, the dependence of friendship on
	distance is often modelled by pre-specified parametric functions or
	derived from theory without further empirical assessment. This paper
	aims to give a detailed representation of the association between
	distance and the likelihood of friendship existence and friendship
	dynamics, and how this is modified by a few basic social and individual
	factors. The data employed is a three-wave network of 336 adolescents
	living in a small Swedish town, for whom information has been collected
	on their household locations. The analysis is a three-step process that
	combines (1) nonparametric logistic regressions to unravel the overall
	functional form of the dependence of friendship on distance, without
	assuming it has a particular strength or shape; (2) parametric logistic
	regressions to construct suitable transformations of distance that can
	be employed in (3) stochastic models for longitudinal network data, to
	assess how distance, individual covariates, and network structure shape
	adolescent friendship dynamics. It was found that the log-odds of
	friendship existence and friendship dynamics decrease smoothly with the
	logarithm of distance. For adolescents in different schools the
	dependence is linear, and stronger than for adolescents in the same
	school. Living nearby accounts, in this dataset, for an aspect of
	friendship dynamics that is not explicitly modelled by network structure
	or by individual covariates. In particular, the estimated distance
	effect is not correlated with reciprocity or transitivity effects. (C)

	Abstract = {Missing data is an important, but often ignored, aspect of a network
	study. Measurement validity is affected by missing data, but the level
	of bias can be difficult to gauge. Here, we describe the effect of
	missing data on network measurement across widely different
	circumstances. In Part I of this study (Smith and Moody, 2013), we
	explored the effect of measurement bias due to randomly missing nodes.
	Here, we drop the assumption that data are missing at random: what
	happens to estimates of key network statistics when central nodes are
	more/less likely to be missing? We answer this question using a wide
	range of empirical networks and network measures. We find that bias is
	worse when more central nodes are missing. With respect to network
	measures, Bonacich centrality is highly sensitive to the loss of central
	nodes, while closeness centrality is not; distance and bicomponent size
	are more affected than triad summary measures and behavioral homophily
	is more robust than degree-homophily. With respect to types of networks,
	larger, directed networks tend to be more robust, but the relation is
	weak. We end the paper with a practical application, showing how
	researchers can use our results (translated into a publically available
	java application) to gauge the bias in their own data. (C) 2016 Elsevier

	Abstract = {Recent studies suggest that obesity may be ``contagious{''} between
	individuals in social networks. Social contagion (influence), however,
	may not be identifiable using traditional statistical approaches because
	they cannot distinguish contagion from homophily (the propensity for
	individuals to select friends who are similar to themselves) or from
	shared environmental influences. In this paper, we apply the stochastic
	actor-based model (SABM) framework developed by Snijders and colleagues
	to data on adolescent body mass index (BMI), screen time, and playing
	active sports. Our primary hypothesis was that social influences on
	adolescent body size and related behaviors are independent of friend
	selection. Employing the SABM, we simultaneously modeled network
	dynamics (friendship selection based on homophily and structural
	characteristics of the network) and social influence. We focused on the
	2 largest schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
	Health (Add Health) and held the school environment constant by
	examining the 2 school networks separately (N = 624 and 1151). Results
	show support in both schools for homophily on BMI, but also for social
	influence on BMI. There was no evidence of homophily on screen time in
	either school, while only one of the schools showed homophily on playing
	active sports. There was, however, evidence of social influence on
	screen time in one of the schools, and playing active sports in both
	schools. These results suggest that both homophily and social influence
	are important in understanding patterns of adolescent obesity.
	Intervention efforts should take into consideration peers' influence on
	one another, rather than treating ``high risk{''} adolescents in
	isolation.},

	public as a result of motivated reasoning, where people misconstrue data
	to fit their political and psychological biases. In the case of climate
	change, some people have been found to systematically misinterpret
	climate data in ways that conflict with the intended message of climate
	scientists. While prior studies have attempted to reduce motivated
	reasoning through bipartisan communication networks, these networks have
	also been found to exacerbate bias. Popular theories hold that
	bipartisan networks amplify bias by exposing people to opposing beliefs.
	These theories are in tension with collective intelligence research,
	which shows that exchanging beliefs in social networks can facilitate
	social learning, thereby improving individual and group judgments.
	However, prior experiments in collective intelligence have relied almost
	exclusively on neutral questions that do not engage motivated reasoning.
	Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we conducted an online experiment to
	test how bipartisan social networks can influence subjects'
	interpretation of climate communications from NASA. Here, we show that
	exposure to opposing beliefs in structured bipartisan social networks
	substantially improved the accuracy of judgments among both
	conservatives and liberals, eliminating belief polarization. However, we
	also find that social learning can be reduced, and belief polarization
	maintained, as a result of partisan priming. We find that increasing the
	salience of partisanship during communication, both through exposure to
	the logos of political parties and through exposure to the political
	identities of network peers, can significantly reduce social learning.},

	Individuals exert ``contagion effects'' on one another through social

	the possibility that homophily from unmeasured factors may explain these
	statistical associations and because similar findings can be obtained
	when the same methodology is applied to height, acne, and headaches, for
	which the conclusion of contagion effects seems somewhat less plausible.
	The author uses sensitivity analysis techniques to assess the extent to
	which supposed contagion effects for obesity, smoking, happiness, and

	extent to which the critique using analysis of data on height, acne, and
	headaches is relevant. Sensitivity analyses suggest that contagion
	effects for obesity and smoking cessation are reasonably robust to
	possible latent homophily or environmental confounding; those for
	happiness and loneliness are somewhat less so. Supposed effects for
	height, acne, and headaches are all easily explained away by latent
	homophily and confounding. The methodology that has been used in past
	studies for contagion effects in social networks, when used in
	conjunction with sensitivity analysis, may prove useful in establishing
	social influence for various behaviors and states. The sensitivity

	Abstract = {Estimating the effects of interventions in networks is complicated due
	to interference, such that the outcomes for one experimental unit may
	depend on the treatment assignments of other units. Familiar statistical
	formalism, experimental designs, and analysis methods assume the absence
	of this interference, and result in biased estimates of causal effects
	when it exists. While some assumptions can lead to unbiased estimates,
	these assumptions are generally unrealistic in the context of a network
	and often amount to assuming away the interference. In this work, we
	evaluate methods for designing and analyzing randomized experiments
	under minimal, realistic assumptions compatible with broad interference,
	where the aim is to reduce bias and possibly overall error in estimates
	of average effects of a global treatment. In design, we consider the
	ability to perform random assignment to treatments that is correlated in
	the network, such as through graph cluster randomization. In analysis,
	we consider incorporating information about the treatment assignment of
	network neighbors. We prove sufficient conditions for bias reduction
	through both design and analysis in the presence of potentially global
	interference; these conditions also give lower bounds on treatment
	effects. Through simulations of the entire process of experimentation in
	networks, we measure the performance of these methods under varied
	network structure and varied social behaviors, finding substantial bias
	reductions and, despite a bias-variance tradeoff, error reductions.
	These improvements are largest for networks with more clustering and
	data generating processes with both stronger direct effects of the
	treatment and stronger interactions between units.},

	the case of the Occupy movement, the success of recruiting over 400,000
	users to Facebook was driven by user-created content produced in a
	medium that encourages contributions and sharing to an existing set of
	dense networks of potential movement sympathizers. We find that the
	posts that are most successful at recruiting active Facebook engagement
	utilize existing forms of communication, such as sharing pictures and
	status updates. We also find that posts that use confrontational
	messages and messages about solidarity appear most often in the top
	posts. Our findings suggest that online social networking tools such as
	Facebook and Twitter provide a powerful tool for movements to rapidly
	spread information and reach broad audiences. In addition, we offer some
	analysis of the impact of these findings for social movements that hope
	to utilize Facebook.},

	explain why certain activists continue to be involved in social
	movements while others withdraw. When activists remain embedded in
	social networks relevant for the protest issues and, above all, when
	they keep a symbolic linkage between their activism and their personal
	life-spheres, sustained participation is likely to occur. When these two
	factors become progressively separated from each other and the process
	of self-interaction by activists loses its strength, disengagement can
	be expected. The argument is illustrated with life-history interviews of
	activists who have kept their strong commitment to a major organization
	of the Swiss solidarity movement, and others that, in contrast, have
	abandoned their involvement. The findings support the argument that the
	interplay of the structural positions of actors and the symbolic
	meanings of mobilization has a strong impact on commitment to social
	movements and hence on sustained participation or disengagement. In
	particular, the interviews show the importance of a sense of coherence
	and of a holistic view of one's personal life for keeping commitment
	over time. This calls for a view of individual participation in social
	movements that draws from social phenomenology and symbolic
	interactionism in order to shed light on the symbolic (subjective)

	social relationships influence access to off-farm seed for a major crop.
	Seed shortfalls are common, and farmer-farmer exchange is important for
	providing locally-adapted seed to fill this gap, but access varies
	considerably among households, also affecting quantities supplied and
	terms of exchange. Preferred sources for off-farm seed (neighbors,
	government, market) also vary among farmers, reflecting agroecology and
	asset-ownership, but also differing access to these sources. Social
	network theories highlight the importance of reciprocal ties, and the
	cultural norms underpinning them, in accessing seed. These cultural
	norms are contested, with some claiming that commercial transactions are
	increasingly common. Implications for interventions supporting farmer
	seed systems, particularly emergency seed aid, are discussed in relation
	to the socially-mediated nature of seed access.},

	Abstract = {Human social interactions in local settings can be experimentally
	detected by recording the physical proximity and orientation of people.
	Such interactions, approximating face-to-face communications, can be
	effectively represented as time varying social networks with links being
	unceasingly created and destroyed over time. Traditional analyses of
	temporal networks have addressed mostly pairwise interactions, where
	links describe dyadic connections among individuals. However, many
	network dynamics are hardly ascribable to pairwise settings but often
	comprise larger groups, which are better described by higher-order
	interactions. Here we investigate the higher-order organizations of
	temporal social networks by analyzing five publicly available datasets
	collected in different social settings. We find that higher-order
	interactions are ubiquitous and, similarly to their pairwise
	counterparts, characterized by heterogeneous dynamics, with bursty
	trains of rapidly recurring higher-order events separated by long
	periods of inactivity. We investigate the evolution and formation of
	groups by looking at the transition rates between different higher-order
	structures. We find that in more spontaneous social settings, group are
	characterized by slower formation and disaggregation, while in work
	settings these phenomena are more abrupt, possibly reflecting
	pre-organized social dynamics. Finally, we observe temporal
	reinforcement suggesting that the longer a group stays together the
	higher the probability that the same interaction pattern persist in the
	future. Our findings suggest the importance of considering the
	higher-order structure of social interactions when investigating human
	temporal dynamics.},

	Abstract = {The level of antagonism between political groups has risen in the past
	years. Supporters of a given party increasingly dislike members of the
	opposing group and avoid intergroup interactions, leading to homophilic
	social networks. While new connections offline are driven largely by
	human decisions, new connections on online social platforms are
	intermediated by link recommendation algorithms, e.g., ``People you may
	know{''} or ``Whom to follow{''} suggestions. The long-term impacts of
	link recommendation in polarization are unclear, particularly as
	exposure to opposing viewpoints has a dual effect: Connections with
	out-group members can lead to opinion convergence and prevent group
	polarization or further separate opinions. Here, we provide a complex
	adaptive-systems perspective on the effects of link recommendation
	algorithms. While several models justify polarization through rewiring
	based on opinion similarity, here we explain it through rewiring
	grounded in structural similarity-defined as similarity based on network
	properties. We observe that preferentially establishing links with
	structurally similar nodes (i.e., sharing many neighbors) results in
	network topologies that are amenable to opinion polarization. Hence,
	polarization occurs not because of a desire to shield oneself from
	disagreeable attitudes but, instead, due to the creation of inadvertent
	echo chambers. When networks are composed of nodes that react
	differently to out-group contacts, either converging or polarizing, we
	find that connecting structurally dissimilar nodes moderates opinions.
	Overall, our study sheds light on the impacts of social-network
	algorithms and unveils avenues to steer dynamics of radicalization and
	polarization in online social networks.},

	Abstract = {Social media are massive marketplaces where ideas and news compete for
	our attention(1). Previous studies have shown that quality is not a
	necessary condition for online virality(2) and that knowledge about peer
	choices can distort the relationship between quality and popularity(3).
	However, these results do not explain the viral spread of low-quality
	information, such as the digital misinformation that threatens our
	democracy(4). We investigate quality discrimination in a stylized model
	of an online social network, where individual agents prefer quality
	information, but have behavioural limitations in managing a heavy flow
	of information. We measure the relationship between the quality of an
	idea and its likelihood of becoming prevalent at the system level. We
	find that both information overload and limited attention contribute to
	a degradation of the market's discriminative power. A good tradeoff
	between discriminative power and diversity of information is possible
	according to the model. However, calibration with empirical data
	characterizing information load and finite attention in real social
	media reveals a weak correlation between quality and popularity of
	information. In these realistic conditions, the model predicts that
	low-quality information is just as likely to go viral, providing an
	interpretation for the high volume of misinformation we observe online.},

	The results show that large online networks are more strongly segregated

	that core networks are more segregated in terms of ethnicity and gender
	than are extended networks. However, an exception to this pattern is
	personal networks of ethnic majority members, whose core networks are as
	segregated by ethnicity as their extended networks. Further analysis
	suggests this exception is due to their larger population size and the

	Abstract = {Community structure is one of the most commonly observed features of
	Online Social Networks (OSNs) in reality. The knowledge of this feature
	is of great advantage: it not only provides helpful insights into
	developing more efficient social-aware solutions but also promises a
	wide range of applications enabled by social and mobile networking, such
	as routing strategies in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) and worm
	containment in OSNs. Unfortunately, understanding this structure is very
	challenging, especially in dynamic social networks where social
	interactions are evolving rapidly. Our work focuses on the following
	questions: How can we efficiently identify communities in dynamic social
	networks? How can we adaptively update the network community structure
	based on its history instead of recomputing from scratch? To this end,
	we present Quick Community Adaptation (QCA), an adaptive
	modularity-based framework for not only discovering but also tracing the
	evolution of network communities in dynamic OSNs. QCA is very fast and
	efficient in the sense that it adaptively updates and discovers the new
	community structure based on its history together with the network
	changes only. This flexible approach makes QCA an ideal framework
	applicable for analyzing large-scale dynamic social networks due to its
	lightweight computing-resource requirement. To illustrate the
	effectiveness of our framework, we extensively test QCA on both
	synthesized and real-world social networks including Enron, arXiv
	e-print citation, and Facebook networks. Finally, we demonstrate the
	applicability of QCA in real applications: (1) A social-aware message
	forwarding strategy in MANETs, and (2) worm propagation containment in
	OSNs. Competitive results in comparison with other methods reveal that
	social-based techniques employing QCA as a community detection core
	outperform current available methods.},

	Abstract = {Modifiable health behaviors, a leading cause of illness and death in

	about health and disease. Individual behaviors affecting health outcomes
	are increasingly modulated by social networks, for example through the

	influence effects. Using a statistical approach to measure the
	individual temporal effects of a large number of variables pertaining to
	social network statistics, we investigate the spread of a health
	sentiment towards a new vaccine on Twitter, a large online social
	network. We find that the effects of neighborhood size and exposure
	intensity are qualitatively very different depending on the type of
	sentiment. Generally, we find that larger numbers of opinionated
	neighbors inhibit the expression of sentiments. We also find that
	exposure to negative sentiment is contagious - by which we merely mean
	predictive of future negative sentiment expression - while exposure to
	positive sentiments is generally not. In fact, exposure to positive
	sentiments can even predict increased negative sentiment expression. Our
	results suggest that the effects of peer influence and social contagion
	on the dynamics of behavioral spread on social networks are strongly

	Abstract = {Objective: Many Internet users seek health information through online
	health communities (OHCs) and other social media. Yet few studies assess
	how individuals use peer-generated health information, and many
	healthcare providers (HCPs) believe OHCs interfere with patient-provider
	relationships. This study explored how individuals use OHC content in
	clinical discussions and how HCPs react to it.
	Methods: We conducted in-person and virtual focus groups with
	patients/caregivers who visited OHCs (n = 89). A trained moderator asked
	about reasons for membership, sharing OHC content with providers, HCP
	reactions, and preferred roles for HCPs. Two researchers independently
	coded verbatim transcripts (NVivo 9.2) and conducted thematic response
	analysis.
	Results: Participants described OHCs as supplementing information from
	HCPs, whom they perceived as too busy for detailed discussions. Almost
	all participants shared OHC content with HCPs, although only half cited
	OHCs as the source. Most HCPs reacted negatively to OHC content, making
	participants feel disempowered. Despite these reactions, participants
	continued to use OHCs, and most desired HCP feedback on the accuracy of
	OHC content.
	Conclusions: Individuals do not use OHCs to circumvent HCPs but instead
	to gather more in-depth information.
	Practice implications: HCPs should discuss OHC content with patients to
	help them avoid misinformation and make more informed decisions. (C)

	Number = {4},
	Month = {APR 7},
	Abstract = {Background: Living systems are associated with Social networks -
	networks made up of nodes, some of which may be more important in
	various aspects as compared to others. While different quantitative
	measures labeled as ``centralities'' have previously been used in the
	network analysis community to find out influential nodes in a network,
	it is debatable how valid the centrality measures actually are. In other
	words, the research question that remains unanswered is: how exactly do
	these measures perform in the real world? So, as an example, if a
	centrality of a particular node identifies it to be important, is the
	node actually important?
	Purpose: The goal of this paper is not just to perform a traditional
	social network analysis but rather to evaluate different centrality
	measures by conducting an empirical study analyzing exactly how do
	network centralities correlate with data from published
	multidisciplinary network data sets.
	Method: We take standard published network data sets while using a
	random network to establish a baseline. These data sets included the
	Zachary's Karate Club network, dolphin social network and a neural
	network of nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Each of the data sets was
	analyzed in terms of different centrality measures and compared with
	existing knowledge from associated published articles to review the role
	of each centrality measure in the determination of influential nodes.
	Results: Our empirical analysis demonstrates that in the chosen network
	data sets, nodes which had a high Closeness Centrality also had a high
	Eccentricity Centrality. Likewise high Degree Centrality also correlated
	closely with a high Eigenvector Centrality. Whereas Betweenness
	Centrality varied according to network topology and did not demonstrate
	any noticeable pattern. In terms of identification of key nodes, we
	discovered that as compared with other centrality measures, Eigenvector
	and Eccentricity Centralities were better able to identify important
	nodes.},

	this, we applied a machine vision system to track the position and

	explore the role of ecological context within the study of the digital

	efficacy. Social cohesion, and an expectation for informal social
	control at the neighborhood level, is a function of both ecological
	context and media context. Those embedded within settings where prior

	overcome contextual barriers to collective action, namely within areas
	of concentrated disadvantage; may now, as a result of local Internet
	use, experience reduced social and civic inequality. This article is
	based on the results of a 3-year naturalistic experiment that examined
	the use of the Internet for communication at the neighborhood level. It
	proposes a new measure of collective efficacy-in place of network
	measures or perceived cohesion-based on the direct observation of
	communication practices. The analysis includes a model of the ecological
	characteristics associated with neighborhoods that adopted the Internet
	as a means of local information exchange, and it provides a comparison
	of the content of electronic messages exchanged within areas of
	advantage and those of extreme poverty, unemployment, and racial
	segregation. Findings suggest that as much as the Internet supports
	social and civic engagement in areas where it is already likely to be

	Abstract = {Network homophily is a pattern in which ties are more likely to exist
	between nodes similar to each other. It is frequently observed for
	various types of social relations. At the same time, segregation is
	often encountered in urban areas as a tendency of families to occupy
	neighborhoods inhabited by other families similar to them. In this paper
	we conceptualize both phenomena as in the language of networks of
	interlinked positions occupied by a population of actors characterized
	by some node-level attribute. We review existing indexes and approaches
	to measuring the extent of homophily/segregation in social networks. We
	pursue an approach of, first, specifying a set of properties that a
	generic segregation measure might possess, and which, in our view, are
	relevant in substantial contexts. Second, we check which measures
	satisfy which properties. The use of measures is illustrated with four
	empirical examples. Given the particular application and the need for
	some descriptive measure of segregation, the results presented in this
	paper can help in selecting an optimal measure for the task at hand. We
	conclude that the most crucial aspects for the choice of a particular
	segregation measure include (1) whether the network ties or actors'
	attributes are assumed to be subject to change, and (2) how one should
	treat the presence of network isolates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

	Abstract = {Frequently, social networks are studied in their own right with analyses
	devoid of contextual details. Yet contextual features - both social and
	spatial - can have impacts on the networks formed within them. This idea
	is explored with five empirical networks representing different contexts
	and the use of distinct modeling strategies. These strategies include
	network visualizations, QAP regression, exponential random graph models,
	blockmodeling and a combination of blockmodels with exponential random
	graph models within a single framework. We start with two empirical
	examples of networks inside organizations. The familiar Bank Wiring Room
	data show that the social organization (social context) and spatial
	arrangement of the room help account for the social relations formed
	there. The second example comes from a police academy where two designed
	arrangements, one social and one spatial, powerfully determine the
	relational social structures formed by recruits. The next example is an
	inter-organizational network that emerged as part of a response to a
	natural disaster where features of the improvised context helped account
	for the relations that formed between organizations participating in the
	search and rescue mission. We then consider an anthropological example
	of signed relations among sub-tribes in the New Guinea highlands where
	the physical geography is fixed. This is followed by a trading network
	off the Dalmatian coast where geography and physical conditions matter.
	Through these examples, we show that context matters by shaping the
	structure of networks that form and that a variety of network analytic
	tools can be mobilized to reveal how networks are shaped, in part, by
	social and spatial contexts. Implications for studying social networks
	are suggested. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	exchange beyond family at early ages. We also show that strong
	friendships are more important than family ties in predicting levels of

	long been recognized as an important factor in supporting cooperation.
	They also did not give subjects access to global social knowledge, or

	remained unknown how reputational and social knowledge foster

	complementing each other. In an experimental setting, we show that
	global reputational knowledge is crucial to sustaining a high level of
	cooperation and welfare. Cooperation is associated with the emergence of
	dense and clustered networks with highly cooperative hubs. Global social
	knowledge has no effect on the aggregate level of cooperation. A
	community analysis shows that the addition of global social knowledge to
	global reputational knowledge affects the distribution of cooperative
	activity: cooperators form a separate community that achieves a higher
	cooperation level than the community of defectors. Members of the

	Abstract = {Background: An important function of many complex networks is to inhibit
	or promote the transmission of disease, resources, or information
	between individuals. However, little is known about how the temporal
	dynamics of individual-level interactions affect these networks and
	constrain their function. Ant colonies are a model comparative system
	for understanding general principles linking individual-level
	interactions to network-level functions because interactions among
	individuals enable integration of multiple sources of information to
	collectively make decisions, and allocate tasks and resources.
	Methodology/Findings: Here we show how the temporal and spatial dynamics
	of such individual interactions provide upper bounds to rates of
	colony-level information flow in the ant Temnothorax rugatulus. We
	develop a general framework for analyzing dynamic networks and a
	mathematical model that predicts how information flow scales with
	individual mobility and group size.
	Conclusions/Significance: Using thousands of time-stamped interactions
	between uniquely marked ants in four colonies of a range of sizes, we
	demonstrate that observed maximum rates of information flow are always
	slower than predicted, and are constrained by regulation of individual
	mobility and contact rate. By accounting for the ordering and timing of
	interactions, we can resolve important difficulties with network
	sampling frequency and duration, enabling a broader understanding of

	chambers in information spreading phenomena over political communication
	networks. Mining 12 million Twitter messages, we reconstruct a network
	in which users interchange opinions related to the impeachment of the
	former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. We define a continuous

	that allows to quantify the presence of echo chambers in the strongly

	well-separated communities of similar sizes with opposite views of the
	impeachment process. By means of simple spreading models, we show that
	the capability of users in propagating the content they produce,
	measured by the associated spreading capacity, strongly depends on their
	attitude. Users expressing pro-impeachment leanings are capable to
	transmit information, on average, to a larger audience than users
	expressing anti-impeachment leanings. Furthermore, the users' spreading
	capacity is correlated to the diversity, in terms of political position,

	Abstract = {In this paper we revisit the concept of brokerage in social networks. We
	elaborate on the concept of brokerage as a process, identifying three
	distinct classes of brokerage behavior. Based on this process model, we
	develop a framework for measuring brokerage opportunities in dynamic
	relational data. Using data on emergent inter-organizational
	collaborations, we employ the dynamic brokerage framework to examine the
	relationship between organizational attributes and coordination in the
	evolving network. Comparing the findings of our process-based definition
	with traditional, static approaches, we identify important dimensions of
	organizational action that would be missed by the latter approach. (C)

	Abstract = {Social media can be a double-edged sword for society, either as a
	convenient channel exchanging ideas or as an unexpected conduit
	circulating fake news through a large population. While existing studies
	of fake news focus on theoretical modeling of propagation or
	identification methods based on machine learning, it is important to
	understand the realistic propagation mechanisms between theoretical
	models and black-box methods. Here we track large databases of fake news
	and real news in both, Weibo in China and Twitter in Japan from
	different cultures, which include their traces of re-postings. We find
	in both online social networks that fake news spreads distinctively from
	real news even at early stages of propagation, e.g. five hours after the
	first re-postings. Our finding demonstrates collective structural
	signals that help to understand the different propagation evolution of
	fake news and real news. Different from earlier studies, identifying the
	topological properties of the information propagation at early stages
	may offer novel features for early detection of fake news in social
	media.},

	Abstract = {Network analysis is on the rise across scientific disciplines because of
	its ability to reveal complex, and often emergent, patterns and
	dynamics. Nonetheless, a growing concern in network analysis is the use
	of limited data for constructing networks. This concern is strikingly
	relevant to ecology and conservation biology, where network analysis is
	used to infer connectivity across landscapes. In this context, movement
	among patches is the crucial parameter for interpreting connectivity but
	because of the difficulty of collecting reliable movement data, most
	network analysis proceeds with only indirect information on movement
	across landscapes rather than using observed movement to construct
	networks. Statistical models developed for social networks provide
	promising alternatives for landscape network construction because they
	can leverage limited movement information to predict linkages. Using two
	mark-recapture datasets on individual movement and connectivity across
	landscapes, we test whether commonly used network constructions for
	interpreting connectivity can predict actual linkages and network
	structure, and we contrast these approaches to social network models. We
	find that currently applied network constructions for assessing
	connectivity consistently, and substantially, overpredict actual
	connectivity, resulting in considerable overestimation of metapopulation
	lifetime. Furthermore, social network models provide accurate
	predictions of network structure, and can do so with remarkably limited
	data on movement. Social network models offer a flexible and powerful
	way for not only understanding the factors influencing connectivity but
	also for providing more reliable estimates of connectivity and
	metapopulation persistence in the face of limited data.},

	is to be working for pay. We also find evidence that suggests
	disadvantaged women with children must also rely on their social support

	Abstract = {Standard epidemiological models for COVID-19 employ variants of
	compartment (SIR or susceptible-infectious-recovered) models at local
	scales, implicitly assuming spatially uniform local mixing. Here, we
	examine the effect of employing more geographically detailed diffusion
	models based on known spatial features of interpersonal networks, most
	particularly the presence of a long-tailed but monotone decline in the
	probability of interaction with distance, on disease diffusion. Based on
	simulations of unrestricted COVID-19 diffusion in 19 US cities, we
	conclude that heterogeneity in population distribution can have large
	impacts on local pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate
	behavior at larger scales mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts
	observed include severe local outbreaks with long lag time relative to
	the aggregate infection curve, and the presence of numerous areas whose
	disease trajectories correlate poorly with those of neighboring areas. A
	simple catchment model for hospital demand illustrates potential
	implications for health care utilization, with substantial disparities
	in the timing and extremity of impacts even without distancing
	interventions. Likewise, analysis of social exposure to others who are
	morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic can
	appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk
	assessment and compliance with mitigation measures. These results
	demonstrate the potential for spatial network structure to generate
	highly nonuniform diffusion behavior even at the scale of cities, and
	suggest the importance of incorporating such structure when designing
	models to inform health care planning, predict community outcomes, or

	and underestimation of the size of a minority group can emerge solely
	from structural properties of social networks. Using a generative
	network model, we show that these biases depend on the level of
	homophily, its asymmetric nature and on the size of the minority group.
	Our model predictions correspond well with empirical data from a
	cross-cultural survey and with numerical calculations from six
	real-world networks. We also identify circumstances under which
	individuals can reduce their biases by relying on perceptions of their

	can be accurately measured using this characteristic number, which is

	characteristic of human communities. These emergent outcomes are thought
	to occur owing to a dynamic system of information sharing and memory
	updating, which fundamentally depends on communication. Here we report
	results on the formation of collective memories in laboratory-created
	communities. We manipulated conversational network structure in a series
	of real-time, computer-mediated interactions in fourteen 10-member
	communities. The results show that mnemonic convergence, measured as the
	degree of overlap among community members' memories, is influenced by
	both individual-level information-processing phenomena and by the
	conversational social network structure created during conversational
	recall. By studying laboratory-created social networks, we show how
	large-scale social phenomena (i.e., collective memory) can emerge out of
	microlevel local dynamics (i.e., mnemonic reinforcement and suppression
	effects). The social-interactionist approach proposed herein points to
	optimal strategies for spreading information in social networks and

	number of prosocial activities is strongly positively associated with

	more prosocial behaviors expected for every friend added. Moreover,
	having more friends is associated with an improvement in health, while

	Specifically, a unit increase in health is associated with an expected
	0.45 percentage-point increase in average closeness, while adding a
	prosocial activity is associated with a 0.46 percentage-point increase
	in the closeness of one's relationships. Furthermore, a tradeoff between
	degree and closeness of social contacts was observed. As the number of
	close social contacts increases by one, the estimated average closeness
	of each individual contact decreases by approximately three

	showed that the extent of the support was affected neither by the

	Living far from one's birthplace, however, exerted two distinct, and
	opposite effects on the support network structure. On the one hand,
	mobility led to high spatial dispersion of personal contacts, which in
	turn favored a sparsely knit network centered around the mobile
	individual. On the other hand, by controlling for the effect of distance
	between the contacts, we found that individuals that cited long-distance
	ties tended to be part of more transitive support networks than those
	that cited local ties. We interpreted the latter effect as evidence that
	transitive ties may survive greater spatial distances than intransitive
	ones. These findings are discussed in view of spatial mobility and

	Abstract = {In this paper, we explore the potential implications of geographical
	variability for the structure of social networks. Beginning with some
	basic simplifying assumptions, we derive a number of ways in which local
	network structure should be expected to vary across a region whose
	population is unevenly distributed. To examine the manner in which these
	effects would be expected to manifest given realistic population
	distributions, we then perform an exploratory simulation study that
	examines the features of large-scale interpersonal networks generated
	using block-level data from the 2000 U.S. Census. Using a stratified
	sample of micropolitan and metropolitan areas with populations ranging
	from approximately 1000 to 1,000,000 persons, we extrapolatively
	simulate network structure using spatial network models calibrated to
	two fairly proximate social relations. From this sample of simulated
	networks, we examine the effect of both within-location and
	between-location heterogeneity on a variety of structural properties. As
	we demonstrate, geographical variability produces large and distinctive
	features in the ``social fabric{''} that overlies it; at the same time,
	however, many aggregate network properties can be fairly well-predicted
	from relatively simple spatial demographic variables. The impact of
	geographical variability is thus predicted to depend substantially on
	the type of network property being assessed, and on the spatial scale
	involved. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Online social systems are multiplex in nature as multiple links may

	work, we study the geo-social properties of multiplex links, spanning

	services. Exploring the intersection of two popular online platforms
	Twitter and location-based social network Foursquare - we represent the

	are more similar in terms of their social and spatial properties on both
	platforms in comparison with pairs who are connected on just one of the
	social networks. Our evaluation, which aims to shed light on the
	implications of multiplexity for the link generation process, shows that
	we can successfully predict links across social networking services. In

	Journal = {PLOS ONE},
	Year = {2018},
	Volume = {13},
	Number = {12},
	Month = {DEC 19},
	Abstract = {Background
	During epidemic crises, some of the information the public receives on
	social media is misinformation. Health organizations are required to
	respond and correct the information to gain the public's trust and
	influence it to follow the recommended instructions.
	Objectives
	(1) To examine ways for health organizations to correct misinformation
	concerning the measles vaccination on social networks for two groups:
	pro-vaccination and hesitant; (2) To examine the types of reactions of
	two subgroups (pro-vaccination, hesitant) to misinformation correction;
	and (3) To examine the effect of misinformation correction on these two
	subgroups regarding reliability, satisfaction, self-efficacy and
	intentions.
	Methods
	A controlled experiment with participants divided randomly into two
	conditions. In both experiment conditions a dilemma was presented as to
	sending a child to kindergarten, followed by an identical Facebook post
	voicing the children mothers' concerns. In the third stage the
	correction by the health organization is presented differently in two
	conditions: Condition 1 -common information correction, and Condition
	2-recommended (theory-based) information correction, mainly
	communicating information transparently and addressing the public's
	concerns. The study included (n = 243) graduate students from the
	Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences at Haifa University.
	Results
	A statistically significant difference was found in the reliability
	level attributed to information correction by the Health Ministry
	between the Control condition and Experimental condition (sig<0.001),
	with the average reliability level of the subjects in Condition 2 (M =
	5.68) being considerably higher than the average reliability level of
	subjects in Condition 1 (4.64). A significant difference was found
	between Condition 1 and Condition 2 (sig<0.001), with the average
	satisfaction from the Health Ministry's response of Condition 2 subjects
	(M = 5.75) being significantly higher than the average satisfaction
	level of Condition 1 subjects (4.66). Similarly, when we tested the pro
	and hesitant groups separately, we found that both preferred the
	response presented in Condition 2.
	Conclusion
	It is very important for the organizations to correct misinformation
	transparently, and to address the emotional aspects for both the
	pro-vaccination and the hesitant groups. The pro-vaccination group is
	not a captive audience, and it too requires a full response that
	addresses the public's fears and concerns.},

	method for computing an upper bound on the expected time it takes for
	the innovation to become established in any finite network. For example,
	if agents choose log-linear responses to what their neighbors are doing,
	it takes on average less than 80 revision periods for the innovation to
	diffuse widely in any network, provided that the error rate is at least
	5\% and the payoff gain (relative to the status quo) is at least 150\%.
	Qualitatively similar results hold for other smoothed best-response

	Abstract = {Research in computer-mediated communication has consistently asserted
	that Facebook use is positively correlated with social capital. This
	research has drawn primarily on Williams' (2006) bridging and bonding
	scales as well as behavioral attributes such as civic engagement. Yet,
	as social capital is inherently a structural construct, it is surprising
	that so little work has been done relating social capital to social
	structure as captured by social network site (SNS) Friendship networks.
	Facebook is particularly well-suited to support the examination of
	structure at the ego level since the networks articulated on Facebook
	tend to be large, dense, and indicative of many offline foci (e.g.,
	coworkers, friends from high school). Assuming that each one of these
	foci only partially overlap, we initially present two hypotheses related
	to Facebook social networks and social capital: more foci are associated
	with perceptions of greater bridging social capital and more closure is
	associated with greater bonding social capital. Using a study of 235
	employees at a Midwestern American university, we test these hypotheses
	alongside self-reported measures of activity on the site. Our results
	only partially confirm these hypotheses. In particular, using a widely
	used measure of closure (transitivity) we observe a strong and
	persistent negative relationship to bonding social capital. Although
	this finding is initially counter-intuitive it is easily explained by
	considering the topology of Facebook personal networks: networks with
	primarily closed triads tend to be networks with tightly bound foci
	(such as everyone from high school knowing each other) and few
	connections between foci. Networks with primarily open triads signify
	many crosscutting friendships across foci. Therefore, bonding social
	capital appears to be less tied to local clustering than to global
	cohesion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The friendship paradox states that your friends have on average more
	friends than you have. Does the paradox ``hold'' for other individual
	characteristics like income or happiness? To address this question, we
	generalize the friendship paradox for arbitrary node characteristics in
	complex networks. By analyzing two coauthorship networks of Physical
	Review journals and Google Scholar profiles, we find that the
	generalized friendship paradox (GFP) holds at the individual and network
	levels for various characteristics, including the number of coauthors,
	the number of citations, and the number of publications. The origin of
	the GFP is shown to be rooted in positive correlations between degree
	and characteristics. As a fruitful application of the GFP, we suggest
	effective and efficient sampling methods for identifying high
	characteristic nodes in large-scale networks. Our study on the GFP can
	shed lights on understanding the interplay between network structure and
	node characteristics in complex networks.},

	Abstract = {Triadic configurations are fundamental to many social structural
	processes and provide the basis for a variety of social network theories
	and methodologies. This paper addresses the question of how much of the
	patterning of triads is accounted for by lower-order properties
	pertaining to nodes and dyads. The empirical base is a collection of 82
	social networks representing a number of different species (humans,
	baboons, macaques, bison, cattle, goats, sparrows, caribou, and more)
	and an assortment of social relations (friendship, negative sentiments,
	choice of work partners, advice seeking, reported social interactions,
	victories in agonistic encounters, dominance, and co-observation).
	Methodology uses low-dimensional representations of triad censuses for
	these social networks, as compared to censuses expected given four
	lower-order social network properties. Results show that triadic
	structure is largely accounted for by properties more local than triads:
	network density, nodal indegree and outdegree distributions, and the
	dyad census. These findings reinforce the observation that structural
	configurations that can be realized it? empirical social networks are
	severely constrained by very local network properties, making some

	Abstract = {Individual preferences for same-ethnic friends contribute to persistent
	segregation of adolescents' friendship networks. Yet, we know
	surprisingly little about the mechanisms behind ethnic homophily. Prior
	research suggests that ethnic homophily is ubiquitous, but a social
	identity perspective indicates that strong ingroup identification drives
	ingroup favoritism. Combining a social identity perspective with a
	relational approach, we ask whether the presumed increased homophily of
	high identifiers extends to all ingroup members, or whether it is
	conditional on the strength of same-ethnics' identification. We propose
	that the strength of ethnic identification affects not only how much
	individuals desire same-ethnic friends, but also how attractive they are
	as potential friends to others. Fitting stochastic actor-oriented models
	to German adolescent school-based network panel data, we find that
	ethnic homophily is driven by an interplay of peers' ethnic
	identification: high identifiers befriend same-ethnic peers who share
	their strong ethnic identification, while excluding same-ethnic low
	identifiers. Low identifiers, in turn, tend to avoid befriending
	inter-ethnic high identifiers. Our relational approach reveals that
	ethnic homophily is hardly ubiquitous but requires strong identification
	of both parties of a (potential) friendship.},

	there is a growing divergence between how social capital is commonly

	This departure raises questions about the validity of some of the most
	widely cited studies of social capital and ICTs. We compare the Internet
	Social Capital Scales (ISCS) developed by Williams {[}2006. On and off

	commonly used to measure `social capital' - to established, structural
	measures of social capital: name, position, and resource generators.
	Based on a survey of 880 undergraduate students (the population to which
	the ISCS has been most frequently administered), we find that, unlike
	structural measures, the ISCS does not distinguish between the distinct
	constructs of bonding and bridging social capital. The ISCS does not
	have convergent validity with structural measures of bonding or bridging
	social capital; it does not measure the same concept as structural
	measures. The ISCS conflates social capital with the related constructs
	of social support and attachment. The ISCS does not measure perceived or
	actual social capital. These findings raise concerns about the
	interpretations of existing studies of `social capital' and ICTs that
	are based on the ISCS. Given the absence of measurement validity, we
	urge those studying social capital to abandon the ISCS in favor of
	alternative approaches.},

	Abstract = {Identifying influential spreaders in networks is an essential issue in
	order to prevent epidemic spreading, or to accelerate information
	diffusion. Several centrality measures take advantage of various network
	topological properties to quantify the notion of influence. However, the
	vast majority of works ignore its community structure while it is one of
	the main features of many real-world networks. In a recent study, we
	show that the centrality of a node in a network with non-overlapping
	communities depends on two features: Its local influence on the nodes
	belonging to its community, and its global influence on the nodes
	belonging to the other communities. Using global and local connectivity
	of the nodes, we introduced a framework allowing to redefine all the
	classical centrality measures (designed for networks without community
	structure) to non-overlapping modular networks. In this paper, we extend
	the so-called ``Modular Centrality{''} to networks with overlapping
	communities. Indeed, it is a frequent scenario in real-world networks,
	especially for social networks where nodes usually belong to several
	communities. The ``Overlapping Modular Centrality{''} is a
	two-dimensional measure that quantifies the local and global influence
	of overlapping and non-overlapping nodes. Extensive experiments have
	been performed on synthetic and real-world data using the
	Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model. Results show that
	the Overlapping Modular Centrality outperforms its alternatives designed
	for non-modular networks. These investigations provide better knowledge
	on the influence of the various parameters governing the overlapping
	community structure on the nodes' centrality. Additionally, two
	combinations of the components of the Overlapping Modular Centrality are
	evaluated. Comparative analysis with competing methods shows that they
	produce more efficient centrality scores.},

	Abstract = {Daily interactions naturally define social circles. Individuals tend to
	be friends with the people they spend time with and they choose to spend
	time with their friends, inextricably entangling physical location and
	social relationships. As a result, it is possible to predict not only
	someone's location from their friends' locations but also friendship
	from spatial and temporal co-occurrence. While several models have been
	developed to separately describe mobility and the evolution of social
	networks, there is a lack of studies coupling social interactions and
	mobility. In this work, we introduce a model that bridges this gap by
	explicitly considering the feedback of mobility on the formation of
	social ties. Data coming from three online social networks (Twitter,
	Gowalla and Brightkite) is used for validation. Our model reproduces
	various topological and physical properties of the networks not captured
	by models uncoupling mobility and social interactions such as: i) the
	total size of the connected components, ii) the distance distribution
	between connected users, iii) the dependence of the reciprocity on the
	distance, iv) the variation of the social overlap and the clustering
	with the distance. Besides numerical simulations, a mean-field approach
	is also used to study analytically the main statistical features of the
	networks generated by a simplified version of our model. The robustness
	of the results to changes in the model parameters is explored, finding
	that a balance between friend visits and long-range random connections
	is essential to reproduce the geographical features of the empirical

	comparing clusterings; clustering comparison is the basis for many tasks

	as a model system to study information flow in collective decisions.
	Players are assigned to competing groups (parties) and placed on an
	`influence network' that determines whose voting intentions each player
	can observe. Players are incentivized to vote according to partisan
	interest, but also to coordinate their vote with the entire group. Our
	mathematical analysis uncovers a phenomenon that we call information
	gerrymandering: the structure of the influence network can sway the vote
	outcome towards one party, even when both parties have equal sizes and
	each player has the same influence. A small number of zealots, when
	strategically placed on the influence network, can also induce
	information gerrymandering and thereby bias vote outcomes. We confirm
	the predicted effects of information gerrymandering in social network
	experiments with n = 2,520 human subjects. Furthermore, we identify
	extensive information gerrymandering in real-world influence networks,
	including online political discussions leading up to the US federal
	elections, and in historical patterns of bill co-sponsorship in the US
	Congress and European legislatures. Our analysis provides an account of
	the vulnerabilities of collective decision-making to systematic
	distortion by restricted information flow. Our analysis also highlights
	a group-level social dilemma: information gerrymandering can enable one
	party to sway decisions in its favour, but when multiple parties engage

	Abstract = {Intergroup violence is common among humans worldwide. To assess how
	within-group social dynamics contribute to risky, between-group
	conflict, we conducted a 3-y longitudinal study of the formation of
	raiding parties among the Nyangatom, a group of East African nomadic
	pastoralists currently engaged in small-scale warfare. We also mapped
	the social network structure of potential male raiders. Here, we show
	that the initiation of raids depends on the presence of specific leaders
	who tend to participate in many raids, to have more friends, and to
	occupy more central positions in the network. However, despite the
	different structural position of raid leaders, raid participants are
	recruited from the whole population, not just from the direct friends of
	leaders. An individual's decision to participate in a raid is strongly
	associated with the individual's social network position in relation to
	other participants. Moreover, non-leaders have a larger total impact on
	raid participation than leaders, despite leaders' greater connectivity.
	Thus, we find that leaders matter more for raid initiation than
	participant mobilization. Social networks may play a role in supporting
	risky collective action, amplify the emergence of raiding parties, and
	hence facilitate intergroup violence in small-scale societies.},

	Abstract = {Cooperation is essential for successful human societies. Thus,
	understanding how cooperative and selfish behaviors spread from person
	to person is a topic of theoretical and practical importance. Previous
	laboratory experiments provide clear evidence of social contagion in the
	domain of cooperation, both in fixed networks and in randomly shuffled
	networks, but leave open the possibility of asymmetries in the spread of
	cooperative and selfish behaviors. Additionally, many real human
	interaction structures are dynamic: we often have control over whom we
	interact with. Dynamic networks may differ importantly in the goals and
	strategic considerations they promote, and thus the question of how
	cooperative and selfish behaviors spread in dynamic networks remains
	open. Here, we address these questions with data from a social dilemma
	laboratory experiment. We measure the contagion of both cooperative and
	selfish behavior over time across three different network structures
	that vary in the extent to which they afford individuals control over
	their network ties. We find that in relatively fixed networks, both
	cooperative and selfish behaviors are contagious. In contrast, in more
	dynamic networks, selfish behavior is contagious, but cooperative
	behavior is not: subjects are fairly likely to switch to cooperation
	regardless of the behavior of their neighbors. We hypothesize that this
	insensitivity to the behavior of neighbors in dynamic networks is the
	result of subjects' desire to attract new cooperative partners: even if
	many of one's current neighbors are defectors, it may still make sense
	to switch to cooperation. We further hypothesize that selfishness
	remains contagious in dynamic networks because of the well-documented
	willingness of cooperators to retaliate against selfishness, even when
	doing so is costly. These results shed light on the contagion of
	cooperative behavior in fixed and fluid networks, and have implications
	for influence-based interventions aiming at increasing cooperative
	behavior.},

	a relatively new sampling methodology that circumvents this difficulty

	has been shown to provide unbiased estimates of population proportions
	given certain conditions. The method is now widely used in human
	immunodeficiency virus related studies among high risk populations

	social networks of a large Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Web
	community. The robustness of the RDS method is tested by violating, one
	by one, the conditions under which the method provides unbiased
	estimates. Simulations indicate that the bias is large if networks are
	directed or respondents choose to invite people on the basis of
	characteristics that are correlated with the study outcomes. The bias
	and variance increase if participants invite close as opposed to more
	distant friends whereas sampling in denser networks sharply reduces
	variance. However, the RDS method shows strong resistance to sampling
	without replacement, low response rates and certain errors in the
	participants reporting of their network sizes, as well as the selection
	criteria of seeds. The effects of network structure and the number of
	seeds and coupons are also discussed.},

	students are more likely that their 6th form counter-parts to have

	mobilisation are low both on and off campus. In the second part of the

	politicisation to be found in the social movements literature. Having
	criticised these theories and noted that they are challenged by my

	campus-based social networks. University campuses, I suggest, facilitate
	the formation of a critical and connected mass of previously politicised
	actors who then use their further networks to recruit political novices
	into activism. It is this recruitment activity, which is greatly
	enhanced by the network structure of campus life, which explains the

	show that a simple method can yield not just early detection, but
	advance warning of contagious outbreaks. In this method, we randomly
	choose a small fraction of nodes in the network and then we randomly
	choose a friend of each node to include in a group for local monitoring.
	Using six months of data from most of the full Twittersphere, we show
	that this friend group is more central in the network and it helps us to
	detect viral outbreaks of the use of novel hashtags about 7 days earlier
	than we could with an equal-sized randomly chosen group. Moreover, the
	method actually works better than expected due to network structure
	alone because highly central actors are both more active and exhibit
	increased diversity in the information they transmit to others. These
	results suggest that local monitoring is not just more efficient, but
	also more effective, and it may be applied to monitor contagious

	vaccination coverage.
	Methods Our community-academic-public health partnership, ``Unidos en
	Salud,{''} utilized a theory-informed approach to design our ``Motivate,
	Vaccinate, and Activate{''} COVID-19 vaccination strategy. Our
	strategy's design was guided by the PRECEDE Model and sought to address
	and overcome predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing barriers to
	COVID-19 vaccination faced by Latinx individuals in San Francisco. We
	evaluated our prototype outdoor, ``neighborhood{''} vaccination program
	located in a central commercial and transport hub in the Mission
	District in San Francisco, using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
	Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework during a 16-week
	period from February 1, 2021 to May 19, 2021. Programmatic data,
	city-wide COVID-19 surveillance data, and a survey conducted between May
	2, 2021 and May 19, 2021 among 997 vaccinated clients >= 16 years old
	were used in the evaluation.
	Results There were 20,792 COVID-19 vaccinations administered at the
	neighborhood site during the 16-week evaluation period. Vaccine
	recipients had a median age of 43 (IQR 32-56) years, 53.9\% were male
	and 70.5\% were Latinx, 14.1\% white, 7.7\% Asian, 2.4\% Black, and
	5.3\% other. Latinx vaccinated clients were substantially more likely
	than non-Latinx clients to have an annual household income of less than
	\$50,000 a year (76.1\% vs. 33.5\%), be a first-generation immigrant
	(60.2\% vs. 30.1\%), not have health insurance (47.3\% vs. 16.0\%), and
	not have access to primary care provider (62.4\% vs. 36.2\%). The most
	frequently reported reasons for choosing vaccination at the site were
	its neighborhood location (28.6\%), easy and convenient scheduling
	(26.9\%) and recommendation by someone they trusted (18.1\%);
	approximately 99\% reported having an overall positive experience,
	regardless of ethnicity. Notably, 58.3\% of clients reported that they
	were able to get vaccinated earlier because of the neighborhood
	vaccination site, 98.4\% of clients completed both vaccine doses, and
	90.7\% said that they were more likely to recommend COVID-19 vaccination
	to family and friends after their experience; these findings did not
	substantially differ according to ethnicity. There were 40.3\% of
	vaccinated clients who said they still knew at least one unvaccinated
	person (64.6\% knew >= 3). Among clients who received both vaccine doses
	(n = 729), 91.0\% said that after their vaccination experience, they had
	personally reached out to at least one unvaccinated person they knew
	(61.6\% reached out to >= 3) to recommend getting vaccinated; 83.0\% of
	clients reported that one or more friends, and/or family members got
	vaccinated as a result of their outreach, including 18.9\% who reported
	6 or more persons got vaccinated as a result of their influence.
	Conclusions A multi-component, ``Motivate, Vaccinate, and Activate{''}
	community-based strategy addressing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination for
	the Latinx population reached the intended population, and vaccinated
	individuals served as ambassadors to recruit other friends and family
	members to get vaccinated.},

	digital activism inequalities between working-class and

	observations reveal that the mechanisms of this digital activism gap are
	organizational resources, along with individual disparities in access,

	investigated how farmers' membership in three major social groups
	interacts in shaping sorghum seed exchange networks in a cultural
	contact zone on Mount Kenya. Farmers are members of residence groups at
	the local scale and of dialect groups clustered within larger
	ethnolinguistic units at a wider scale. The Chuka and Tharaka, who are
	allied in the same ethnolinguistic unit, coexist with the Mbeere dialect
	group in the study area. We assessed farmers' homophily, propensity to
	exchange seeds with members of the same group, using exponential random
	graph models. We showed that homophily is significant within both
	residence and ethnolinguistic groups. At these two levels, homophily is
	driven by the kinship system, particularly by the combination of
	patrilocal residence and ethnolinguistic endogamy, because most seeds
	are exchanged among relatives. Indeed, residential homophily in seed
	exchanges results from local interactions between women and their in-law
	family, whereas at a higher level, ethnolinguistic homophily is driven
	by marriage endogamy. Seed exchanges and marriage ties are interrelated,
	and both are limited between the Mbeere and the other groups, although
	frequent between the Chuka and Tharaka. The impact of these social
	homophily processes on crop diversity is discussed.},

	Our findings demonstrate that pure similarity promotes reciprocity in

	networking websites and banner advertisements) and offline (local
	clinics, restaurants and organizations) venues frequented by minority

	completed an online survey on their social media usage and sexual risk
	behaviors. Results from a multivariable regression suggest that number
	of sexual partners met from online social networking technologies is

	Abstract = {Opinion formation and innovation diffusion have gained lots of attention
	in the last decade due to its application in social and political
	science. Control of the diffusion process usually takes place using the
	most influential people in the society, called opinion leaders or key
	players. But the opinion leaders can hardly be accessed or hired for
	spreading the desired opinion or information. This is where informed
	agents can play a key role. Informed agents are common people, not
	distinguishable from the other members of the society that act in
	coordination. In this paper we show that informed agents are able to
	gradually shift the public opinion toward a desired goal through
	microscopic interactions. In order to do so they pretend to have an
	opinion similar to others, but while interacting with them, gradually
	and intentionally change their opinion toward the desired direction. In
	this paper a computational model for opinion formation by the informed
	agents based on the bounded confidence model is proposed. The effects of
	different parameter settings including population size of the informed
	agents, their characteristics, and network structure, are investigated.
	The results show that social and open-minded informed agents are more

	Abstract = {Background
	The pathway from evidence generation to consumption contains many steps
	which can lead to overstatement or misinformation. The proliferation of
	internet-based health news may encourage selection of media and academic
	research articles that overstate strength of causal inference. We
	investigated the state of causal inference in health research as it
	appears at the end of the pathway, at the point of social media
	consumption.
	Methods
	We screened the NewsWhip Insights database for the most shared media
	articles on Facebook and Twitter reporting about peer-reviewed academic
	studies associating an exposure with a health outcome in 2015,
	extracting the 50 most-shared academic articles and media articles
	covering them. We designed and utilized a review tool to systematically
	assess and summarize studies' strength of causal inference, including
	generalizability, potential confounders, and methods used. These were
	then compared with the strength of causal language used to describe
	results in both academic and media articles. Two randomly assigned
	independent reviewers and one arbitrating reviewer from a pool of 21
	reviewers assessed each article.
	Results
	We accepted the most shared 64 media articles pertaining to 50 academic
	articles for review, representing 68\% of Facebook and 45\% of Twitter
	shares in 2015. Thirty-four percent of academic studies and 48\% of
	media articles used language that reviewers considered too strong for
	their strength of causal inference. Seventy percent of academic studies
	were considered low or very low strength of inference, with only 6\%
	considered high or very high strength of causal inference. The most
	severe issues with academic studies' causal inference were reported to
	be omitted confounding variables and generalizability. Fifty-eight
	percent of media articles were found to have inaccurately reported the
	question, results, intervention, or population of the academic study.
	Conclusions
	We find a large disparity between the strength of language as presented
	to the research consumer and the underlying strength of causal inference
	among the studies most widely shared on social media. However, because
	this sample was designed to be representative of the articles selected
	and shared on social media, it is unlikely to be representative of all
	academic and media work. More research is needed to determine how
	academic institutions, media organizations, and social network sharing
	patterns impact causal inference and language as received by the
	research consumer.},

	Abstract = {The Manchester (UK) music scene has been extremely important in the
	development of independent and alternative music within Europe. As such
	it has been the topic of two major films. It is commonly held that the
	Manchester scene `took off' in the late 1970s. This paper observes that
	its `take off' was facilitated by the formation of a network between a
	critical mass of key social actors. The aim of the paper is to
	demonstrate this process of network formation and to seek to contribute
	to its explanation by identifying the key mechanisms (of network
	formation) involved.
	The paper uses formal social network analysis to map the network in
	question and to demonstrate its growth. It uses a more straightforward
	historical-sociological approach, which is qualitative and archival in
	nature, to identify the salient mechanisms. The paper adds an
	interesting and important case study to the existing literature on music
	scenes and also suggests a novel way for both advancing research on
	music scenes and further extending the use of social network analysis
	(and network analytic concepts) in relation to the arts. Finally, it
	makes an important empirical contribution to the newly emerging area of

	Web links between organizational websites are used as a proxy. Indeed,

	propaganda and their recruitment, and also for their internal
	communication. The analysis includes both political parties and
	non-party organizations, even violent groups. In a macro-, micro-, and
	meso-analysis, the various specificities of the two national political
	sectors are demonstrated and linked to the offline reality. The Italian
	network appears to be very fragmented, highly diversified, and difficult
	to be coordinated ('policephalous network'), whereas the German network
	is denser and much more concentrated on a few central actors ('star
	structure'). These differences are mainly due to political opportunity
	structures in the two countries. Additionally, whereas the Italian
	network structure allows for the construction of a typology of
	sub-groups of organizations, the German communicative structure seems to
	be more erratic and less coordinated. The article also highlights the
	function of websites which are not related to any specific group.
	Indeed, these are of special importance for the far right as a political
	arena which is usually banned from the dominant societal discourses (if
	not even legally forbidden). Considering this, new modes of
	communication can be of greater use for extremist groups than for more

	Abstract = {In policy networks actors use access relations to influence preferences
	of other actors. Establishment and shifts of access relations and their
	consequences for outcomes of decisions are the main focal points in this
	paper. Unlike most policy network studies, we therefore do not take the
	network and its relations as given and constant. Instead we device
	computer simulation models to account for the dynamics in policy
	networks. We compare different models and investigate the resulting
	network structures and predicted outcomes of decisions. The choice among
	the alternative models is made by their correspondence with empirical
	network structures and actual outcomes of decisions.
	In our models, we assume that all relevant actors aim at policy outcomes
	as close as possible to their own preferences. Policy outcomes are
	determined by the preferences df the final decision makers at the moment
	of the vote. In general, only a small fraction of the actors takes part
	in the final vote. Most actors have therefore to rely on access
	relations for directly or indirectly shaping the preferences of the
	final decision makers. For this purpose actors make access requests to
	other actors. An access relation is assumed to be established if such a
	request is accepted by the other actor.
	Access relations require time and resources. Actors are therefore
	assumed to be restricted in the number of access requests they can make
	and the number of requests they can accept Moreover, due to incomplete
	information and simultaneous actions by other actors, actors have to
	make simplifying assumptions in the selection of their `'best'' requests
	and learn by experience.
	We device two base models that correspond to two basic views on the
	nature of political processes. In the first view politics is seen as
	power driven. Corresponding to this view, actors aim at access relations
	with the most powerful actors in the field. They estimate their
	likelihood of success by comparing their own resources with those of the
	target actors. Power also determines the order in which actors accept
	requests. In the second view, policy matters and actors roughly estimate
	the effects access relations might have on the outcome of decisions.
	Actors select requests to `'bolster'' their own preference as much as
	possible.
	We will show that these base models and some intermediate ones result in
	fundamentally different network structures and predicted outcomes.
	Moreover, we will show that the policy driven models do fundamentally
	better than the power driven models.},

	Abstract = {Modern technology has drastically changed the way we interact and

	seamless communication exchanges at an unprecedented scale. However, we
	are still bounded by cognitive and temporal constraints. Our attention
	is limited and extremely valuable. Algorithmic personalisation has
	become a standard approach to tackle the information overload problem.
	As result, the exposure to our friends' opinions and our perception
	about important issues might be distorted. However, the effects of
	algorithmic gatekeeping on our hyper-connected society are poorly
	understood. Here, we devise an opinion dynamics model where individuals
	are connected through a social network and adopt opinions as function of
	the view points they are exposed to. We apply various filtering
	algorithms that select the opinions shown to each user (i) at random
	(ii) considering time ordering or (iii) its current opinion.
	Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between such mechanisms and
	crucial features of real networks. We found that algorithmic filtering
	might influence opinions' share and distributions, especially in case
	information is biased towards the current opinion of each user. These
	effects are reinforced in networks featuring topological and spatial
	correlations where echo chambers and polarisation emerge. Conversely,
	heterogeneity in connectivity patterns reduces such tendency. We
	consider also a scenario where one opinion, through nudging, is
	centrally pushed to all users. Interestingly, even minimal nudging is
	able to change the status quo moving it towards the desired view point.
	Our findings suggest that simple filtering algorithms might be powerful
	tools to regulate opinion dynamics taking place on social networks.},

	Abstract = {Social interaction and data integration in the digital society can
	affect the control that individuals have on their privacy. Social
	networking sites can access data from other services, including user
	contact lists where nonusers are listed too. Although most research on
	online privacy has focused on inference of personal information of
	users, this data integration poses the question of whether it is
	possible to predict personal information of nonusers. This article tests
	the shadow profile hypothesis, which postulates that the data given by
	the users of an online service predict personal information of nonusers.
	Using data from a disappeared social networking site, we perform a
	historical audit to evaluate whether personal data of nonusers could
	have been predicted with the personal data and contact lists shared by
	the users of the site. We analyze personal information of sexual
	orientation and relationship status, which follow regular mixing
	patterns in the social network. Going back in time over the growth of
	the network, we measure predictor performance as a function of network
	size and tendency of users to disclose their contact lists. This article
	presents robust evidence supporting the shadow profile hypothesis and
	reveals a multiplicative effect of network size and disclosure
	tendencies that accelerates the performance of predictors. These results
	call for new privacy paradigms that take into account the fact that
	individual privacy decisions do not happen in isolation and are mediated
	by the decisions of others.},

	behavior of their peers, are central to social science. Because peer
	effects are often confounded with homophily and common external causes,
	recent work has used randomized experiments to estimate effects of
	specific peer behaviors. These experiments have often relied on the
	experimenter being able to randomly modulate mechanisms by which peer
	behavior is transmitted to a focal individual. We describe experimental
	designs that instead randomly assign individuals' peers to
	encouragements to behaviors that directly affect those individuals. We
	illustrate this method with a large peer encouragement design on
	Facebook for estimating the effects of receiving feedback from peers on
	posts shared by focal individuals. We find evidence for substantial
	effects of receiving marginal feedback on multiple behaviors, including
	giving feedback to others and continued posting. These findings provide
	experimental evidence for the role of behaviors directed at specific
	individuals in the adoption and continued use of communication
	technologies. In comparison, observational estimates differ
	substantially, both underestimating and overestimating effects,

	On the one hand, these offline gatherings may provide individual

	these gatherings do not necessarily benefit the community at large as
	the resources found in weak ties may be sacrificed as attendees favour
	interaction with one another to the detriment of those that do not
	attend meetups. Non-obtrusive analysis of over eight years of user
	activity from a large, active online community suggests that the
	development of multiplex relationships - relationships maintained both
	online and offline enhances attendees' engagement with the online
	community as a whole, strengthens ties to other attendees, and
	contributes to the creation of bonding social capital. However, weak

	Bourdieu includes social capital as one of the key relational elements
	of his social space, but says much less about it than economic or
	cultural capital, and levels of social capital are rarely measured in
	his work. Bourdieu is reluctant to focus on the content of social
	networks as part of his rejection of substantialist thinking. The
	neglect of substantive networks creates problems for Bourdieu's
	framework, because many of Bourdieu's core concepts rest upon
	assumptions about their interactional properties (in particular, the
	prevalence of homophilous differential association) which are left
	unexamined. It is argued here that Bourdieu's neglect of the substance
	of social networks is related to the criticisms that Bourdieu's
	framework often encounters, and that this neglect bears re-examination,
	since it is helpful to think of the ways in which differentiated social
	networks contribute to the development of habitus, help form fields, and
	so constitute the intersubjective social relations within which
	sociality, and practice more generally, occur.},

	Abstract = {World polity theory is explicitly relational, implying a global network
	structure that exists outside of the nation-state. And world polity
	theory increasingly acknowledges power - that some states and regions

	measures of international nongovernmental organizations do not
	adequately incorporate either networks or power, leading to a mismatch
	between theory and measurement. In this article, we draw upon world
	polity, world system and social networks theories to inform the
	development Of a new over-time measure Of country-level connectedness to
	the world polity, which we label the ``INGO Network Country Score.{''}
	This measure scores countries by their centrality in the world
	country-INGO network. We compare our newly-proposed INGO Network Country
	Score to the traditional measure (country-level raw counts of INGO
	memberships) and demonstrate striking differences. Our network-based
	measure shows less inequality among Western countries than the
	traditional measure, and greater inequality between the West and the
	rest of the world. Looking over time, we draw three further implications
	from our new measure. First, there is evidence of inequality in network
	centrality in the world polity at all time points. Second, regional
	inequalities persist. Third, connections in the world polity are not
	exponentially increasing, as previously hypothesized. An added benefit
	of the analysis is our presentation of the first visual representation

	Abstract = {The use of online-communication applications including messengers (e.g.
	WhatsApp) or social networking services (e.g. Facebook) on the

	example during waiting times. An increasing number of individuals show
	diminished control over their usage of these applications despite
	negative consequences in everyday life. This can be referred to as
	Internet-communication disorder (ICD). The current study investigated
	the effect of boredom proneness on symptoms of an ICD. It further
	examined the mediating role of cognitive and affective mechanisms,
	namely expectancies to avoid negative feelings online and cue-induced
	craving. The results of a structural equation model (N = 148) illustrate
	that boredom proneness is a risk factor for the development and
	maintenance of an ICD as it had a significant direct effect on ICD
	symptoms. Furthermore, boredom proneness predicted avoidance
	expectancies as well as cue-induced craving. Both in turn enhanced the
	risk of developing ICD tendencies. Moreover, both variables mediated the
	effect of boredom proneness on ICD and interacted among each other. In
	summary, the results demonstrate that people who have a higher
	susceptibility to experience boredom show higher expectancies to avoid
	negative emotions online, which promotes higher craving reactions when
	being confronted with specific cues (e.g. an incoming message), and

	Abstract = {How cooperation emerges in human societies is both an evolutionary
	enigma and a practical problem with tangible implications for societal
	health. Population structure has long been recognized as a catalyst for
	cooperation because local interactions facilitate reciprocity. Analysis
	of population structure typically assumes bidirectional social
	interactions. But human social interactions are often
	unidirectional-where one individual has the opportunity to contribute
	altruistically to another, but not conversely-as the result of
	organizational hierarchies, social stratification, popularity effects,
	and endogenous mechanisms of network growth. Here we expand the theory
	of cooperation in structured populations to account for both uni- and
	bidirectional social interactions. Even though unidirectional
	interactions remove the opportunity for reciprocity, we find that
	cooperation can nonetheless be favored in directed social networks and
	that cooperation is provably maximized for networks with an intermediate
	proportion of unidirectional interactions, as observed in many empirical
	settings. We also identify two simple structural motifs that allow
	efficient modification of interaction directions to promote cooperation

	Abstract = {An important puzzle in social network research is to explain how
	macro-level structures emerge from micro-level network processes.
	Explaining the emergence and stability of structural groups in social
	networks is particularly difficult for two reasons. First, because
	groups are characterized both by high connectedness within (group
	cohesion) and lack of connectedness between them (group boundaries).
	Second, because a large number of theoretical micro-level network
	processes contribute to their emergence. We argue that traditional
	social network theories that are concerned with the evolution of
	positive relations (forces of attraction) are not sufficient to explain
	the emergence of groups because they lack mechanisms explaining the
	emergence of group boundaries. Models that additionally account for the
	evolution of negative ties (forces of repulsion) may be better suited to
	explain the emergence and stability of groups. We build a theoretical
	model and illustrate its usefulness by fitting stochastic actor-oriented
	models (SAOMs) to empirical data of co-evolving networks of friendship
	and dislike among 479 secondary-school students. The SAOMs include a
	number of newly developed effects expressing the co-evolution between
	positive and negative ties. We then simulate networks from the estimated
	models to explore the micro-macro link. We find that a model that
	considers forces of attraction and repulsion simultaneously is better at
	explaining groups in social networks. In the long run, however, the
	empirically informed simulations generate networks that are too stylized
	to be realistic, raising further questions about model degeneracy and
	time heterogeneity of group processes.},

	Abstract = {Social networks have become a central feature of everyday life. Most
	young people are members of at least one online social network, and they
	naturally provide a great deal of personal information as a condition
	for participation in the rich online social lives these networks afford.
	Increasingly, this information is being used as evidence in criminal and
	even civil legal proceedings. These latter uses, by actors involved in
	the justice system, are typically justified on the grounds that social
	network information is essentially public in nature, and thus does not
	generate a subjective expectation of privacy necessary to support a
	civil rights-based privacy protection. This justification, however, is
	based on the perceptions of individuals who are outside the online
	social network community, rather than reflecting the norms and privacy
	practices of participants in online social networks. This project takes
	a user-centric approach to the question of whether online social spaces
	are public venues, examining of the information-related practices of
	social network participants, focusing on how they treat their own
	information and that of others posted in online social spaces. Our
	results reveal that online social spaces are indeed loci of public
	display rather than private revelation: online profiles are structured
	with the view that `everyone' can see them, even if the explicitly
	intended audience is more limited. These social norms are inconsistent
	with the claim that social media are private spaces; instead, it appears
	that participants view and treat online social networks as public

	Abstract = {Homophily, the tendency of individuals to associate with others who
	share similar traits, has been identified as a major driving force in
	the formation and evolution of social ties. In many cases, it is not
	clear if homophily is the result of a socialization process, where
	individuals change their traits according to the dominance of that trait
	in their local social networks, or if it results from a selection
	process, in which individuals reshape their social networks so that
	their traits match those in the new environment. Here we demonstrate the
	detailed temporal formation of strong homophily in academic achievements
	of high school and university students. We analyze a unique dataset that
	contains information about the detailed time evolution of a friendship
	network of 6,000 students across 42 months. Combining the evolving
	social network data with the time series of the academic performance
	(GPA) of individual students, we show that academic homophily is a
	result of selection: students prefer to gradually reorganize their
	social networks according to their performance levels, rather than
	adapting their performance to the level of their local group. We find no
	signs for a pull effect, where a social environment of good performers
	motivates bad students to improve their performance. We are able to
	understand the underlying dynamics of grades and networks with a simple
	model. The lack of a social pull effect in classical educational
	settings could have important implications for the understanding of the
	observed persistence of segregation, inequality and social immobility in

	To test this hypothesis, we recruited members of a real-world social

	measurements at the scale of places and cities, and their evolution over
	time. By applying the methodology in Singapore using large-scale mobile
	phone and socio-economic datasets, we find a relatively higher level of
	segregation among relatively wealthier classes, a finding that holds for
	both social and physical space. We also highlight the interplay between
	the effect of distance decay and homophily as forces that determine
	communication intensity, defining a notion of characteristic `homophily
	distance' that can be used to measure social segregation across cities.
	The time-resolved analysis reveals the changing landscape of urban
	segregation and the time-varying roles of places. Segregations in
	physical and social space are weakly correlated at the individual level
	but highly correlated when grouped across at least hundreds of
	individuals. The methodology and analysis presented in this paper enable
	a deeper understanding of the dynamics of human segregation in social
	and physical space, which can assist social scientists, planners and
	city authorities in the design of more integrated cities.},

	Abstract = {Techniques for sampling from networks have grown into an important area
	of research across several fields. For sociologists, the possibility of
	sampling from a network is appealing for two reasons: (1) A network
	sample can yield substantively interesting data about network structures
	and social interactions, and (2) it is useful in situations in which
	study populations are difficult or impossible to survey with traditional
	sampling approaches because of the lack of a sampling frame. Despite its
	appeal, methodological concerns about the precision and accuracy of
	network-based sampling methods remain. In particular, recent research
	has shown that sampling from a network using a random walk-based
	approach such as respondent-driven sampling (RDS) can result in a high
	design effect (DE): the ratio of the sampling variance to the sampling
	variance of simple random sampling (SRS). A high DE means that more
	cases must be collected to achieve the same level of precision as SRS.
	In this article, we propose an alternative strategy, network sampling
	with memory (NSM), which collects network data from respondents to
	reduce DEs and, correspondingly, the number of interviews needed to
	achieve a given level of statistical power. NSM combines a ``list''
	mode, in which all individuals on the revealed network list are sampled
	with the same cumulative probability, with a ``search'' mode, which
	gives priority to bridge nodes connecting the current sample to
	unexplored parts of the network. We test the relative efficiency of NSM
	compared with RDS and SRS on 162 school and university networks from the
	National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and Facebook that range
	in size from 110 to 16,278 nodes. The results show that the average DE
	for NSM on these 162 networks is 1.16, which is very close to the
	efficiency of a simple random sample (DE = 1) and 98.5 percent lower
	than the average DE we observed for RDS.},

	family as a source of emotional, social, material and economical
	support; the possibility that friendship is not always intended as a
	source of support, and people can name friends even if they do not
	provide any kind of support; the effect of the network structure on the
	strength of dyads, that will easily disconnect if not embedded in a
	cohesive network.
	Four different kinds of friendship networks have been found: the small
	cliques, the company, the core/periphery structure, and the

	Abstract = {Online social media are information resources that can have a

	Online social media, in particular, are prone to gender inequality, an
	important issue given the link between social media use and employment.
	Understanding gender inequality in social media is a challenging task
	due to the necessity of data sources that can provide large-scale
	measurements across multiple countries. Here, we show how the Facebook
	Gender Divide (FGD), a metric based on aggregated statistics of more
	than 1.4 billion users in 217 countries, explains various aspects of
	worldwide gender inequality. Our analysis shows that the FGD encodes
	gender equality indices in education, health, and economic opportunity.
	We find gender differences in network externalities that suggest that
	using social media has an added value for women. Furthermore, we find
	that low values of the FGD are associated with increases in economic
	gender equality. Our results suggest that online social networks, while
	suffering evident gender imbalance, may lower the barriers that women
	have to access to informational resources and help to narrow the

	services among homeless youth. Social network characteristics have been
	known to be influential in motivating people's decision to seek
	services. Traditional theoretical frameworks applied to studies of
	service use emphasize individual factors over social contexts and

	framework that capture the social network processes that act as barriers
	or facilitators of use of employment services by homeless youth, and
	understand empirically, the salience of each of these constructs in
	influencing the use of employment services among homeless youth. We used
	the ``Event based-approach{''} strategy to recruit a sample of 136
	homeless youth at one drop-in agency serving homeless youth in Los
	Angeles, California in 2008. The participants were queried regarding

	NetDraw 2.090 and the spring embedder routine was used to generate the

	The study findings suggest that social capital is more significant in
	understanding why homeless youth use employment services, relative to
	network structure and network influence. In particular, bonding and
	bridging social capital were found to have differential effects on use

	Abstract = {Humans' propensity to cooperate is driven by our embeddedness in social
	networks. A key mechanism through which networks promote cooperation is
	clustering. Within clusters, conditional cooperators are insulated from
	exploitation by noncooperators, allowing them to reap the benefits of
	cooperation. Dynamic networks, where ties can be shed and new ties
	formed, allow for the endogenous emergence of clusters of cooperators.
	Although past work suggests that either reputation processes or network
	dynamics can increase clustering and cooperation, existing work on
	network dynamics conflates reputations and dynamics. Here we report
	results from a large-scale experiment (total n = 2,675) that embedded
	participants in clustered or random networks that were static or
	dynamic, with varying levels of reputational information. Results show
	that initial network clustering predicts cooperation in static networks,
	but not in dynamic ones. Further, our experiment shows that while
	reputations are important for partner choice, cooperation levels are
	driven purely by dynamics. Supplemental conditions confirmed this lack
	of a reputation effect. Importantly, we find that when participants make
	individual choices to cooperate or defect with each partner, as opposed
	to a single decision that applies to all partners (as is standard in the
	literature on cooperation in networks), cooperation rates in static
	networks are as high as cooperation rates in dynamic networks. This
	finding highlights the importance of structured relations for sustained
	cooperation, and shows how giving experimental participants more
	realistic choices has important consequences for whether dynamic
	networks promote higher levels of cooperation than static networks.},

	Abstract = {Animal groups typically contain individuals with varying degrees of

	on patterns of aggression and affiliative behaviors. This link between
	kinship and social behavior underlies socioecological models which have
	been developed to explain how and why different types of animal
	societies evolve. We tested if kinship and age-sex class homophily in
	two groups of ring-tailed coatis (Nasua nasua) predicted the network
	structure of three different social behaviors: 1) association, 2)
	grooming, and 3) aggression. Each group was studied during two
	consecutive years, resulting in four group-years available for analysis
	(total of 65 individuals). Association patterns were heavily influenced
	by agonistic interactions which typically occurred during feeding
	competition. Grooming networks were shaped by mother-offspring bonds,
	female-female social relationships, and a strong social attraction to
	adult males. Mother-offspring pairs were more likely to associate and
	groom each other, but relatedness had no effect on patterns of
	aggressive behavior. Additionally, kinship had little to no effect on
	coalitionary support during agonistic interactions. Adult females
	commonly came to the aid of juveniles during fights with other group
	members, but females often supported juveniles who were not their
	offspring (57\% of coalitionary interactions). These patterns did not
	conform to predictions from socioecological models.},

	Abstract = {Vertex betweenness centrality is a metric that seeks to quantify a sense
	of the importance of a vertex in a network in terms of its `control' on
	the flow of information along geodesic paths throughout the network. Two
	natural ways to extend vertex betweenness centrality to sets of vertices
	are (i) in terms of geodesic paths that pass through at least one of the
	vertices in the set, and (ii) in terms of geodesic paths that pass
	through all vertices in the set. The former was introduced by Everett
	and Borgatti {[}Everett, M., Borgatti, S., 1999. The centrality of
	groups and classes. journal of Mathematical Sociology 23 (3), 181-201],
	and called group betweenness centrality. The latter, which we call
	co-betweenness centrality here, has not been considered formally in the
	literature until now, to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we
	show that these two notions of centrality are in fact intimately related
	and, furthermore, that this relationship may be exploited to obtain
	deeper insight into both. In particular, we provide an expansion for
	group betweenness in terms of increasingly higher orders of
	co-betweenness, in a manner analogous to the Taylor series expansion of
	a mathematical function in calculus. We then demonstrate the utility of
	this expansion by using it to construct analytic lower and upper bounds
	for group betweenness that involve only simple combinations of (i) the
	betweenness of individual vertices in the group, and (ii) the
	co-betweenness of pairs of these vertices. Accordingly, we argue that
	the latter quantity, i.e., pairwise co-betweenness, is itself a
	fundamental quantity of some independent interest, and we present a
	computationally efficient algorithm for its calculation, which extends
	the algorithm of Brandes {[} Brandes, U., 2001. A faster algorithm for
	betweenness centrality. journal of Mathematical Sociology 25,1631 in a
	natural manner. Applications are provided throughout, using a handful of
	different communication networks, which serve to illustrate the way in

	Abstract = {Random and biased net theory, introduced by Rapoport and others in the
	1950s, is one of the earliest approaches to the formal modeling of
	social networks. In this theory, intended as a theory of large-scale
	networks, ties between nodes derive both from random and non-random
	events of connection. The non-random connections are postulated to arise
	through ``bias{''} events that incorporate known or suspected systematic
	tendencies in tie formation, such as, mutuality or reciprocity,
	transitivity or closure in triads, and homophily-the overrepresentation
	of ties between persons who share important socio-demographic attributes
	like race/ethnicity or level of educational attainment. A key problem
	for biased net theory has been analytical intractability of the models.
	Formal derivations require approximation assumptions and model
	parameters have been difficult to estimate. The accuracy of the derived
	formulas and the estimated parameters has been difficult to assess. In
	this paper, we attempt to address long-standing issues in biased net
	models stemming from their analytical intractability. We first
	reformulate and clarify the definitions of basic biases. Second, we
	derive from first principles the triad distribution in a biased net,
	using two different analytical strategies to check our derivations.
	Third, we set out a pseudo-likelihood method for parameter estimation of
	key bias parameters and then check the accuracy of this relatively
	simple but approximate scheme against the results obtained from the
	triad distribution derivation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

	important problem that occurs frequently in social science, public

	HIV/AIDS research because estimates of the sizes of the most at-risk
	populations-illicit drug users, men who have sex with men, and sex
	workers-are needed for designing, evaluating, and funding programs to
	curb the spread of the disease. A promising new approach in this area is
	the network scale-up method, which uses information about the personal

	intergenerational social closure promotes student achievement in high
	schools, analyzing the best national data on academic achievement and
	social networks: the 2002 and 2004 waves of the Education Longitudinal
	Study. The results show that within the Catholic school sector, schools
	that are characterized by dense parental networks have substantially
	higher average student achievement. This association can be reduced but
	not eliminated by conditioning on available measures of student network
	structure and standard measures of family background. In contrast, in
	the public school sector, a similarly strong bivariate association
	between dense parental networks and student achievement can be
	attributed almost entirely to these basic conditioning variables. These
	results represent, at best, a mixed verdict for Coleman's predictions.
	Intergenerational closure in its currently observed form does not
	increase achievement in public schools, suggesting that parental
	monitoring of discipline does not outweigh some of the costs of parental
	closure. However, intergenerational closure may increase achievement in
	Catholic schools to a modest degree because Catholic schools are
	affiliated with religious communities that have appropriable norms.},

	Acknowledging the need for realistic topologies and adoption behaviors
	backed by empirical measurements, it becomes unclear how accurately
	existing models render real-world phenomena: if indeed both topology and
	transmission mechanisms have a key impact on these phenomena, to which
	extent does the use of more or less stylized assumptions affect modeling
	results? In order to evaluate various classical topologies and
	mechanisms, we push the comparison to more empirical benchmarks:
	real-world network structures and empirically measured mechanisms.
	Special attention is paid to appraising the discrepancy between
	diffusion phenomena (i) on some real network topologies vs. various
	kinds of scale-free networks, and (ii) using an empirically-measured
	transmission mechanism, compared with canonical appropriate models such
	as threshold models. We find very sensible differences between the more
	realistic settings and their traditional stylized counterparts. On the
	whole, our point is thus also epistemological by insisting that models
	should be tested against simulation-based empirical benchmarks.},

	Abstract = {Background: Understanding the social environmental around obesity has

	similar gaps elsewhere is to use passively generated digital data.
	Purpose: This article explores the relationship between online social
	environment via web-based social networks and population obesity
	prevalence.
	Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study using linear regression
	and cross validation to measure the relationship and predictive
	performance of user interests on the online social network Facebook to
	obesity prevalence in metros across the United States of America (USA)
	and neighborhoods within New York City (NYC). The outcomes, proportion
	of obese and/or overweight population in USA metros and NYC
	neighborhoods, were obtained via the Centers for Disease Control and
	Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance and NYC EpiQuery systems.
	Predictors were geographically specific proportion of users with
	activity-related and sedentary-related interests on Facebook.
	Results: Higher proportion of the population with activity-related
	interests on Facebook was associated with a significant 12.0\% (95\%
	Confidence Interval (CI) 11.9 to 12.1) lower predicted prevalence of
	obese and/or overweight people across USA metros and 7.2\% (95\% CI: 6.8
	to 7.7) across NYC neighborhoods. Conversely, greater proportion of the
	population with interest in television was associated with higher
	prevalence of obese and/or overweight people of 3.9\% (95\% CI: 3.7 to
	4.0) (USA) and 27.5\% (95\% CI: 27.1 to 27.9, significant) (NYC). For
	activity-interests and national obesity outcomes, the average root mean
	square prediction error from 10-fold cross validation was comparable to
	the average root mean square error of a model developed using the entire
	data set.
	Conclusions: Activity-related interests across the USA and
	sedentary-related interests across NYC were significantly associated
	with obesity prevalence. Further research is needed to understand how
	the online social environment relates to health outcomes and how it can
	be used to identify or target interventions.},

	network structures emerge as a consequence of the conscious actions of
	actors. Motivated by the belief that ``networks matter{''} in reaching
	personal objectives, it is a natural assumption that actors try to
	optimize their network position. Starting from the notion that an
	optimal network position depends on the social context, we examine how
	actors change their networks to reach better positions in various
	contexts. Distinguishing between three social contexts (a neutral
	context, a context in which closed triads are costly, and a context in
	which closed triads are beneficial), theoretical results predict that
	emerging networks are contingent on the incentives that are present in
	these contexts. Experiments are used to test whether networks that are
	theoretically predicted to be stable are also stable experimentally. We
	find that emerging networks correspond to a large extent with the
	predicted networks. Consequently, they are contingent on the incentives
	present in various social contexts. In addition, we find that subjects
	tend to form specific stable networks with a higher probability than
	predicted, namely, efficient networks and networks in which everyone is
	equally well off. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Twitter and LiveJournal. Since empirical data cannot be directly mapped
	to ideal multi-source spreading, we leverage the behavioral patterns of
	users extracted from data to construct ``virtual{''} information
	spreading processes. Our results demonstrate that the set of spreaders
	selected by CI can induce larger scale of information propagation.
	Moreover, local measures as the number of connections or citations are
	not necessarily the deterministic factors of nodes' importance in
	realistic information spreading. This result has significance for
	rankings scientists in scientific networks like the APS, where the
	commonly used number of citations can be a poor indicator of the
	collective influence of authors in the community.},

	phases of the 15M movement in Spain, we perform the first large scale
	test of theories on collective emotions and social interaction in
	collective actions. Our findings show that activity and information
	cascades in the movement are larger in the presence of negative
	collective emotions and when users express themselves in terms related
	to social content. At the level of individual participants, our results
	show that their social integration in the movement, as measured through
	social network metrics, increases with their level of engagement and of

	among scholars as a way to describe immigrants' long-term maintenance of

	the overall proportion of immigrants who engage in transnational
	behavior is low and that, as a result, transnationalism has little
	sustained effect on the process of immigrant adaptation and
	assimilation. In this article, we argue that a key shortcoming in the
	current empirical debate on transnationalism is the lack of data on the
	social networks that connect migrants to each other and to nonmigrants
	in communities of origin. To address this shortcoming, our analysis uses
	unique binational data on the social network connecting an immigrant
	sending community in Guanajuato, Mexico, to two destination areas in the
	United States. We test for the effect of respondents' positions in
	cross-border networks on their migration intentions and attitudes
	towards the United States using data on the opinions of their peers,
	their participation in cross-border and local communication networks,
	and their structural position in the network. The results indicate
	qualified empirical support for a network-based model of

	of sampling and analyzing social networks with survey data. RDS is a
	network based sampling and analysis method that provides a middle ground
	compliment to ego-centric and saturated methods of social network
	analysis. The method provides survey data, similar to ego-centric
	approaches, on individuals who are connected by behaviorally documented
	ties, allowing for macro-level analysis of network structure, similar to
	that supported by saturated approaches. Using racial interaction of
	university undergraduates as an empirical example, the paper examines
	whether and to what extent racial diversity at the institutional level
	is reflected as racial integration at the interpersonal level by testing
	hypotheses regarding the quantity and quality of cross-race friendships.
	The primary goal of this article, however, is to introduce RDS to the
	network community and to stimulate further research toward the goal of
	expanding the analytical capacity of RDS. Advantages, limitations, and
	areas for future research to network analysis using RDS are discussed.

	In the present article it is argued that it is more natural to model

	Abstract = {Vaccine hesitancy is currently recognized by the WHO as a major threat
	to global health. Recently, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic,
	there has been a growing interest in the role of social media in the
	propagation of false information and fringe narratives regarding
	vaccination. Using a sample of approximately 60 billion tweets, we
	conduct a large-scale analysis of the vaccine discourse on Twitter. We
	use methods from deep learning and transfer learning to estimate the
	vaccine sentiments expressed in tweets, then categorize individual-level
	user attitude towards vaccines. Drawing on an interaction graph
	representing mutual interactions between users, we analyze the interplay
	between vaccine stances, interaction network, and the information
	sources shared by users in vaccine-related contexts. We find that
	strongly anti-vaccine users frequently share content from sources of a
	commercial nature; typically sources which sell alternative health
	products for profit. An interesting aspect of this finding is that
	concerns regarding commercial conflicts of interests are often cited as
	one of the major factors in vaccine hesitancy. Further, we show that the
	debate is highly polarized, in the sense that users with similar stances
	on vaccination interact preferentially with one another. Extending this
	insight, we provide evidence of an epistemic echo chamber effect, where
	users are exposed to highly dissimilar sources of vaccine information,
	depending the vaccination stance of their contacts. Our findings
	highlight the importance of understanding and addressing vaccine mis-
	and dis-information in the context in which they are disseminated in

	fraud investigators creatively exploit clients' social networks to
	extract such information, and thus use clients' social ties against
	them. Investigators gain some information through elective cooperation,

	ties' appropriability, through which they serve as resources for
	relational outsiders' interests. Repurposing welfare clients' social
	ties for fraud enforcement presents a two-fold threat to subsistence and
	social mobility prospects: it imposes punishments-including program
	disqualifications-while simultaneously damaging social support networks.
	These enforcement practices reveal appropriability as an unrecognized

	Abstract = {Identifying the factors that influence academic performance is an
	essential part of educational research. Previous studies have documented
	the importance of personality traits, class attendance, and social
	network structure. Because most of these analyses were based on a single
	behavioral aspect and/or small sample sizes, there is currently no
	quantification of the interplay of these factors. Here, we study the
	academic performance among a cohort of 538 undergraduate students
	forming a single, densely connected social network. Our work is based on
	data collected using smartphones, which the students used as their
	primary phones for two years. The availability of multi-channel data
	from a single population allows us to directly compare the explanatory
	power of individual and social characteristics. We find that the most
	informative indicators of performance are based on social ties and that
	network indicators result in better model performance than individual
	characteristics (including both personality and class attendance). We
	confirm earlier findings that class attendance is the most important
	predictor among individual characteristics. Finally, our results suggest
	the presence of strong homophily and/or peer effects among university
	students.},

	Abstract = {Most individuals in social networks experience a so-called Friendship
	Paradox: they are less popular than their friends on average. This
	effect may explain recent findings that widespread social network media
	use leads to reduced happiness. However the relation between popularity
	and happiness is poorly understood. A Friendship paradox does not
	necessarily imply a Happiness paradox where most individuals are less
	happy than their friends. Here we report the first direct observation of
	a significant Happiness Paradox in a large-scale online social network
	of 39,110 Twitter users. Our results reveal that popular individuals are
	indeed happier and that a majority of individuals experience a
	significant Happiness paradox. The magnitude of the latter effect is
	shaped by complex interactions between individual popularity, happiness,
	and the fact that users strongly cluster by similar level of happiness.
	Our results indicate that the topology of online social networks,
	combined with how happiness is distributed in some populations, may be
	associated with significant psycho-social effects.},

	Abstract = {Bootstrap percolation is a general representation of some networked

	Inspired by some recent findings on spatial structure of online social
	networks, here we study bootstrap percolation on undirected spatial
	networks, with the probability density function of long-range links'
	lengths being a power law with tunable exponent. Setting the size of the
	giant active component as the order parameter, we find a
	parameter-dependent critical value for the power-law exponent, above
	which there is a double phase transition, mixed of a second-order phase
	transition and a hybrid phase transition with two varying critical
	points, otherwise there is only a second-order phase transition. We
	further find a parameter-independent critical value around -1, about
	which the two critical points for the double phase transition are almost
	constant. To our surprise, this critical value -1 is just equal or very
	close to the values of many real online social networks, including
	LiveJournal, HP Labs email network, Belgian mobile phone network, etc.

	Abstract = {In the social mobility literature, the position generator (PG) has been
	used to examine the relationship between the structural location of
	individuals. and outcomes such as obtaining a high status job. Diversity
	of occupational ties (as measured by the PG) is also a significant
	predictor of an individual's cultural capital. A great deal of work has
	also been done in the field of social movements examining the
	relationship between networks and mobilization. However, only limited
	attention has been given to the position generator in this literature.
	Also, while past research has demonstrated that prior network ties to
	activists is one of the most important predictors of current activism,
	relatively little research has been devoted to examining network
	structure as an outcome of activism. The present paper builds upon these
	insights by utilizing data collected with the position generator on a
	sample of environmental movement members, and examining the relationship
	between individual activism (as an independent variable) and diversity
	of occupational ties (as a dependent variable). The result of key
	theoretical significance is that those who are more active in the
	environmental movement develop a greater diversity of occupational ties
	to other environmentalists. Results suggest that this process occurs
	over time. These findings provide evidence that social capital (as
	indicated by network diversity) is one outcome of social movement
	mobilization. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {In opportunistic complex networks, information transmission between

	we propose a low-latency broadcast algorithm for opportunistic complex
	networks based on successive interference cancellation techniques to
	improve propagation delay. With this kind of algorithm, when the social
	network is broadcasting, this algorithm analyzes whether the conditions
	for successive interference cancellation are satisfied between the
	broadcast links on the assigned transmission time slice. If the
	conditions are met, they are scheduled at the same time slice, and
	interference avoidance scheduling is performed when conditions are not

	Abstract = {The issue of human subject protection in relation to social network
	research on the spread and control of human pathogens is considered. As
	this area derives most of its concepts and methods from social network
	analysis more generally, the present discussion has wider relevance. One
	problem is that some Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) have assumed
	that if a participant (who gave informed consent) is to be asked to name
	network associates these too - automatically - would be human subjects
	from whom informed consent also must be obtained. Invariably, if this
	occurs proposed research - whatever its funding and potential
	contributions might be - is blocked. A conservative approach is taken
	here. The Common Rule is assumed to provide relevant guidance, the
	responsibility of IRBs is to make decisions based on the Common Rule,
	and in consequence the burden is on those proposing social network
	research to design - and defend - their planned work with this in mind.
	At the same time, it is argued that it is important not to stifle
	beneficial research by adding to one inherently conservative review
	process (of grant proposals) another (of IRBs) so that work is prevented
	simply because it is research at the frontiers rather than `safe'

	this aspect of heterogeneity, as well as dependence of dyads, can easily

	Abstract = {Capturing heterogeneity in contact patterns in animal populations is
	essential for understanding the spread of infectious diseases. In
	contrast to other regions of the world in which livestock movement
	networks are integral to pathogen prevention and control policies,
	contact networks are understudied in pastoral regions of Africa due to
	the challenge of measuring contact among mobile herds of cattle whose
	movements are driven by access to resources. Furthermore, the extent to
	which seasonal changes in the distribution of water and resources
	impacts the structure of contact networks in cattle is uncertain.
	Contact networks may be more conducive to pathogen spread in the dry
	season due to congregation at limited water sources. Alternatively, less
	abundant forage may result in decreased pathogen transmission due to
	competitive avoidance among herds, as measured by reduced contact rates.
	Here, we use GPS technology to concurrently track 49 free-roaming cattle
	herds within a semi-arid region of Kenya, and use these data to
	characterize seasonal contact networks and model the spread of a highly
	infectious pathogen. This work provides the first empirical data on the
	local contact network structure of mobile herds based on quantifiable
	contact events. The contact network demonstrated high levels of
	interconnectivity. An increase in contacts near to water resources in
	the dry season resulted in networks with both higher contact rates and
	higher potential for pathogen spread than in the wet season. Simulated
	disease outbreaks were also larger in the dry season. Results support
	the hypothesis that limited water resources enhance connectivity and
	transmission within contact networks, as opposed to reducing
	connectivity as a result of competitive avoidance. These results cast
	light on the impact of seasonal heterogeneity in resource availability
	on predicting pathogen transmission dynamics, which has implications for
	other free-ranging wild and domestic populations.},

	Abstract = {There is a growing body of literature positively linking dimensions of
	social capital to economic benefits. Yet recent research also points to
	a potential ``dark side{''} of social capital, where over-embeddedness
	in networks and the pressures associated with brokerage are hypothesized
	to constrain actors, having a negative effect on economic outcomes. This
	dichotomy suggests that context is important, yet the overwhelming
	majority of existing empirical evidence stems from socially homogenous
	populations in corporate and organizational settings, limiting a broader
	understanding of when and how context matters. We advance this discourse
	to a socially fragmented, ethnically diverse common-pool resource system
	where information is highly valuable and competition is fierce. Merging
	several unique datasets from Hawaii's pelagic tuna fishery, we find that
	network prominence, i.e., being well connected locally, has a
	significant, positive effect on economic productivity. In contrast, we
	find that brokerage, defined here as ties that bridge either
	structurally distinct or ethnically distinct groups, has a significant,
	negative effect. Taken together, our results provide empirical support
	to widespread claims of the value of information access in common-pool
	resource systems, yet suggest that in ethnically diverse, competitive
	environments, brokers may be penalized for sharing information across
	social divides. Our results thus contribute to an emerging theory on the
	fragile nature of brokerage that recognizes its potential perils and the

	more likely to first hear and react to news shared by their social ties

	33 females) into their neighborhood is measured quantitatively by a
	Vernacular Culture Index (VCI) constructed from the respondents'
	responses to 10 statements, each with values ranging from 1 to 4.  The
	speech behaviors of these respondents with respect to variants of six
	linguistic variables (each with a black English {[}BE] and a colloquial
	Standard English variant) are quantified and the statistical
	relationships between the VCI scores and linguistic behavior are

	older age groups (40-59, 60+) are more likely to choose BE variants than
	respondents in the younger age groups (18-25, 26-39), and that there are
	consistent statistically significant correlations between high scores on
	the VCI and the choice of BE variants of the linguistic variables.  This
	is taken to support the proposal that the Social Network Theory

	individual and collective interests. Indeed, the ability to seek out
	cooperative others is a key explanation for the high levels of
	cooperation observed in social life. In contrast to existing research on
	cooperation and networks, sorting in the real world is typically driven
	by homophily, or similarity on socially significant attributes like
	ethnicity or religion. Here the authors develop and test an argument
	about how homophily alters network dynamics and cooperation using a
	large web-based experiment and an agent-based model. They find that
	homophily promotes cooperation, net of key determinants of cooperation.
	Further, homophily drives the selection of new ties, increasing
	clustering in dynamic networks. The authors also demonstrate the
	consequences of in-group preferences for between-group segregation.
	Their results therefore shed light on how cooperation can evolve in
	networks and how this process contributes to network-level segregation.},

	interventions can aim at providing contact opportunities in school
	settings to prevent the social isolation of individuals and facilitate
	integration between otherwise segregated social groups. We investigate
	the short-term and long-term effects of one specific network
	intervention in an undergraduate cohort freshly admitted to an
	engineering department (N=226). In this intervention, we randomly
	assigned students into small groups at an introduction event two months
	prior to their first day at university. The groups were designed to

	mixed-gender friendships in pairs of students who were assigned to the
	same group than in pairs from different groups (short-term effects).
	These effects gradually diminish over the first academic year (long-term
	effects). Using stochastic actor-oriented models, we investigate the
	long-term trajectory of the intervention effects, while considering
	alternative network processes, such as reciprocity, transitivity,
	homophily, and popularity. The results suggest that even though the
	induced friendship ties are less stable than other friendships, they may
	serve as early seeds for complex social network processes. Our study
	shows that simple network interventions can have a pronounced short-term
	effect and indirect long-term effects on the evolution and structure of

	significant research efforts; Lawrence gi Lorsch's (1967) demonstration
	that the optimum form of organization varies between markets, and Kotter
	and Heskett's (1992) study of corporate culture and performance. We
	compare firms in terms of their economic performance, the extent to
	which they have a strong corporate culture, and the network structure of
	their market. The value of a strong corporate culture varies between
	markets; nothing in one market, an asset in more competitive markets.
	From the variation between markets, we build a culture-performance
	contingency function that uses the network structure of a firm's market
	to predict the extent to which a strong corporate culture can be
	expected to enhance the firm's performance. With the contingency
	function, and market census data, we infer that the correlation between
	culture and performance is strong in the American economy, especially in
	manufacturing. We also use the function to identify reasonable samples
	of organizations in which the correlation will be weak, The contingency
	function is an interesting substantive phenomenon in its own right and a

	yet evidence for homophily (being friends with similar others) based on
	self-reported personality is inconsistent. Functional
	connectomes-patterns of spontaneous synchronization across the brain-are
	stable within individuals and predict how people tend to think and
	behave. Thus, they may capture interindividual variability in latent
	traits that are particularly similar among friends but that might elude
	self-report. Here, we examined interpersonal similarity in functional
	connectivity at rest-that is, in the absence of external stimuli-and
	tested if functional connectome similarity is associated with proximity
	in a real-world social network. The social network of a remote village
	was reconstructed; a subset of residents underwent functional magnetic
	resonance imaging. Similarity in functional connectomes was positively
	related to social network proximity, particularly in the default mode
	network. Controlling for similarities in demographic and personality
	data (the Big Five personality traits) yielded similar results. Thus,
	functional connectomes may capture latent interpersonal similarities
	between friends that are not fully captured by commonly used demographic
	or personality measures. The localization of these results suggests how
	friendsmay be particularly similar to one another. Additionally,
	geographic proximity moderated the relationship between neural
	similarity and social network proximity, suggesting that such
	associations are particularly strong among people who live particularly
	close to one another. These findings suggest that social connectivity is
	reflected in signatures of brain functional connectivity, consistent
	with the common intuition that friends share similarities that go
	beyond, for example, demographic similarities.},

	Here we show that acquaintance algorithms, i.e., selecting neighbors of

	fragmenting all networks than targeting well-established community
	roles, i.e., health workers, village government members, and
	schoolteachers. Additionally, community roles were not good proxy

	many sick people. We also show that acquaintance algorithms were
	effective in offsetting potential noncompliance with deworming
	treatments for 16,357 individuals during mass drug administration (MDA).
	Health advice networks were destroyed more easily than friendship
	networks. Only an average of 32\% of nodes were removed from health
	advice networks to reduce the percentage of nodes at risk for refusing
	treatment in MDA to below 25\%. Treatment compliance of at least 75\% is

	structural measures, an extensive consideration of homophily, and
	investigation of status difference between egos and alters. We found

	We also found that domestic interaction name generators yielded the most

	Participants were generally more likely to nominate those of higher
	social status, although certain questions, such as who participants talk
	to uncovered more egalitarian relationships, while other name generators
	elicited the names of social contacts distinctly higher or lower in
	status than the respondent. Some questions also seemed to uncover

	connect to the opposite gender. A particularly marked gender difference
	emerges in signing up for the social networking service and adding the
	first friends, and in the interactions by means of wall messages. In
	these contexts we find evidence of a strong homophily for women, and
	little or no homophily for men. By examining the gender composition of
	triangle motifs, we observe a marked tendency of users to group into

	react to the information, which can help those who need to respond to

	spreading quicker then ever before, and in qualitatively different ways,
	since people no longer need to be in face-to-face contact or even know
	each other to pass on information in an crisis situation. Social media
	also provides a wealth of data about this information diffusion since
	much of the communication happening within this platform is publicly
	viewable. This data trove provides researchers with unique information
	that can be examined and modeled in order to understand urgent
	diffusion. A robust model of urgent diffusion on social media would be
	useful to any stakeholders who are interested in responding to a crisis
	situation. In this paper, we present two models, grounded in social
	theory, that provide insight into urgent diffusion dynamics on social
	networks using agent-based modeling. We then explore data collected from
	Twitter during four major urgent diffusion events including: (1) the
	capture of Osama Bin Laden, (2) Hurricane Irene, (3) Hurricane Sandy,
	and (4) Election Night 2012. We illustrate the diffusion of information
	during these events using network visualization techniques, showing that
	there appear to be differences. After that, we fit the agent-based
	models to the observed empirical data. The results show that the models
	fit qualitatively similarly, but the diffusion patterns of these events
	are indeed quite different from each other.},

	present an analysis of the structural determinants of inefficiency. We
	employ a formal model of collective action developed by Coleman (1973,
	1990); link it to the Markov model of interpersonal influence developed

	Friedkin and Johnsen 1990); and extend it to measure inefficiency in
	information flow based on the concept of mean first passage times. It is
	shown that structural characteristics of social networks - such as
	global density, local density, diameter, number of bridges, and
	inequality in centrality, and certain interactions among these variables
	- strongly affect inefficiency. Theoretical implications of the results
	are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Background
	Digital spaces, and in particular social networking sites, are becoming
	increasingly present and influential in the functioning of our
	democracies. In this paper, we propose an integrated methodology for the
	data collection, the reconstruction, the analysis and the visualization
	of the development of a country's political landscape from Twitter data.
	Method
	The proposed method relies solely on the interactions between Twitter
	accounts and is independent of the characteristics of the shared
	contents such as the language of the tweets. We validate our methodology
	on a case study on the 2017 French presidential election (60 million
	Twitter exchanges between more than 2.4 million users) via two
	independent methods: the comparison between our automated political
	categorization and a human categorization based on the evaluation of a
	sample of 5000 profiles descriptions; the correspondence between the
	reconfigurations detected in the reconstructed political landscape and
	key political events reported in the media. This latter validation
	demonstrated the ability of our approach to accurately reflect the
	reconfigurations at play in the off-line political scene.
	Results
	We built on this reconstruction to give insights into the opinion
	dynamics and the reconfigurations of political communities at play
	during a presidential election. First, we propose a quantitative
	description and analysis of the political engagement of members of
	political communities. Second, we analyze the impact of political
	communities on information diffusion and in particular on their role in
	the fake news phenomena. We measure a differential echo chamber effect
	on the different types of political news (fake news, debunks, standard
	news) caused by the community structure and emphasize the importance of
	addressing the meso-structures of political networks in understanding
	the fake news phenomena.
	Conclusions
	Giving access to an intermediate level, between sociological surveys in
	the field and large statistical studies (such as those conducted by
	national or international organizations) we demonstrate that social
	networks data make it possible to qualify and quantify the activity of
	political communities in a multi-polar political environment; as well as
	their temporal evolution and reconfiguration, their structure, their
	alliance strategies and their semantic particularities during a
	presidential campaign through the analysis of their digital traces. We
	conclude this paper with a comment on the political and ethical
	implications of the use of social networks data in politics. We stress
	the importance of developing social macroscopes that will enable
	citizens to better understand how they collectively make society and
	propose as example the ``Politoscope{''}, a macroscope that delivers
	some of our results in an interactive way.},

	Abstract = {Background: Language has functions that transcend the transmission of
	information and varies with social context. To find out how language and
	social network structure interlink, we studied communication on Twitter,
	a broadly-used online messaging service.
	Results: We show that the network emerging from user communication can
	be structured into a hierarchy of communities, and that the frequencies
	of words used within those communities closely replicate this pattern.
	Consequently, communities can be characterised by their most
	significantly used words. The words used by an individual user, in turn,
	can be used to predict the community of which that user is a member.
	Conclusions: This indicates a relationship between human language and
	social networks, and suggests that the study of online communication
	offers vast potential for understanding the fabric of human society. Our
	approach can be used for enriching community detection with word
	analysis, which provides the ability to automate the classification of
	communities in social networks and identify emerging social groups.},

	mapping, analyzing and modeling the spatial structure of a large
	interfirm competition network across a variety of sectors and industries
	within the United States. We propose two micro-dynamic models that are
	able to reproduce empirically observed characteristics of competition
	networks as a natural outcome of a minimal set of general mechanisms
	governing the formation of competition networks. Both models, which
	utilize different approaches yet apply common principles to network
	formation give comparable results. There is an asymmetry between
	companies that are considered competitors, and companies that consider
	others as their competitors. All companies only consider a small number
	of other companies as competitors; however, there are a few companies
	that are considered as competitors by many others. Geographically, the
	density of corporate headquarters strongly correlates with local
	population density, and the probability two firms are competitors
	declines with geographic distance. We construct these properties by
	growing a corporate network with competitive links using random
	incorporations modulated by population density and geographic distance.

	Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on every human activity and, because
	of the urgency of finding the proper responses to such an unprecedented
	emergency, it generated a diffused societal debate. The online version
	of this discussion was not exempted by the presence of misinformation
	campaigns, but, differently from what already witnessed in other
	debates, the COVID-19 -intentional or not- flow of false information put
	at severe risk the public health, possibly reducing the efficacy of
	government countermeasures. In this manuscript, we study the effective
	impact of misinformation in the Italian societal debate on Twitter
	during the pandemic, focusing on the various discursive communities. In
	order to extract such communities, we start by focusing on verified
	users, i.e., accounts whose identity is officially certified by Twitter.
	We start by considering each couple of verified users and count how many
	unverified ones interacted with both of them via tweets or retweets: if
	this number is statically significant, i.e. so great that it cannot be
	explained only by their activity on the online social network, we can
	consider the two verified accounts as similar and put a link connecting
	them in a monopartite network of verified users. The discursive
	communities can then be found by running a community detection algorithm
	on this network. We observe that, despite being a mostly scientific
	subject, the COVID-19 discussion shows a clear division in what results
	to be different political groups. We filter the network of retweets from
	random noise and check the presence of messages displaying URLs. By
	using the well known browser extension NewsGuard, we assess the
	trustworthiness of the most recurrent news sites, among those tweeted by
	the political groups. The impact of low reputable posts reaches the
	22.1\% in the right and center-right wing community and its contribution
	is even stronger in absolute numbers, due to the activity of this group:
	96\% of all non reputable URLs shared by political groups come from this
	community.},

	integrated into the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS)
	epidemic model. In this paper, firstly, the SIRS epidemic model and the
	factors of relationship strength are introduced based on the J-A model
	(proposed by Jager and Amblard) to enhance the information transmission
	and interaction among individuals. In addition, the BA network (proposed
	by Barabasi and Albert) model is used as the agent adjacency model due
	to its closeness to the real social network structure. After that, the
	Monte Carlo method is applied to conduct experimental simulation.
	Subsequently, this paper analyzes the simulation results in threefold:
	(1) comparison of polarization processes with and without integration of
	the SIRS epidemic model; (2) adjusting the immune recovery parameter
	gamma and the relationship strengthzto explore the role of these two
	parameters in the polarization process; and (3) comparing the
	polarization effects of different network structures. Through the
	experiments, we find that BA network is more polarized than small-world
	network in the same scale. Finally, corresponding measures are proposed
	to prevent and mitigate the occurrence of group polarization.},

	Abstract = {Opinion polarization in online social networks causes a lot of concerns
	on its social, economic, and political impacts, and is becoming an
	important topic for academic research. Based on the system theory, a
	theoretical framework on analyzing opinion polarization combining big
	data analytics capabilities (BDAC) is proposed. A web crawler is used to
	collect data from the Sina Weibo platform on the topic of
	``Tangping{''}. Concerning the characteristics of the big data
	environment, social network analysis (SNA), machine learning, text
	clustering and content analysis are used to mine opinion polarization of

	the same opinion indicate the phenomenon of aggregation. Although no
	influential users support the opinion of ``Tangping{''} on Weibo, a high
	percentage of people advocate the idea. The supporting group has the
	most clusters while the opposing group has the highest density of
	keywords. The research contributes to the existing literature on
	applying BDAC to analyze online polarization from the perspective of the
	system from user behavior and interaction to topic clustering and
	keywords identification. The conceptual system framework shows
	superiority in the integration of information coordination of

	Abstract = {The marginalised rural communities are characterised by societal
	challenges, such as isolation, lack of job opportunities, land
	abandonment, low quality of life and generally low education. Social
	Innovation (SI) initiatives may represent an opportunity to strengthen
	relationships among the members of rural community, by means of the
	alteration of the existing social networks. In this way, more exchange
	of information is expected, paving the way for the creation of
	professional collaborations among firms and other actors. This paper
	aims at proposing a short-term evaluation framework of effectiveness of
	a SI initiative in terms of reconfiguration of the social network
	structure. The described empirical case study is VaZapp', a rural hub
	located in Southern Italy, which provides innovative solutions to
	activate social relations amongst farmers, altering hence their network.
	A well-referenced SI theoretical model, developed within the H2020
	project SIMRA (Social Innovation in Marginalised Rural Areas), and the
	methodology of Social Network Analysis (SNA) were used to verify and
	measure quantitative and qualitative indicators affected by network
	intervention activated by VaZapp' initiative. Results show that this SI
	initiative worked effectively, leading to a +308\% in the number of
	relations and +250\% in social network density. In addition, an evident
	improvement in the quality of the social relations was found, especially
	in cases where there are direct engagements within VaZapp'. Outcomes
	suggest that supporting and promoting SI initiatives could become a
	central discussion point for the rethinking of rural development
	policies focused on regeneration of social relations' structure.},

	the chance of forming associations between previously innocuous events
	(e.g., being in a subway station) and aversive outcomes (e.g., footage
	or verbal reports from a violent terrorist attack) without direct
	experience. Such social threat, or fear, learning can have dramatic
	consequences, as manifested in acute stress symptoms and maladaptive
	fears. However, most research has so far focused on socially acquired
	threat responses that are expressed as increased arousal rather than
	active behavior. In three experiments (n = 120), we examined the effect
	of indirect experiences on behaviors by establishing a link between
	social threat learning and instrumental decision making. We contrasted
	learning from direct experience (i.e., Pavlovian conditioning)
	(experiment 1) against two common forms of social threat learning-social
	observation (experiment 2) and verbal instruction (experiment 3)-and how
	this learning transferred to subsequent instrumental decision making
	using behavioral experiments and computational modeling. We found that
	both types of social threat learning transfer to decision making in a
	strong and surprisingly inflexible manner. Notably, computational
	modeling indicated that the transfer of observational and instructed
	threat learning involved different computational mechanisms. Our results
	demonstrate the strong influence of others' expressions of fear on one's

	healthy and pathological human behaviors resulting from the indirect

	with respect to the aetiology of social support. These individuals are
	experiencing many major life changes and social support can help them
	adjust to the associated environmental stressors of this time. Using
	1,215 18-year-old twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study, we
	collected measures of two indices of support: support quality and
	support quantity, as well as wellbeing and depression. Both support
	indices were moderately heritable (55\% and 49\%, respectively), an
	interesting finding given the many environmental changes that late
	adolescents are encountering that could be environmentally altering
	their social network structures. Finding a genetic influence on support
	suggests the presence of gene-environment correlation whereby
	individuals create and perceive their supportive environment based upon
	their genetic predispositions. Shared genetic influences mediated the
	moderate phenotypic correlation (mean r = 0.46) between support and
	mental health. Genetic correlations were higher between support quality
	and mental health (mean rA = 0.75), than between support quantity and
	mental health (mean rA = 0.54), reflecting the phenotypic pattern. This

	Month = {MAY},
	Abstract = {In most domains of network analysis researchers consider networks that
	arise in nature with weighted edges. Such networks are routinely
	dichotomized in the interest of using available methods for statistical
	inference with networks. The generalized exponential random graph model
	(GERGM) is a recently proposed method used to simulate and model the
	edges of a weighted graph. The GERGM specifies a joint distribution for
	an exponential family of graphs with continuous-valued edge weights.
	However, current estimation algorithms for the GERGM only allow
	inference on a restricted family of model specifications. To address
	this issue, we develop a Metropolis-Hastings method that can be used to
	estimate any GERGM specification, thereby significantly extending the
	family of weighted graphs that can be modeled with the GERGM. We show
	that new flexible model specifications are capable of avoiding
	likelihood degeneracy and efficiently capturing network structure in
	applications where such models were not previously available. We
	demonstrate the utility of this new class of GERGMs through application
	to two real network data sets, and we further assess the effectiveness
	of our proposed methodology by simulating non-degenerate model
	specifications from the well-studied two-stars model. A working R
	version of the GERGM code is available in the supplement and is
	incorporated in the GERGM CRAN package. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

	Results of our investigation suggest that in disasters the rate of

	Our analysis also shows that inter-organizational coordination network

	Abstract = {One of the famous results of network science states that networks with
	heterogeneous connectivity are more susceptible to epidemic spreading
	than their more homogeneous counterparts. In particular, in networks of
	identical nodes it has been shown that network heterogeneity, i.e. a
	broad degree distribution, can lower the epidemic threshold at which
	epidemics can invade the system. Network heterogeneity can thus allow
	diseases with lower transmission probabilities to persist and spread.
	However, it has been pointed out that networks in which the properties
	of nodes are intrinsically heterogeneous can be very resilient to
	disease spreading. Heterogeneity in structure can enhance or diminish
	the resilience of networks with heterogeneous nodes, depending on the
	correlations between the topological and intrinsic properties. Here, we
	consider a plausible scenario where people have intrinsic differences in
	susceptibility and adapt their social network structure to the presence
	of the disease. We show that the resilience of networks with
	heterogeneous connectivity can surpass those of networks with
	homogeneous connectivity. For epidemiology, this implies that network
	heterogeneity should not be studied in isolation, it is instead the
	heterogeneity of infection risk that determines the likelihood of

	through heterogeneous social networks. In earlier models, when

	because it allows a transmitter of information to retain that
	information after telling it to somebody else. Consequently, the new
	model allows more actors to have information during the information
	diffusion process. The model provides predictions of diffusion times in
	a given network at the global, dyadic, and individual levels. This leads
	to straight forward generalizations of network measures, such as
	closeness centrality and betweenness centrality, for research problems
	that focus on the efficiency of information transfer in a network. We
	analyze in detail how information diffusion rimes and centrality
	measures depend an a series of network measures, such as degrees and
	bridges. One important finding is that predictions about the time actors
	need to spread information in the network differ considerably between
	the new and old models, while the predictions about the time needed to I
	receive information hardly differ. Finally, some cautionary remarks are
	made about using the model in empirical research.},

	beliefs about intergroup hostility. Using a Twitter field survey, we
	measured authors' moral outrage in real time and compared authors'
	reports to observers' judgements of the authors' moral outrage. We find
	that observers systematically overperceive moral outrage in authors,
	inferring more intense moral outrage experiences from messages than the
	authors of those messages actually reported. This effect was stronger in
	participants who spent more time on social media to learn about
	politics. Preregistered confirmatory behavioural experiments found that
	overperception of individuals' moral outrage causes overperception of
	collective moral outrage and inflates beliefs about hostile
	communication norms, group affective polarization and ideological
	extremity. Together, these results highlight how individual-level
	overperceptions of online moral outrage produce collective
	overperceptions that have the potential to warp our social knowledge of
	moral and political attitudes.

	Several potential intervening mechanisms underlying this social
	contagion effect were tested. First, evidence was found for

	supported the notion of social opportunity costs in that the anticipated

	positive impact on both fertility intentions and behavior. Panel
	regression models relying on intraindividtal change scores showed that

	dynamics has a long history in sociology and social psychology. However,
	the effects of endogenous group change on interaction dynamics are a
	surprisingly understudied area. One way to explore these relationships
	is through social network models. Network dynamics may be viewed as a
	process of change in the edge structure of a network, in the vertex set
	on which edges are defined, or in both simultaneously. Although early
	studies of such processes were primarily descriptive, recent work on
	this topic has increasingly turned to formal statistical models.
	Although showing great promise, many of these modern dynamic models are
	computationally intensive and scale very poorly in the size of the
	network under study and/or the number of time points considered.
	Likewise, currently used models focus on edge dynamics, with little
	support for endogenously changing vertex sets. Here, the authors show
	how an existing approach based on logistic network regression can be
	extended to serve as a highly scalable framework for modeling large
	networks with dynamic vertex sets. The authors place this approach
	within a general dynamic exponential family (exponential-family random
	graph modeling) context, clarifying the assumptions underlying the
	framework (and providing a clear path for extensions), and they show how
	model assessment methods for cross-sectional networks can be extended to
	the dynamic case. Finally, the authors illustrate this approach on a
	classic data set involving interactions among windsurfers on a
	California beach.},

	the sensitivity of the individual-based model was consistent across

	Rather, homophily is an endogenous product of the emergent exchange
	process, in which actors seek high-value partners who reciprocate their
	gestures. Whereas all actors initially direct exchange toward higher
	value partners, the gestures of lower value actors are more likely to go
	unreciprocated. This imbalance drives lower value actors to seek new
	partners, who end up being others who are also lower value. The
	consequence is homophily on value despite no such preference. I draw
	upon social exchange theory to articulate how this process unfolds in a
	newly forming network. A laboratory experiment tests hypotheses about
	how exchange patterns change over time. Findings reveal that shifts in
	participants' behavior over time were consistent with a concern for

	It is widely believed that information spread on social media is a
	percolation process, with parallels to phase transitions in theoretical
	physics. However, evidence for this hypothesis is limited, as phase
	transitions have not been directly observed in any social media. Here,
	through an analysis of 100 million Weibo and 40 million Twitter users,
	we identify percolation-like spread and find that it happens more
	readily than current theoretical models would predict. The lower
	percolation threshold can be explained by the existence of positive
	feedback in the coevolution between network structure and user activity
	level, such that more-active users gain more followers. Moreover, this
	coevolution induces an extreme imbalance in users' influence. Our
	findings indicate that the ability of information to spread across

	Abstract = {It is widely assumed that as populations become more market integrated
	the `inner circles' of people's social networks become less densely
	connected and family-oriented. This `loosening' of kin networks may
	fundamentally alter the social dynamics of reproduction, facilitating
	demographic transitions to low fertility. Few data exist to test this
	hypothesis. Previous research in urbanized populations has not
	explicitly measured kin density in ego-networks, nor assessed how market
	integration influences network structure at different levels of
	aggregation. Here I analyze the ego-networks of similar to 2000 women in
	22 rural Polish communities transitioning from subsistence farming to
	market-dependence. I compare how ego-network size, density and kin
	density co-vary with household and community-level market integration.
	Market integration is associated with less kin-dense networks, but not
	necessarily less dense ones, and is unrelated to network size. Declining
	kin density during economic transitions may be a critical mechanism for
	the broader cultural transmission of low fertility values. Market
	integration may loosen the dense kinship networks maintaining high
	fertility among agriculturalists, but data are lacking. Here, Colleran
	shows that in 22 rural Polish communities, women's ego networks are less
	kin-oriented, but not less dense, as market integration increases,
	potentially enabling low fertility values to spread.},

	Abstract = {Human activity follows an approximately 24-hour day-night cycle, but

	Individuals with circadian rhythms at the extremes can be categorized
	into two chronotypes: larks, those who wake up and go to sleep early,
	and owls, those who stay up and wake up late. It is well established
	that a person's chronotype can affect their activities and health.
	However, less is known about the effects of chronotypes on social
	behavior, even though many social interactions require coordinated
	timings. To study how chronotypes relate to social behavior, we use data
	collected with a smartphone app on a population of more than seven
	hundred volunteer students to simultaneously determine their chronotypes
	and social network structure. We find that owls maintain larger personal
	networks, albeit with less time spent per contact. On average, owls are
	more central in the social network of students than larks, frequently
	occupying the dense core of the network. These results point out that

	Volume = {11},

	Abstract = {The dynamical process of epidemic spreading has drawn much attention of
	the complex network community. In the network paradigm, diseases spread
	from one person to another through the social ties amongst the
	population. There are a variety of factors that govern the processes of
	disease spreading on the networks. A common but not negligible factor is
	people's reaction to the outbreak of epidemics. Such reaction can be
	related information dissemination or self-protection. In this work, we
	explore the interactions between disease spreading and population
	response in terms of information diffusion and individuals' alertness.
	We model the system by mapping multiplex networks into two-layer
	networks and incorporating individuals' risk awareness, on the
	assumption that their response to the disease spreading depends on the
	size of the community they belong to. By comparing the final incidence
	of diseases in multiplex networks, we find that there is considerable
	mitigation of diseases spreading for full phase of spreading speed when
	individuals' protection responses are introduced. Interestingly, the
	degree of community overlap between the two layers is found to be
	critical factor that affects the final incidence. We also analyze the
	consequences of the epidemic incidence in communities with different
	sizes and the impacts of community overlap between two layers.
	Specifically, as the diseases information makes individuals alert and
	take measures to prevent the diseases, the effective protection is more
	striking in small community. These phenomena can be explained by the
	multiplexity of the networked system and the competition between two
	spreading processes.},

	Abstract = {Direct advertising-sending promotional messages to individual
	customers-is increasingly used by marketers as a result of the recent
	improvements in consumer reachability. Most current methods to calculate
	optimal budgets for such advertising campaigns consider customers in
	isolation and ignore word-of-mouth communication (WOM). When the
	customer base forms a network (as is the case in telecom or social
	network databases) ignoring WOM clearly leads to suboptimal advertising
	budgets. This paper develops a model to help address this challenge. We
	assume that firms know the network structure formed by customers but do
	not know (or are not allowed to use) data on individuals' connections.
	Under this scenario, we compare the optimal campaign of a monopolist to
	that of firms competing in simultaneous-move or sequential-move games.
	The analysis provides two key insights: (i) we show that ignoring the
	existence of WOM leads to significant profit loss for firms and this is
	more so under competition. In particular, knowing the ``density{''} of
	consumer connections is crucial for the design of optimal campaigns.
	(ii) Competition in direct advertising exhibits strong first-mover
	advantages and, even in a simultaneous-move game between identical
	firms, highly asymmetric outcomes are possible. The paper also explores
	two extensions. First, we study the nature of the trade-off between
	increasing network size versus increasing the connectivity between
	existing network members. Second, we investigate how firms' advertising
	activity may endogenously grow the membership base.},

	Abstract = {The rate of adoption of new information depends on reinforcement from
	multiple sources in a way that often cannot be described by simple
	contagion processes. In such cases, contagion is said to be complex.
	Complex contagion happens in the diffusion of human behaviours,
	innovations and knowledge. Based on that evidence, we propose a model
	that considers multiple, potentially asymmetric and competing contagion
	processes and analyse its respective population-wide dynamics, bringing
	together ideas from complex contagion, opinion dynamics, evolutionary
	game theory and language competition by shifting the focus from
	individuals to the properties of the diffusing processes. We show that
	our model spans a dynamical space in which the population exhibits
	patterns of consensus, dominance, and, importantly, different types of
	polarization, a more diverse dynamical environment that contrasts with
	single simple contagion processes. We show how these patterns emerge and
	how different population structures modify them through a natural
	development of spatial correlations: structured interactions increase
	the range of the dominance regime by reducing that of dynamic
	polarization, tight modular structures can generate structural
	polarization, depending on the interplay between fundamental properties
	of the processes and the modularity of the interaction network.},

	Abstract = {Background
	Online social networking use has been integrated into adolescents' daily
	life and the intensity of online social networking use may have
	important consequences on adolescents' well-being. However, there are
	few validated instruments to measure social networking use intensity.
	The present study aims to develop the Social Networking Activity
	Intensity Scale (SNAIS) and validate it among junior middle school
	students in China.
	Methods
	A total of 910 students who were social networking users were recruited
	from two junior middle schools in Guangzhou, and 114 students were
	retested after two weeks to examine the test-retest reliability. The
	psychometrics of the SNAIS were estimated using appropriate statistical
	methods.
	Results
	Two factors, Social Function Use Intensity (SFUI) and Entertainment
	Function Use Intensity (EFUI), were clearly identified by both
	exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. No ceiling or floor
	effects were observed for the SNAIS and its two subscales. The SNAIS and
	its two subscales exhibited acceptable reliability (Cronbach's alpha =
	0.89, 0.90 and 0.60, and test-retest Intra-class Correlation Coefficient
	= 0.85, 0.87 and 0.67 for Overall scale, SFUI and EFUI subscale,
	respectively, p<0.001). As expected, the SNAIS and its subscale scores
	were correlated significantly with emotional connection to social
	networking, social networking addiction, Internet addiction, and
	characteristics related to social networking use.
	Conclusions
	The SNAIS is an easily self-administered scale with good psychometric
	properties. It would facilitate more research in this field worldwide
	and specifically in the Chinese population.},

	Therefore, video observation data of 149 pigs over three different age
	levels were investigated for 2 days each directly after mixing (65
	groups in the rearing area, 24 groups in the growing stable and 12
	groups in the breeding stable). The aim of the study was to use network
	analysis to investigate the development of individual network positions
	of specific animals and to determine whether centrality parameters in
	previous mixing situations have an impact on the future behavior of the
	animals. The results of the weighted degree centrality indicated that
	weaned pigs had a higher fighting intensity directly after mixing
	compared to growing pigs and gilts. Also, the number of different
	opponents (degree centrality) was higher compared to the older age
	groups. The betweenness centrality showed relatively small values and no
	significant differences between the different age levels, whereas the
	closeness centrality showed high values at all observed age levels.
	Experiences gained in previous agonistic interactions had an impact on
	the centrality parameters in subsequent mixing situations. It was shown
	that the position of individual animals in agonistic interaction
	networks can be characterized using social network analysis and that
	changes over different age levels can be detected. Therefore, social
	network analysis provides insights into the formation and evolution of
	behavioral patterns which could be of particular interest for the

	roosting network was highly centralized in both years and that roost and
	social networks differed significantly from random networks. Roost and
	social network structure also differed substantially between years.
	Social network structure appeared to be unrelated to segregation of
	roosts between age classes. For bats whose individual foraging ranges
	were calculated, many shared foraging space with at least one other bat.
	Compared across all possible bat dyads, 47\% and 43\% of the dyads
	showed more than expected overlap of foraging areas in 2009 and 2010
	respectively. Colony roosting area differed between years, but the

	foraging area use was similar between years. Random roost removal
	simulations suggest that Indiana bat colonies may be robust to loss of a
	limited number of roosts but may respond differently from year to year.
	Our study emphasizes the utility of graphic theoretic and spatial

	Abstract = {Quantifying the nodal spreading abilities and identifying the potential
	influential spreaders has been one of the most engaging topics recently,
	which is essential and beneficial to facilitate information flow and
	ensure the stabilization operations of social networks. However, most of
	the existing algorithms just consider a fundamental quantification
	through combining a certain attribute of the nodes to measure the nodes'
	importance. Moreover, reaching a balance between the accuracy and the
	simplicity of these algorithms is difficult. In order to accurately
	identify the potential super-spreaders, the CumulativeRank algorithm is
	proposed in the present study. This algorithm combines the local and
	global performances of nodes for measuring the nodal spreading
	abilities. In local performances, the proposed algorithm considers both
	the direct influence from the node's neighbourhoods and the indirect
	influence from the nearest and the next nearest neighbours. On the other
	hand, in the global performances, the concept of the tenacity is
	introduced to assess the node's prominent position in maintaining the
	network connectivity. Extensive experiments carried out with the
	Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model on real-world social networks
	demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the proposed algorithm.
	Furthermore, the comparison of the proposed algorithm with the existing
	well-known algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm has lower time
	complexity and can be applicable to large-scale networks.},

	Abstract = {Introduction
	Studies of community-based obesity prevention interventions have
	hypothesized that stake-holder networks are a critical element of
	effective implementation. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of
	the interpersonal network structures within a sub-sample of
	stake-holders from two past successful childhood obesity prevention
	interventions.
	Methods
	Participants were recruited from the stakeholder groups (steering
	committees) of two completed community-based intervention studies, Romp
	\& Chomp (R\&C), Australia (2004-2008) and Shape Up Somerville (SUS),
	USA (2003-2005). Both studies demonstrated significant reductions of
	overweight and obesity among children. Members of the steering
	committees were asked to complete a retrospective social network
	questionnaire using a roster of other committee members and free recall.
	Each participant was asked to recall the people with whom they discussed
	issues related to childhood obesity throughout the intervention period,
	along with providing the closeness and level of influence of each
	relationship.
	Results
	Networks were reported by 13 participants from the SUS steering
	committee and 8 participants from the R\&C steering committee. On
	average, participants nominated 16 contacts with whom they discussed
	issues related to childhood obesity through the intervention, with
	approximately half of the relationships described as `close' and 30\% as
	`influential'. The `discussion' and `close' networks had high clustering
	and reciprocity, with ties directed to other steering committee members,
	and to individuals external to the committee. In contrast, influential
	ties were more prominently directed internal to the steering committee,
	with higher network centralization, lower reciprocity and lower
	clustering.
	Discussion and conclusion
	Social network analysis provides a method to evaluate the ties within
	steering committees of community-based obesity prevention interventions.
	In this study, the network characteristics between a sub-set of
	stakeholders appeared to be supportive of diffused communication. Future
	work should prospectively examine stakeholder network structures in a
	heterogeneous sample of community-based interventions to identify
	elements most strongly associated with intervention effectiveness.},

	find that moderately-sized network effects (e.g., rho=.3) are still

	Analyses reveal that statistical power is primarily a nonlinear function
	of network effect size (rho) and network size (N), although both of

	Abstract = {Confusions between substantive and relational concepts of kinship as a
	social network have led to a number of problems that are clarified by a
	temporally ordered relational theory of network structure. The
	ordered-network approach gives rise to a novel means of graphing the
	social field of kinship relations, while allowing kinship to be locally
	defined in culturally relative terms. Its utility is exemplified in
	applications to kinships among US Presidents, Old Testament Canaanites,
	and native Australians of Groote Eylandt. The formal concepts treated in
	the mapping of kinship networks are: kinship axioms, parental graph
	structure, core, circuits of consanguineally and affinally linked kin,
	sides and divides, homeomorphic mappings, homomorphisms as potentially
	simplifying mappings of kinship, elementary structure, and
	order-structure. Representational theorems are proven about
	homeomorphisms, cores and circuits, and the ambiguity of elementary
	structures. The last set of theorems leads to clarifying and redefining
	some of the basic concepts of elementary, semi-complex and complex
	structures of kinship in terms of properties of generationally ordered
	networks. The conclusions of the formal argument are `post-structural'
	in the narrow sense of demonstrating the need for specifying contingent
	historical processes in the structural analysis of kinship as a social
	field. The open-ended approach to change, one that is implied by the
	study of ordered structures that unfold in a temporal succession,
	connects to issues of population variability, selection, and
	evolutionary processes. The kinship structures that are mapped in this
	approach are not intended as any sort of complete representations of
	kinship `systems', but merely as scaffoldings that help to bring into
	view kinship as a social field, providing a baseline for other mappings
	(which may be superimposed) of social processes such as communicative
	fields, exchange processes, transmission of learned behaviors, social
	rights and inheritance, political and religious succession, and the

	predominantly with one another. However, our knowledge of the role of
	cooperative phenotypes in the social structuring of real-world animal

	We then examined the social network structure of one of these

	on social network theory to examine the relationship between observable

	cohesion. Leveraging Facebook data, we extracted and partitioned the

	density and size using social network analysis. Out of six linear mixed
	effects models specified, a random intercept and fixed slope model with

	fitting. Whereas group density was not linked to perceived cohesion,
	size had a small negative effect on perceived cohesion, suggesting that

	in mediating the recruitment and retention of members in organizations.
	But organizations also comprise a primary context where people form
	social ties. We investigate how the network structure an organization
	creates among its members influences its ability to grow and reproduce.
	In particular, we propose that two dimensions of organizational strategy
	influence affiliation dynamics: (1) the extent to which an organization
	induces social interaction among its members (social encapsulation), and
	(2) the time and energy that an organization demands of its members
	(time and energy demand). We examine membership dynamics in an ecology
	where competitor organizations deploying varied strategies vie for the
	same pool of members. Results show a curvilinear relationship between
	membership growth and the rate of social encapsulation. Furthermore, we
	find that time and energy demand mediates the effect of social
	encapsulation by shaping its members' opportunities for maintaining
	external affiliations. Different opportunity structures result in
	different levels of network turnover, thus either reinforcing or
	dissolving intra-organizational ties. For most types of organizations,
	attaining sustained growth requires a balance between open networks (for
	recruitment) and network closure (for retention).},

	opinion formation, less attention has been paid to explain how the
	structure of social networks and their contextual circumstances can
	influence the course of minority public opinions. This work aims to pose
	three basic questions: (1) how the structure of social networks can

	influence this process, and (3) how mass media action, as a contextual
	factor, can vary different agents' opinions and network composition.
	Agent-based modeling is used to create a network model of preferential
	attachment to explore how phenomena of minority opinion spreading can
	evolve under different simulated scenarios. This study shows that the
	success of minority opinions depends on network structure and
	composition and thus on external factors such as mass media action that
	can mediate the strength of these internal determinants. Although people
	tend to remain silent when they feel that their opinions are in the
	minority, our findings suggest that prevailing majority opinion may be
	promptly replaced by what was formerly minority opinion if core agents
	in the network structure and/or external sources support this view.},

	Abstract = {The appearance of large geolocated communication datasets has recently
	increased our understanding of how social networks relate to their

	the spatial clustering of network communities, have not yet been
	systematically tested at different scales. In this work we analyze the
	social network structure of over 25 million phone users from three
	countries at three different scales: country, provinces and cities. We
	consistently find that this last urban scenario presents significant
	differences to common knowledge about social networks. First, the
	emergence of a giant component in the network seems to be controlled by
	whether or not the network spans over the entire urban border, almost
	independently of the population or geographic extension of the city.
	Second, urban communities are much less geographically clustered than
	expected. These two findings shed new light on the widely-studied
	searchability in self-organized networks. By exhaustive simulation of
	decentralized search strategies we conclude that urban networks are
	searchable not through geographical proximity as their country-wide
	counterparts, but through an homophily-driven community structure.},

	nodes (hashtags) that function as junctions and the distinct hashtag
	communities were identified and represented visually as graphs. The

	linking these clusters were investigated and interpreted.},

	We then develop a complete taxonomy of all 138 possible triads of
	two-type relationships. Consistent with balance theory, we find that
	antagonists of friends and friends of antagonists tend to be
	antagonists; but, in an important empirical refutation of balance
	theory, we find that antagonists of antagonists also tend to be
	antagonists, not friends. Finally, villages with comparable levels of
	animosity tend to be geographically proximate. Similar processes,
	involving social contact, give rise to both positive and negative social
	ties in rural villages, and negative ties play an important role in
	social structure.},

	Abstract = {Individual level response to natural and anthropogenic disturbance
	represents an increasingly important, but as yet little understood,
	component of animal behavior. Disturbance events often alter habitat,
	which in turn can modify behaviors of individuals in affected areas,
	including changes in habitat use and associated changes in social
	structure. To better understand these relationships, we investigated
	aspects of habitat selection and social connectivity of a small
	passerine bird, the red-backed fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus),
	before vs. after naturally occurring fire disturbance in Northern
	Territory, Australia. We utilized a social network framework to evaluate
	changes in social dynamics pre-vs. post-fire. Our study covered the
	non-breeding season in two consecutive years in which fires occurred,
	and individuals whose habitat was affected and those that were not
	affected by fire. Individuals in habitat affected by fires had stronger
	social ties (i.e. higher weighted degree) after fires, while those that
	were in areas that were not affected by fire actually had lower weighted
	degree. We suggest that this change in social connections may be linked
	to habitat. Before fires, fairywrens used habitat that had similar grass
	cover to available habitat plots randomly generated within our study
	site. Fire caused a reduction in grass cover, and fairywrens responded
	by selecting habitat with higher grass cover relative to random plots.
	This study demonstrates how changes in habitat and/or resource
	availability caused by disturbance can lead to substantive changes in
	the social environment that individuals experience.},

	Abstract = {The paper investigates the integration of immigrant children and their

	multiplexity in social network terminology. These dimensions are
	children's friendships, their attendance at birthday parties, and
	contact among their parents. By attending birthday parties, children's
	friendships are publicly reinforced and membership in a social circle is
	signified. During these events, communication and social exchange drive
	the process of social integration at the micro-level, and ethnic
	boundaries can be shifted or blurred. It will be shown that a variety of
	homophily effects can be found in all three network dimensions. In
	addition, ethnic segregation in parents' networks has an impact on
	children's participation in these events and, thereby, on children's
	integration in social networks. However, the causal effect in the other
	way around - children's birthday party attendance on contact among their
	parents - is even stronger. A new approach is the non-recursive analysis
	of how ties in one network dimension effect ties in another dimension.

	Abstract = {Objectives: Previous criminological scholarship has posited that network
	ties among neighborhood residents may impact crime rates, but has done
	little to consider the specific ways in which network structure may
	enhance or inhibit criminal activity. A lack of data on social ties has
	arguably led to this state of affairs. We propose to avoid this
	limitation by demonstrating a novel approach of extrapolatively
	simulating network ties and constructing structural network measures to
	assess their effect on neighborhood crime rates.
	Methods: We first spatially locate the households of a city into their
	constituent blocks. Then, we employ spatial interaction functions based
	on prior empirical work and simulate a network of social ties among
	these residents. From this simulated network, we compute network
	statistics that more appropriately capture the notions of cohesion and
	information diffusion that underlie theories of networks and crime.
	Results: We show that these network statistics are robust predictors of
	the levels of crime in five separate cities (above standard controls) at
	the very micro geographic level of blocks and block groups.
	Conclusions: We conclude by considering extensions of the approach that
	account for homophily in the formation of network ties. (C) 2013

	Abstract = {An outstanding open problem is whether collective social phenomena
	occurring over short timescales can systematically reduce cultural
	heterogeneity in the long run, and whether offline and online human
	interactions contribute differently to the process. Theoretical models
	suggest that short-term collective behavior and long-term cultural
	diversity are mutually excluding, since they require very different
	levels of social influence. The latter jointly depends on two factors:
	the topology of the underlying social network and the overlap between
	individuals in multidimensional cultural space. However, while the
	empirical properties of social networks are intensively studied, little
	is known about the large-scale organization of real societies in
	cultural space, so that random input specifications are necessarily used
	in models. Here we use a large dataset to perform a high-dimensional
	analysis of the scientific beliefs of thousands of Europeans. We find
	that interopinion correlations determine a nontrivial ultrametric
	hierarchy of individuals in cultural space. When empirical data are used
	as inputs in models, ultrametricity has strong and counterintuitive
	effects. On short timescales, it facilitates a symmetry-breaking phase
	transition triggering coordinated social behavior. On long timescales,
	it suppresses cultural convergence by restricting it within disjoint
	groups. Moreover, ultrametricity implies that these results are
	surprisingly robust to modifications of the dynamical rules considered.
	Thus the empirical distribution of individuals in cultural space appears
	to systematically optimize the coexistence of short-term collective
	behavior and long-term cultural diversity, which can be realized
	simultaneously for the same moderate level of mutual influence in a
	diverse range of online and offline settings.},

	geographical extensions of social influence modelling. Improved
	understanding of innovation diffusion across locations and through
	social connections can provide us with new insights into the spread of
	information, technological progress and economic development. In this
	work, we analyze the spatial adoption dynamics of iWiW, an Online Social
	Network (OSN) in Hungary and uncover empirical features about the
	spatial adoption in social networks. During its entire life cycle from
	2002 to 2012, iWiW reached up to 300 million friendship ties of 3
	million users. We find that the number of adopters as a function of town
	population follows a scaling law that reveals a strongly concentrated
	early adoption in large towns and a less concentrated late adoption. We
	also discover a strengthening distance decay of spread over the
	life-cycle indicating high fraction of distant diffusion in early stages
	but the dominance of local diffusion in late stages. The spreading
	process is modelled within the Bass diffusion framework that enables us
	to compare the differential equation version with an agent-based version
	of the model run on the empirical network. Although both model versions
	can capture the macro trend of adoption, they have limited capacity to
	describe the observed trends of urban scaling and distance decay. We
	find, however that incorporating adoption thresholds, defined by the
	fraction of social connections that adopt a technology before the
	individual adopts, improves the network model fit to the urban scaling
	of early adopters. Controlling for the threshold distribution enables us
	to eliminate the bias induced by local network structure on predicting
	local adoption peaks. Finally, we show that geographical features such
	as distance from the innovation origin and town size influence

	Abstract = {Interactions within complex network components define their operational
	modes, collective behaviors and global functionality. Understanding the
	role of these interactions is limited by either sensing methodologies or
	intentional adversarial efforts that sabotage the network structure. To
	overcome the partial observability and infer with good fidelity the
	unobserved network structures (latent subnetworks that are not random
	samples of the full network), we propose a general causal inference
	framework for reconstructing network structures under unknown
	adversarial interventions. We explore its applicability in both
	biological and social systems to recover the latent structures of human
	protein complex interactions and brain connectomes, as well as to infer
	the camouflaged social network structure in a simulated removal process.
	The demonstrated effectiveness establishes its good potential for
	capturing hidden information in much broader research domains.},

	Abstract = {In recent years there has been much interest in investigating the social
	structure of group living animals using social network analysis. Many
	studies so far have focused on the social networks of adults, often
	excluding younger, immature group members. This potentially may lead to
	a biased view of group social structure as multiple recent studies have
	shown that younger group members can significantly contribute to group
	structure. As proof of the concept, we address this issue by
	investigating social network structure with and without juveniles in
	wild olive baboons (Papio anubis) at Gashaka Gumti National Park,
	Nigeria. Two social networks including all independently moving
	individuals (i.e., excluding dependent juveniles) were created based on
	aggressive and grooming behaviour. We used knockout simulations based on
	the random removal of individuals from the network in order to
	investigate to what extent the exclusion of juveniles affects the
	resulting network structure and our interpretation of age-sex specific
	social roles. We found that juvenile social patterns differed from those
	of adults and that the exclusion of juveniles from the network
	significantly altered the resulting overall network structure. Moreover,
	the removal of juveniles from the network affected individuals in
	specific age-sex classes differently: for example, including juveniles
	in the grooming network increased network centrality of adult females
	while decreasing centrality of adult males. These results suggest that
	excluding juveniles from the analysis may not only result in a distorted
	picture of the overall social structure but also may mask some of the
	social roles of individuals belonging to different age-sex classes.},

	to different results in cultivating bridging and bonding social capital
	for different groups of people. Based on in-depth interviews of 45
	university students in Hong Kong, I find that Mainland Chinese students
	studying in Hong Kong actively use SNSs for seeking practical
	information about offline matters, and they obtain substantial enacted
	support from other Mainland students of the same university through SNS
	use. As a result, they accumulate both bridging and bonding social
	capital. Local Hong Kong students, however, use SNSs mainly for social
	information seeking and are only able to accrue limited bridging social
	capital through SNS use. Drawing on the theory of network domains, I
	argue that the different offline network structures in which students
	are located - namely, homogeneous and closed networks versus
	heterogeneous and open networks - explain this difference. Students with
	closed offline networks have defined expectations of online ties; they
	think of their online activities as practical and leading to real
	changes in their status among peers. Those with open networks have
	indefinite expectations of their online audience; thus, they interpret
	online activities differently, thinking of them as recreational, and
	they are playful in their online behaviour. These different outcomes of
	online activities consequently lead to diverse results in social capital

	studying the behavior of these Bernoulli graph bounds, we can thus
	constrain the properties of a given random graph. We illustrate the
	utility of this approach via application to several problems from the
	social network literature, including identifying degeneracy in Markov
	graph models, studying the potential impact of tie formation mechanisms
	on epidemic potential in sexual contact networks, and robustness testing
	of inhomogeneous Bernoulli models based on geographical covariates.
	Practical heuristics for assessing bound tightness and guidance for use

	to keep access to a major part of the network. By analyzing a model and
	tennis players' partnership networks, we show that combination of vertex
	fitness and homophily yields a VIP-club made of elite vertices that are
	influential but not easily accessed from the majority. Intentionally
	formed VIP members can even serve as masterminds, which manipulate hubs
	to control the entire network without exposing themselves to a large
	mass. If based on network topology only, elites are not distinguished
	from many other vertices. Understanding network data is far from
	sufficient; individualistic factors greatly affect network structure and
	functions per se. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	paper presents an improved formulation of the extant
	information-theoretic models of deceptions, a framework for
	incorporating these models of deception into game and decision theoretic
	models of deception, and applies these models and this framework in an
	agent based evolutionary simulation that models two very common
	deception types employed in ``fake news{''} attacks. The simulation
	results for both deception types modelled show, as observed empirically
	in many social systems subjected to ``fake news{''} attacks, that even a
	very small population of deceivers that transiently invades a much
	larger population of non-deceiving agents can strongly alter the
	equilibrium behaviour of the population in favour of agents playing an
	always defect strategy. The results also show that the ability of a
	population of deceivers to establish itself or remain present in a
	population is highly sensitive to the cost of the deception, as this
	cost reduces the fitness of deceiving agents when competing against
	non-deceiving agents. Diffusion behaviours observed for agents
	exploiting the deception producing false beliefs are very close to
	empirically observed behaviours in social media, when fitted to
	epidemiological models. We thus demonstrate, using the improved

	based evolutionary simulations employing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
	can accurately capture the behaviours of a population subject to
	deception attacks introducing uncertainty and false perceptions, and

	Abstract = {Introduction
	Use of online social networks for smoking cessation has been associated
	with abstinence. Little is known about the mechanisms through which the
	formation of social ties in an online network may influence smoking
	behavior. Using dynamic social network analysis, we investigated how
	temporal changes of an individual's number of social network ties are
	prospectively related to abstinence in an online social network for
	cessation. In a network where quitting is normative and is the focus of
	communications among members, we predicted that an increasing number of
	ties would be positively associated with abstinence.
	Method
	Participants were N = 2,657 adult smokers recruited to a randomized
	cessation treatment trial following enrollment on BecomeAnEX. org, a
	longstanding Internet cessation program with a large and mature online
	social network. At 3-months post-randomization, 30-day point prevalence
	abstinence was assessed and website engagement metrics were extracted.
	The social network was constructed with clickstream data to capture the
	flow of information among members. Two network centrality metrics were
	calculated at weekly intervals over 3 months: 1) indegree, defined as
	the number of members whose posts a participant read; and 2)
	out-degreeaware, defined as the number of members who read a
	participant's post and commented, which was subsequently viewed by the
	participant. Three groups of users were identified based on social
	network engagement patterns: non-users (N = 1,362), passive users (N =
	812), and active users (N = 483). Logistic regression modeled 3-month
	abstinence by group as a function of baseline variables, website
	utilization, and network centrality metrics.
	Results
	Abstinence rates varied by group (non-users = 7.7\%, passive users =
	10.7\%, active users = 20.7\%). Significant baseline predictors of
	abstinence were age, nicotine dependence, confidence to quit, and
	smoking temptations in social situations among passive users (ps < .05);
	age and confidence to quit among active users. Among centrality metrics,
	positive associations with abstinence were observed for in-degree
	increases from Week 2 to Week 12 among passive and active users, and for
	out-degree-aware increases from Week 2 to Week 12 among active users (ps
	< .05).
	Conclusions
	This study is the first to demonstrate that increased tie formation
	among members of an online social network for smoking cessation is
	prospectively associated with abstinence. It also highlights the value
	of using individuals' activities in online social networks to predict
	their offline health behaviors.},

	analyses to understand whether social norms of drug use behaviors are

	event-based approach was used to delineate boundaries of the two

	included centrality (i.e., popularity) and cohesiveness (location in

	Results revealed that both descriptive and injunctive norms influenced
	methamphetamine use. Network cohesion was found to be associated with
	perception of both descriptive and injunctive norms in both networks,

	Month = {MAY 12},
	Abstract = {In many social complex systems, in which agents are linked by non-linear
	interactions, the history of events strongly influences the whole
	network dynamics. However, a class of ``commonly accepted beliefs{''}
	seems rarely studied. In this paper, we examine how the growth process
	of a (social) network is influenced by past circumstances. In order to
	tackle this cause, we simply modify the well known preferential
	attachment mechanism by imposing a time dependent kernel function in the
	network evolution equation. This approach leads to a fractional order
	Barabosi-Albert (BA) differential equation, generalizing the BA model.
	Our results show that, with passing time, an aging process is observed
	for the network dynamics. The aging process leads to a decay for the
	node degree values, thereby creating an opposing process to the
	preferential attachment mechanism. On one hand, based on the
	preferential attachment mechanism, nodes with a high degree are more
	likely to absorb links; but, on the other hand, a node's age has a
	reduced chance for new connections. This competitive scenario allows an
	increased chance for younger members to become a hub. Simulations of

	Abstract = {In online social media networks, individuals often have hundreds or even
	thousands of connections, which link these users not only to friends,
	associates, and colleagues, but also to news outlets, celebrities, and
	organizations. In these complex social networks, a `community' as
	studied in the social network literature, can have very different
	meaning depending on the property of the network under study. Taking
	into account the multifaceted nature of these networks, we claim that
	community detection in online social networks should also be
	multifaceted in order to capture all of the different and valuable
	viewpoints of `community.' In this paper we focus on three types of
	communities beyond follower-based structural communities:
	activity-based, topic-based, and interaction-based. We analyze a Twitter
	dataset using three different weightings of the structural network meant
	to highlight these three community types, and then infer the communities
	associated with these weightings. We show that interesting insights can
	be obtained about the complex community structure present in social
	networks by studying when and how these four community types give rise
	to similar as well as completely distinct community structure.},

	Abstract = {One way to think about social context is as a sample of alters. To
	understand individual action, therefore, it matters greatly where these
	alters may be coming from, and how they are connected. According to one
	vision, connections among alters induce local dependencies-emergent
	rules of social interaction that generate endogenously the observed
	network structure of social settings. Social selection is the decision
	of interest in this perspective. According to a second vision, social
	settings are collections of social foci-physical or symbolic locales
	where actors meet. Because alters are more likely to be drawn from
	focused sets, shared social foci are frequently considered as the main
	generators of network ties, and hence of setting structure. Affiliation
	to social foci is the decision of central interest in this second view.
	In this paper we show how stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs)
	originally derived for studying the dynamics of multiple networks may be
	adopted to represent and examine these interconnected systems of
	decisions (selection and affiliation) within a unified analytical
	framework. We illustrate the empirical value of the model in the context
	of a longitudinal sample of adolescent participating in the Glasgow
	Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study. Social selection decisions are
	examined in the context of networks of friendship relations. The
	analysis treats musical genres as the main social foci of interest.},

	developed to serve as the experimental ground for this analysis.
	Diffusion dynamics of a nonsticky innovation is investigated by varying
	homophily levels in the social network depicted in the model as the
	primary control variable. First of all, the results show that homophily
	is self-reinforcing. Second, starting from a nonhomophilous network,
	early increases in the level of homophily have a positive effect on the
	extent of diffusion, whereas further increases have a negative impact.
	Finally, several local minima and maxima are observed in the relation
	between the homophily level and the extent of diffusion. Our analysis
	focuses on node properties such as connectedness and average degrees in
	order to explain the observed regular relationship between homophily and
	diffusion. We argue that (i) homophily increases the connectedness of
	different status groups separately and (ii) increasing levels of
	homophily decreases the marginal importance of a single homophilous tie
	by increasing the sources of valuable information. Future research
	involves investigating the coevolution of social behavior and networks
	by allowing the adopted innovation to lead to value homophily,
	exploration of different diffusion initiation types, and different
	adoption heuristics.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies the problem of public opinion formation and
	concentrates on the interplays among three factors: individual
	attributes, environmental influences and information flow. We present a
	simple model to analyze the dynamics of four types of networks. Our
	simulations suggest that regular communities establish not only local
	consensus, but also global diversity in public opinions. However, when
	small world networks, random networks, or scale-free networks model
	social relationships, the results are sensitive to the elasticity
	coefficient of environmental influences and the average connectivity of
	the type of network. For example, a community with a higher average
	connectivity has a higher probability of consensus. Yet, it is
	misleading to predict results merely based on the characteristic path
	length of networks. In the process of changing environmental influences
	and average connectivity, sensitive areas are discovered in the system.
	By sensitive areas we mean that interior randomness emerges and we
	cannot predict unequivocally how many opinions will remain upon reaching
	equilibrium. We also investigate the role of authoritative individuals
	in information control. While enhancing average connectivity facilitates
	the diffusion of the authoritative opinion, it makes individuals subject
	to disturbance from non-authorities as well. Thus, a moderate average
	connectivity may be preferable because then the public will most likely
	form an opinion that is parallel with the authoritative one. In a
	community with a scale-free structure, the influence of authoritative
	individuals keeps constant with the change of the average connectivity.
	Provided that the influence of individuals is proportional to the number
	of their acquaintances, the smallest percentage of authorities is
	required for a controlled consensus in a scale free network. This study
	shows that the dynamics of public opinion varies from community to
	community due to the different degree of impressionability of people and
	the distinct social network structure of the community.},

	be the result of the number of sociometric trust choices he or she

	actors he/she trusts (contagion effect). Second, selection mechanisms
	postulate that a focal actor will be more likely to develop
	interpersonal trust in colleagues with a high job satisfaction
	(attractiveness effect) or with similar levels of job satisfaction as
	the focal actor (homophily effect). Third, according to intrapersonal
	spillover mechanisms, a high level of job satisfaction can either
	facilitate the creation of interpersonal trust relationships
	(satisfaction spillover effect), or individuals initiating a high number
	of interpersonal trust relationships can exhibit higher levels of
	satisfaction (trust spillover effect). To simultaneously test these six
	hypotheses, longitudinal intra-organizational social network data from a
	Dutch housing company (n = 57) were used. We found a significant

	selection effect. Moreover, contrary to what we expected, employees with

	However, the sheer size and complexity of the social world makes it
	impossible to acquire firsthand knowledge of all relations within a
	network, suggesting that people must make inferences about unobserved
	relationships to fill in the gaps. Across three studies (n = 328), we
	show that people can encode information about social features (e.g.,
	hobbies, clubs) and subsequently deploy this knowledge to infer the
	existence of unobserved friendships in the network. Using computational
	models, we test various feature-based mechanisms that could support such
	inferences. We find that people's ability to successfully generalize
	depends on two representational strategies: a simple but inflexible
	similarity heuristic that leverages homophily, and a complex but
	flexible cognitive map that encodes the statistical relationships
	between social features and friendships. Together, our studies reveal
	that people can build cognitive maps encoding arbitrary patterns of
	latent relations in many abstract feature spaces, allowing social
	networks to be represented in a flexible format. Moreover, these
	findings shed light on open questions across disciplines about how
	people learn and represent social networks and may have implications for

	faster than ties to similar persons - and we test three explanations for
	this faster decay of ties with dissimilar others: lack of meeting
	opportunities, preferences for similarity, and lower network
	embeddedness. To test these explanations, we analysed two waves of the
	Survey on the Social Networks of the Dutch (SSND, 2007, 2014). These
	SSND-waves contain comprehensive longitudinal panel data on ego networks
	of 441 respondents, who were interviewed about a wide range of
	relationships, their alters' sociodemographic characteristics, where and
	when they met their alters, as well as how and whether they maintain
	these relationships. We modelled tie loss by event history analyses.
	Results show that ties to persons who were dissimilar are more likely to
	be lost faster, and that tie loss occurs mostly in the early years of a
	relationship. However, meeting opportunities, preferences for
	similarity, and network embeddedness are unable to explain why ties to
	dissimilar others are lost faster. We conclude that dissimilarity is a
	powerful driver of tie loss, and that more arguments and research are
	needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are widely used for modeling
	social networks observed at one point in time. However the computational
	difficulty of ERGM parameter estimation has limited the practical
	application of this class of models to relatively small networks, up to
	a few thousand nodes at most, with usually only a few hundred nodes or
	fewer. In the case of undirected networks, snowball sampling can be used
	to find ERGM parameter estimates of larger networks via network samples,
	and recently published improvements in ERGM network distribution
	sampling and ERGM estimation algorithms have allowed ERGM parameter
	estimates of undirected networks with over one hundred thousand nodes to
	be made. However the implementations of these algorithms to date have
	been limited in their scalability, and also restricted to undirected
	networks. Here we describe an implementation of the recently published
	Equilibrium Expectation (EE) algorithm for ERGM parameter estimation of
	large directed networks. We test it on some simulated networks, and
	demonstrate its application to an online social network with over 1.6

	Abstract = {Human-wildlife encounters are becoming increasingly frequent across the
	globe, often leading people to interact with and feed wild animals and
	impacting animal behaviour and ecology. Although the nature of
	human-wildlife interactions has been well documented across a number of
	species, we still have limited understanding as to why some individual
	animals interact more frequently with humans than others. Additionally,
	we lack a comprehensive understanding of how these interactions
	influence animal social networks. Using behavioural data from a group of
	moor macaque monkeys (Macaca maura), we used permutation-based linear
	regression analyses to understand how life history and social network
	factors jointly explain interindividual variation in tendency to
	interact with humans along a provincial road in South Sulawesi,
	Indonesia. As our study group spent only a portion of their time in
	proximity to humans, we also examined how social network structure
	changes in response to human presence by comparing social networks in
	the forest to those along the road. We found that sex, individual
	network position, and associate network position interact in complex
	ways to influence individual behaviour. Individual variation in tendency
	to be along the road caused social networks to become less cohesive when
	in proximity to humans. This study demonstrates that nuanced intragroup
	analyses are necessary to fully understand and address conservation
	issues relating to human-wildlife interactions.},

	Abstract = {Inter-personal affiliations and coalitions are an important part of
	politicians' behaviour, but are often difficult to observe. Since an
	increasing amount of political communication now occurs online, data
	from online interactions may offer a new toolkit to study ties between
	politicians; however, the methods by which robust insights can be
	derived from online data require further development, especially around
	the dynamics of political social networks. We develop a novel method for
	tracking the evolution of community structures, referred to as
	`multiplex community affiliation clustering' (MCAC), and use it to study
	the online social networks of Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of
	the European Parliament (MEPs) in the United Kingdom. Social interaction
	networks are derived from social media (Twitter) communication over an
	eventful 17-month period spanning the UK General Election in 2015 and
	the UK Referendum on membership of the European Union in 2016. We find
	that the social network structure linking MPs and MEPs evolves over
	time, with distinct communities forming and re-forming, driven by party
	affiliations and political events. Without including any information
	about time in our model, we nevertheless find that the evolving social
	network structure shows multiple persistent and recurring states of
	affiliation between politicians, which align with content states derived
	from topic analysis of tweet text. These findings show that the dominant
	state of partisan segregation can be challenged by major political
	events, ideology, and intra-party tension that transcend party
	affiliations. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	In contrast, once the initial hurdle of getting involved has been taken,

	focused on its problematic assumptions and the biases and inefficiencies

	given only slight attention to the topic of estimating sampling variance
	in RDS, despite the importance of variance estimation for the

	critical assumption that the network is First Order Markov (FOM) with
	respect to the dependent variable of interest. We demonstrate, through
	intuitive examples, mathematical generalizations, and computational
	experiments that current RDS variance estimators will always
	underestimate the population sampling variance of RDS in empirical
	networks that do not conform to the FOM assumption. Analysis of 215
	observed university and school networks from Facebook and Add Health
	indicates that the FOM assumption is violated in every empirical network
	we analyze, and that these violations lead to substantially biased RDS
	estimators of sampling variance. We propose and test two alternative
	variance estimators that show some promise for reducing biases, but
	which also illustrate the limits of estimating sampling variance with

	Abstract = {The literature reveals that delinquency is a group phenomenon. However,
	there is controversy regarding the explanation of this finding.
	Subcultural theorists argue that youths become delinquent through peer
	socialization in youth gangs. Control theorists, by contrast, argue that
	adolescents become delinquent and associate with delinquent others
	because they have weakened bonds to the conventional order. Our paper
	examines the role of social bonds and group structure in the generation
	of delinquency through the application of social network analysis. Our
	findings support the control explanation; those members who have the
	weakest bonds, regardless of gang participation, are the most delinquent
	(as measured by delinquent attitudes). While our results indicate that
	companionship (by itself) does not lead youths to become delinquent, we
	argue that it is still important in the explanation of delinquency.},

	to quality information was crucial. This research aimed to analyze the
	science and health-related hoaxes that were spread during the pandemic
	with the objectives of (1) identifying the characteristics of the form
	and content of such false information, and the platforms used to spread
	them, and (2) formulating a typology that can be used to classify the
	different types of hoaxes according to their connection with scientific
	information. The study was conducted by analyzing the content of hoaxes
	which were debunked by the three main fact-checking organizations in
	Spain in the three months following WHO's announcement of the pandemic
	(N = 533). The results indicated that science and health content played
	a prominent role in shaping the spread of these hoaxes during the
	pandemic. The most common hoaxes on science and health involved
	information on scientific research or health management, used text, were
	based on deception, used real sources, were international in scope, and
	were spread through social networks. Based on the analysis, we proposed
	a system for classifying science and health-related hoaxes, and
	identified four types according to their connection to scientific
	knowledge: ``hasty{''} science, decontextualized science, badly
	interpreted science, and falsehood without a scientific basis. The
	rampant propagation and widespread availability of disinformation point
	to the need to foster media and scientific caution and literacy among
	the public and increase awareness of the importance of timing and
	substantiation of scientific research. The results can be useful in
	improving media literacy to face disinformation, and the typology we
	formulate can help develop future systems for automated detection of

	good efficiency by considering the network structure and using as a
	fundamental criterion the number of common neighbours between two nodes
	to establish structural similarity. High structural similarity may
	suggest that a link between two nodes is likely to appear. However, as
	shown in the paper, the number of common neighbours may not be always
	sufficient to provide comprehensive information about structural
	similarity between a pair of nodes. To address this, a neighbourhood
	vector is first specified for each node. Then, a novel measure is

	In computational social science, epidemic-inspired spread models have

	disseminator's followers and receiver's followees. To develop a more
	realistic model of information diffusion, we incorporate this finding
	together with a heterogeneous response time into a cascade model. After

	cohesion, enabled by social media usage, could play a significant role

	Our results show that, unlike regular social cohesion, communication
	history and physical proximity do not significantly affect emergent
	social cohesion. The results also indicate that weak social ties play an
	important role in bridging different social network communities, and

	Abstract = {Collective navigation demands that group members reach consensus on
	which path to follow, a task that might become more challenging when the
	group's members have different social connections. Group decision-making
	mechanisms have been studied successfully in the past using
	individual-based modelling, although many of these studies have
	neglected the role of social connections between the group's interacting
	members. Nevertheless, empirical studies have demonstrated that
	individual recognition, previous shared experiences and inter-individual
	familiarity can influence the cohesion and the dynamics of the group as
	well as the relative spatial positions of specific individuals within
	it. Here, we use models of collective motion to study the impact of
	social relationships on group navigation by introducing social network
	structures into a model of collective motion. Our results show that
	groups consisting of equally informed individuals achieve the highest
	level of accuracy when they are hierarchically organized with the
	minimum number of preferred connections per individual. We also observe
	that the navigational accuracy of a group will depend strongly on
	detailed aspects of its social organization. More specifically, group
	navigation does not only depend on the underlying social relationships,

	Also, we show that groups with certain social structures can compensate
	better for an increased level of navigational error. The results have
	broader implications for studies on collective navigation and motion
	because they show that only by considering a group's social system can
	we fully elucidate the dynamics and advantages of joint movements.},

	Abstract = {Many structural definitions for social community have been proposed in
	attempt to characterize and further understand the structure of social
	relationships. Algorithms using quantitative concepts such as centrality
	measures, spectral methods and other clustering measures have been used
	to compute social communities. While these methods have had much success
	in extracting meaningful subgroups in social and biological (and other)
	networks, they do not necessarily reveal the defining structure of
	social attraction.
	We propose a new definition here for social community with a very clear
	and simple graph-theoretic structure which can also be realized as a new
	clique-relaxation. This structure evolved from Freeman's definition of
	social community, and this definition is further supported by
	long-standing sociometric principles such as Granovetter's weak-tie
	hypothesis or Faust's and others' studies on how global structure can be
	inferred from a complete understanding of local structures (although our
	definition goes beyond dyadic and triadic configurations). We provide
	computational results that show our simply-stated structural definition
	reveals communities that correspond almost identically to, and sometimes
	are better than, the widely used centrality-based methods.
	We name these new communities familial groups, inspired by the network
	structures resulting from inheritance or blood-line relations. These
	structures form naturally in hierarchical arrangements such as in
	corporate settings. Using results from graph theory, our structural
	definition for familial groups also immediately implies a ranking of the
	individuals within the group, easily identifying leaders and
	subcommunities. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	different values. Here the tendency for the tie formation between two
	individuals due to the overlap in their features represents homophily.
	We find a phase transition as a function of F or q, resulting in a phase
	diagram. For fixed q and as a function of F the system shows two phases
	separated at F-c. For F < F-c large, homogeneous, and well separated
	communities can be identified within which the features match almost
	perfectly (segregated phase). When F becomes larger than Fc the nodes
	start to belong to several communities and within a community the
	features match only partially (overlapping phase). Several quantities

	Our findings render a rather complex and nuanced picture, showing three

	networked individuals, socially connected but not networked individuals,
	and socially constrained individuals. Although most participants are
	socially connected, those who are networked individuals actively manage
	and navigate multiple, diverse, and non-redundant social networks.

	Abstract = {In recent years, a large body of research has demonstrated that
	judgments and behaviors can propagate from person to person. Phenomena
	as diverse as political mobilization, health practices, altruism, and
	emotional states exhibit similar dynamics of social contagion. The
	precise mechanisms of judgment propagation are not well understood,
	however, because it is difficult to control for confounding factors such
	as homophily or dynamic network structures. We introduce an experimental
	design that renders possible the stringent study of judgment
	propagation. In this design, experimental chains of individuals can
	revise their initial judgment in a visual perception task after
	observing a predecessor's judgment. The positioning of a very good
	performer at the top of a chain created a performance gap, which
	triggered waves of judgment propagation down the chain. We evaluated the
	dynamics of judgment propagation experimentally. Despite strong social
	influence within pairs of individuals, the reach of judgment propagation
	across a chain rarely exceeded a social distance of three to four
	degrees of separation. Furthermore, computer simulations showed that the
	speed of judgment propagation decayed exponentially with the social
	distance from the source. We show that information distortion and the
	overweighting of other people's errors are two individual-level
	mechanisms hindering judgment propagation at the scale of the chain. Our
	results contribute to the understanding of social-contagion processes,
	and our experimental method offers numerous new opportunities to study
	judgment propagation in the laboratory.},

	Abstract = {We study to what degree and how homophily and network properties affect

	We built first-order personal coauthorship networks out of the Web of

	node or ego, while her coauthors are alters. We analyze the data using
	structural measurements methods, hierarchical regression models, and we
	make visualizations based on the clustered graph technique. For all
	three populations, our results indicate that the mean score of the
	citations of alters substantially predicts the citation counts of egos.
	In particular, citation similarity increases the chances for
	coauthorship ties. Evidence for the impact of network properties on the
	citation levels of egos is mixed. For Poland, normalized ego-betweenness
	shows a negative effect on citation counts, while network density
	displays a positive one. For Romania and Slovenia, network
	characteristics have only a minor impact. Even if the visual

	Abstract = {In today's technology-assisted society, social interactions may be
	expressed through a variety of techno-communication channels, including
	online social networks, email and mobile phones (calls, text messages).
	Consequently, a clear grasp of human behavior through the diverse
	communication media is considered a key factor in understanding the
	formation of the today's information society. So far, all previous
	research on user communication behavior has focused on a sole
	communication activity. In this paper we move forward another step on
	this research path by performing a multidimensional study of human
	sociality as an expression of the use of mobile phones. The paper
	focuses on user temporal communication behavior in the interplay between
	the two complementary communication media, text messages and phone
	calls, that represent the bi-dimensional scenario of analysis. Our study
	provides a theoretical framework for analyzing multidimensional bursts
	as the most general burst category, that includes one-dimensional bursts
	as the simplest case, and offers empirical evidence of their nature by
	following the combined phone call/text message communication patterns of
	approximately one million people over three-month period. This
	quantitative approach enables the design of a generative model rooted in
	the three most significant features of the multidimensional burst - the
	number of dimensions, prevalence and interleaving degree - able to
	reproduce the main media usage attitude. The other findings of the paper
	include a novel multidimensional burst detection algorithm and an
	insight analysis of the human media selection process.},

	networks in a large scale enabled by computing power. Here, for

	when expressing their attitude toward a given candidate, are more prone
	to use imperative verbal forms in hashtags, while female users tend to
	employ declarative forms. This difference can be interpreted as a sign
	of distinct approaches in relation to other network members: for

	out. A motivating example for our work is the DARPA Red Balloon
	Challenge where the level of misreporting was very high. In order to
	undertake a formal study of verification, we introduce a model where
	agents can exert costly effort to perform verification and false reports
	can be penalized. This is the first model of verification and it
	provides many directions for future research, which we point out. Our
	main theoretical result is the compensation scheme that minimizes the
	cost of retrieving the correct answer. Notably, this optimal
	compensation scheme coincides with the winning strategy of the Red
	Balloon Challenge.},

	Abstract = {National Heritage Areas (NHAs) are an alternative and increasingly
	popular form of protected area management in the United States. NHAs
	seek to integrate environmental objectives with community and economic
	objectives at regional or landscape scales. NHA designations have
	increased rapidly in the last 20 years, generating a substantial need
	for evaluative information about (a) how NHAs work; (b) outcomes
	associated with the NHA process; and (c) the costs and benefits of
	investing public moneys into the NHA approach. Qualitative evaluation
	studies recently conducted at three NHAs have identified the importance
	of understanding network structure and function in the context of
	evaluating NHA management effectiveness. This article extends these case
	studies by examining quantitative network data from each of the sites.
	The authors analyze these data using both a descriptive approach and a
	statistically more robust approach known as exponential random graph
	modeling. Study findings indicate the presence of transitive structures
	and the absence of three-cycle structures in each of these networks.
	This suggests that these networks are relatively `'open,'' which may be
	desirable, given the uncertainty of the environments in which they
	operate. These findings also suggest, at least at the sites reported
	here, that the NHA approach may be an effective way to activate and
	develop networks of intersectoral organizational partners. Finally, this
	study demonstrates the utility of using quantitative network analysis to
	better understand the effectiveness of protected area management models
	that rely on partnership networks to achieve their intended outcomes.},

	Abstract = {Online social networks (OSNs) have become a powerful tool to study
	collective human responses to extreme events such as earthquakes. Most
	previous research concentrated on a single platform and utilized users'
	behaviors on a single platform to study people's general responses. In
	this study, we explore the characteristics of people's behaviors on
	different OSNs and conduct a cross-platform analysis of public responses
	to earthquakes. Our findings support the Uses and Gratification theory
	that users on Reddit and Twitter are engaging with platforms that they
	may feel best reflect their sense of self. Using the 2019 Ridgecrest
	earthquakes as our study cases, we collected 510,579 tweets and 45,770
	Reddit posts (including 1437 submissions and 44,333 comments) to answer
	the following research questions: (1) What were the similarities and
	differences between public responses on Twitter and Reddit? (2)
	Considering the different mechanisms of Twitter and Reddit, what unique
	information of public responses can we learn from Reddit as compared
	with Twitter? By answering these research questions, we aim to bridge
	the gap of cross-platform public responses research towards natural
	hazards. Our study evinces that the users on the two different platforms
	have both different topics of interest and different sentiments towards
	the same earthquake, which indicates the necessity of investigating
	cross-platform OSNs to reveal a more comprehensive picture of people's
	general public responses towards certain disasters. Our analysis also
	finds that r/conspiracy subreddit is one of the major venues where
	people discuss the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes on Reddit and different
	misinformation/conspiracies spread on Twitter and Reddit platforms
	(e.g., ``Big one is coming{''} on Twitter and ``Nuclear test{''} on

	between subjective poverty, material deprivation, social capital, and
	psychological distress among young adults (20-29 years); and (2) whether
	social capital mediates the subjective poverty/material
	deprivation-psychological distress association. Informal social capital
	includes connections with family and friends, perceived support, and
	perceived trust, whereas formal social capital includes volunteering and
	civic and political involvement. An additional aspect was online social
	network usage. We constructed a structural equation model to explore
	paths of relationships between subjective poverty, material deprivation,
	social capital, and psychological distress. Subjective poverty and
	material deprivation were strong predictors of psychological distress.
	Informal social capital buffered the negative effect of subjective
	poverty and material deprivations on psychological distress, whereas use
	of online social networks increased it. The use of online social
	networks, however, promoted informal social capital, which, in turn, was
	a protective factor against psychological distress. Further
	investigation is needed on which patterns and platforms of online social
	networks harm and which promote young adults' psychological wellbeing.
	Informal social capital should be a prominent aspect of both preventive
	medicine practice and health promotion initiatives among young adults.
	Policy-makers are called on to support this important means of promoting
	public health. However, to substantially narrow disparities in
	psychological distress among young adults, direct action should be taken
	to reduce poverty and material deprivation.},

	Abstract = {Preserving individual control over private information is one of the
	rising concerns in our digital society. Online social networks exist in
	application ecosystems that allow them to access data from other
	services, for example gathering contact lists through mobile phone
	applications. Such data access might allow social networking sites to
	create shadow profiles with information about non-users that has been
	inferred from information shared by the users of the social network.
	This possibility motivates the shadow profile hypothesis: the data
	shared by the users of an online service predicts personal information
	of non-users of the service. We test this hypothesis for the first time
	on Twitter, constructing a dataset of users that includes profile
	biographical text, location information, and bidirectional friendship
	links. We evaluate the predictability of the location of a user by using
	only information given by friends of the user that joined Twitter before
	the user did. This way, we audit the historical prediction power of
	Twitter data for users that had not joined Twitter yet. Our results
	indicate that information shared by users in Twitter can be predictive
	of the location of individuals outside Twitter. Furthermore, we observe
	that the quality of this prediction increases with the tendency of
	Twitter users to share their mobile phone contacts and is more accurate
	for individuals with more contacts inside Twitter. We further explore
	the predictability of biographical information of non-users, finding
	evidence in line with our results for locations. These findings
	illustrate that individuals are not in full control of their online
	privacy and that sharing personal data with a social networking site is
	a decision that is collectively mediated by the decisions of others.},

	basic steps. We first introduce a network morphogenesis model to
	reconstruct network structures where homophily can be tuned with a
	parameter. We show that as homophily increases the emergence of marked
	topological community structures in the networks raises. Secondly, we
	perform an opinion dynamics process on homophily dependent networks and
	we show that, contrary to the common idea, homophily helps consensus
	formation. Finally, we introduce a tunable external media pressure and

	Abstract = {Numerous real-world systems can be modeled as networks. To date, most
	network studies have been conducted assuming stationary network
	characteristics. Many systems, however, undergo topological changes over
	time. Temporal networks, which incorporate time into conventional
	network models, are therefore more accurate representations of such
	dynamic systems. Here, we introduce a novel generalized analytical
	framework for temporal networks, which enables 1) robust evaluation of
	the efficiency of temporal information exchange using two new network
	metrics and 2) quantitative inspection of the temporal small-worldness.
	Specifically, we define new robust temporal network efficiency measures
	by incorporating the time dependency of temporal distance. We propose a
	temporal regular network model, and based on this plus the redefined
	temporal efficiency metrics and widely used temporal random network
	models, we introduce a quantitative approach for identifying temporal
	small-world architectures (featuring high temporal network efficiency
	both globally and locally). In addition, within this framework, we can
	uncover network-specific dynamic structures. Applications to brain
	networks, international trade networks, and social networks reveal
	prominent temporal small-world properties with distinct dynamic network
	structures. We believe that the framework can provide further insight
	into dynamic changes in the network topology of various real-world
	systems and significantly promote research on temporal networks.},

	Abstract = {Clustered structure of social networks provides the chances of repeated
	exposures to carriers with similar information. It is commonly believed
	that the impact of repeated exposures on the spreading of information is
	nontrivial. Does this effect increase the probability that an individual
	forwards a message in social networks? If so, to what extent does this
	effect influence people's decisions on whether or not to spread
	information? Based on a large-scale microblogging data set, which logs
	the message spreading processes and users' forwarding activities, we
	conduct a data-driven analysis to explore the answer to the above
	questions. The results show that an overwhelming majority of message
	samples are more probable to be forwarded under repeated exposures,
	compared to those under only a single exposure. For those message
	samples that cover various topics, we observe a relatively fixed,
	topic-independent multiplier of the willingness of spreading when
	repeated exposures occur, regardless of the differences in network
	structure. We believe that this finding reflects average people's
	intrinsic psychological gain under repeated stimuli. Hence, it makes
	sense that the gain is associated with personal response behavior,
	rather than network structure. Moreover, we find that the gain is robust
	against the change of message popularity. This finding supports that
	there exists a relatively fixed gain brought by repeated exposures.
	Based on the above findings, we propose a parsimonious model to predict
	the saturated numbers of forwarding activities of messages. Our work

	Abstract = {Background
	Globally, female street-based sex workers are vulnerable to gender-based
	violence. Previous research has shown having a peer social network can
	reduce sex workers' risks of victimization. However, mechanisms of how
	social network impacts violence among female street-based sex workers
	are still far from clear.
	Methods
	Our study was based on data abstracted from a paper-and-pencil survey
	administered among 218 female street-based sex workers in Shanghai,
	China. We focused on selfreported client-initiated violence and
	intimate-partner violence in emotional, physical, and sexual forms.
	Social networks were characterized by the size and sources of financial
	and psychosocial support (e.g. family, friends, and peers).
	Multi-variable logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds
	ratios (AOR) of each type of violence exposure by social network
	structure after the adjustment of age, education, and years in Shanghai.
	Results
	The street-based female sex workers in our study were primarily
	rural-to-urban migrants (95.7\%) with an average age of 41 years old.
	24.3\% and 62.8\% of the sex workers reported intimate-partner violence
	and client-initiated violence respectively. Lack of financial support,
	as defined by having only one individual or none in her peer support
	system to help financially, was significantly associated with
	self-reported intimate-partner violence (AOR: 2.5; 95\% CI: 1.1-5.9).
	Respondents who reported client-initiated violence, by contrast, were
	more likely to report lacked psychosocial support from family (AOR: 2.2,
	95\% CI: 1.0-4.6) and peers (AOR: 5.1, 95\% CI: 2.2-11).
	Conclusion
	This study is one of the first to systematically analyze the
	associations between social network and gender-based violence among
	street-based female sex worker. We reported a high prevalence of both
	types of gender-based violence and their complex associations with
	family, friends, and peer support network. Policies with goals to reduce
	violence against women may apply these findings to leverage social
	network in the interventions against gender-based violence.},

	network researchers expand their team size through getting connected to
	other experts of the field. This team size expansion may result in
	higher productivity of the whole team as a result of getting access to
	new resources, benefitting from the internal referring, and exchanging

	There are a number of applications of centrality, including inferring

	capture a node's prominence profile. We show that the proposed node
	prominence profile method is an effective predictor of degree
	centrality. Notably, our analysis reveals that individuals in the early

	assesses how a social network changes according to group fission-fusion
	dynamics. We built a model that was based on different parameters: the

	and the changes in the social network after a temporary fission. The
	results obtained from this theoretical data indicate how the percentage
	of social relation transfer, the number of individuals and the relative

	the nutritional needs and the higher the transfer of social relations

	We develop a ``colocation{''} network to distinguish the mobility
	patterns of an ego's social ties from those not socially connected to
	the ego but who arrive at a location at a similar time as the ego. Using
	entropic measures, we analyze and bound the predictive information of an

	the former generically provide more information, replacing up to 94\% of
	an ego's predictability, significant information is also present in the

	predictive information. Such information flow raises privacy concerns:
	individuals sharing data via mobile applications may be providing
	actionable information on themselves as well as others whose data are

	Information about an individual's mobility can leave traces embedded in

	political participation: cause-oriented, expressive, and networked.
	However, the pathway between environmental concern and environmental
	activism is complicated in some contexts and for some citizens. This
	article uses survey data from four countries (Canada, France, the United
	Kingdom, the United States) gathered in autumn 2019. We focus on the
	environmental activism of youth and young adults (aged 18-33 years, n =
	1574). We find the role of social media is consistent and strong for all
	environmental activities in all countries; the role of political
	efficacy depends on activity and country but has a positive role in
	environmental activism; and environmental concern is a positive and
	significant correlate of boycotting and signing petitions but a weak
	predictor of participating in environmental marches. The relationship
	between environmental concern and environmental marches is distinctive
	in the United Kingdom. Overall, we find that concern about a social
	cause does not automatically translate into increased activism related
	to that cause. Moreover, online social networks, political efficacy, and
	political context are critical to understanding this mobilization
	process.},

	they are better able to control the information flow within the

	Abstract = {Detection techniques of malicious content such as spam and phishing on
	Online Social Networks (OSN) are common with little attention paid to
	other types of low-quality content which actually impacts users' content
	browsing experience most. The aim of our work is to detect low-quality
	content from the users' perspective in real time. To define low-quality
	content comprehensibly, Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is first
	used to coarsely classify low-quality tweets into four categories. Based
	on this preliminary study, a survey is carefully designed to gather
	users' opinions on different categories of low-quality content. Both
	direct and indirect features including newly proposed features are
	identified to characterize all types of low-quality content. We then
	further combine word level analysis with the identified features and
	build a keyword blacklist dictionary to improve the detection
	performance. We manually label an extensive Twitter dataset of 100,000
	tweets and perform low-quality content detection in real time based on
	the characterized significant features and word level analysis. The
	results of our research show that our method has a high accuracy of
	0.9711 and a good F1 of 0.8379 based on a random forest classifier with
	real time performance in the detection of low-quality content in tweets.
	Our work therefore achieves a positive impact in improving user

	Abstract = {Most social interactions do not take place at random. In many
	situations, individuals choose their interaction partners on the basis
	of phenotypic cues. When this happens, individuals are often homophilic,
	that is, they tend to interact with individuals that are similar to
	them. Here we investigate the joint evolution of phenotypic cues and
	cue-dependent interaction strategies. By a combination of
	individual-based simulations and analytical arguments, we show that
	homophily evolves less easily than earlier studies suggest. The
	evolutionary interplay of cues and cue-based behaviour is intricate and
	has many interesting facets. For example, an interaction strategy like
	heterophily may stably persist in the population even if it is selected
	against in association with any particular cue. Homophily persisted for
	extensive periods of time just in those simulations where homophilic
	interactions provide a lower (rather than a higher) payoff than
	heterophilic interactions. Our results indicate that even the simplest

	Abstract = {The friendship paradox is the phenomenon that in social networks, people
	on average have fewer friends than their friends do. The generalized
	friendship paradox is an extension to attributes other than the number
	of friends. The friendship paradox and its generalized version have
	gathered recent attention due to the information they provide about
	network structure and local inequalities. In this paper, we propose
	several measures of nodal qualities which capture different aspects of
	their activities and influence in online social networks. Using these
	measures we analyse the prevalence of the generalized friendship paradox
	over Twitter and we report high levels of prevalence (up to over 90\% of
	nodes). We contend that this prevalence of the friendship paradox and
	its generalized version arise because of the hierarchical nature of the
	connections in the network. This hierarchy is nested as opposed to being
	star-like. We conclude that these paradoxes are collective phenomena not
	created merely by a minority of well-connected or high-attribute nodes.
	Moreover, our results show that a large fraction of individuals can
	experience the generalized friendship paradox even in the absence of a
	significant correlation between degrees and attributes.},

	Abstract = {Social network analysis (SNA) is well recognized as a tool for informing

	focus on quantitative structural analyses (how many nodes and ties
	exist, and between whom), rather than accessing richer information about
	their meaning (value content of ties). One way to improve the usefulness
	of SNA is to purposefully complement the structural analysis with
	cultural elements that can be drawn from field datasets. In this
	network-governance case study from Queensland, Australia, research on
	organizations involved in water management and flood responses events
	showed that cultural values were important in influencing network
	connections and preferred approaches to flood pre-planning and response.
	For example, there were differences in organizational preferences for
	the numbers and types of links that are rooted in different values. From
	this, Mary Douglas' Cultural Theory categories of individualists,
	hierarchists, and egalitarians were extended to analyze the types of
	ties between network nodes, the preferred approaches of different types
	of organization, and the problematic links and missing links among
	network nodes. This work illustrates that analyses of both structural
	SNA and cultural values can be used to improve regional-level adaptation
	activities such as disaster management. Here, increased knowledge about
	social networks, network ties, and cultural values can facilitate a

	ran a global social mobilization contest and recorded personal traits of
	the participants and those they recruited. We studied the effects of
	ascribed traits (gender, age) and acquired traits (geography, and
	information source) on the speed of mobilization. We found that
	homophily, a preference for interacting with other individuals with
	similar traits, had a mixed role in social mobilization. Homophily was
	present for acquired traits, in which mobilization speed was faster when
	the recuiter and recruit had the same trait compared to different
	traits. In contrast, we did not find support for homophily for the
	ascribed traits. Instead, those traits had other, non-homophily effects:
	Females mobilized other females faster than males mobilized other males.
	Younger recruiters mobilized others faster, and older recruits mobilized
	slower. Recruits also mobilized faster when they first heard about the
	contest directly from the contest organization, and decreased in speed
	when hearing from less personal source types (e. g. family vs. media).
	These findings show that social mobilization includes dynamics that are
	unlike other, more passive forms of social activity propagation. These
	findings suggest relevant factors for engineering social mobilization

	Abstract = {This article explores the plausibility of the conflicting theoretical
	assumptions underlying the main criminological perspectives on juvenile
	delinquents, their peer relations and social skills: the social ability
	model, represented by Sutherland's theory of differential associations,
	and the social disability model, represented by Hirschi's control
	theory. It does so by applying the principles associated with
	Granovetter's theory of strong and weak ties, drawing out its
	theoretical implications for the criminological theories and deriving a
	number of hypotheses. The article uses ``strategic research
	materials{''} in the form of a data set strongly biased towards the
	social disability model and containing information on co-offending
	relations among a population (N = 580) of juveniles in a Swedish town
	during a three-year period. Results from cross-sectional empirical
	analyses using, among other things, the Quadratic Assignment Procedure,
	clearly support the social ability model. The robustness of the initial
	analyses is checked through longitudinal analyses applying
	actor-oriented statistical models for network evolution. The article's
	implications for criminological, as well as multidisciplinary, research
	are discussed.},

	social referents that group members turn to for judgments about

	each referent depends on the group-level social network structure. The
	findings indicate that group members are more likely to have shared
	judgments with their cohesive and structurally equivalent referents
	within their advice network, and the strength of social influence form
	their cohesive and structurally equivalent referents is likely to depend
	on the advice network density at the group-level. However, there was no
	significant association in judgment similarity between group members and
	their central referents within the advice network. Overall, this study
	suggests that while social influence (in its most straightforward form)
	occurs between pairs of individuals, the strength of influence of a
	social referent is dependent on how social cues are distributed within

	are connected with low-centrality actors (i.e., low equicentrality), the

	Abstract = {To meet the challenges of customization and personalized design in the

	and the moderating effect of user expertise and network connectivity by

	Yet, the role of social networks has received little attention in
	empirical research seeking to explain the gender gap in job authority.
	This study examines to what extent gender differences in social networks
	exist and are related to the gender authority gap. Drawing on two
	strands of social network theory, we develop hypotheses about the role
	of network diversity and network status. We test these hypotheses using
	representative longitudinal data from the NEtherlands Longitudinal
	Lifecourse Study (2009-2013). Results reveal that women generally had
	less diverse occupational networks in terms of contacts' occupations and
	were less likely to know managers than men, network features which are
	found to be significantly related to job authority. Controlling for
	these gender differences in networks leads to a reduction of the

	Abstract = {The awareness about software vulnerabilities is crucial to ensure
	effective cybersecurity practices, the development of high-quality
	software, and, ultimately, national security. This awareness can be
	better understood by studying the spread, structure and evolution of
	software vulnerability discussions across online communities. This work
	is the first to evaluate and contrast how discussions about software
	vulnerabilities spread on three social platforms-Twitter, GitHub, and
	Reddit. Moreover, we measure how user-level e.g., bot or not, and
	content-level characteristics e.g., vulnerability severity, post
	subjectivity, targeted operating systems as well as social network
	topology influence the rate of vulnerability discussion spread. To lay
	the groundwork, we present a novel fundamental framework for measuring
	information spread in multiple social platforms that identifies spread
	mechanisms and observables, units of information, and groups of
	measurements. We then contrast topologies for three social networks and
	analyze the effect of the network structure on the way discussions about
	vulnerabilities spread. We measure the scale and speed of the discussion
	spread to understand how far and how wide they go, how many users
	participate, and the duration of their spread. To demonstrate the
	awareness of more impactful vulnerabilities, a subset of our analysis
	focuses on vulnerabilities targeted during recent major cyber-attacks
	and those exploited by advanced persistent threat groups. One of our
	major findings is that most discussions start on GitHub not only before
	Twitter and Reddit, but even before a vulnerability is officially
	published. The severity of a vulnerability contributes to how much it
	spreads, especially on Twitter. Highly severe vulnerabilities have
	significantly deeper, broader and more viral discussion threads. When
	analyzing vulnerabilities in software products we found that different
	flavors of Linux received the highest discussion volume. We also observe
	that Twitter discussions started by humans have larger size, breadth,
	depth, adoption rate, lifetime, and structural virality compared to
	those started by bots. On Reddit, discussion threads of positive posts
	are larger, wider, and deeper than negative or neutral posts. We also
	found that all three networks have high modularity that encourages
	spread. However, the spread on GitHub is different from other networks,
	because GitHub is more dense, has stronger community structure and
	assortativity that enhances information diffusion. We anticipate the
	results of our analysis to not only increase the understanding of
	software vulnerability awareness but also inform the existing and new
	analytical frameworks for simulating information spread e.g.,
	disinformation across multiple social environments online.},

	At the individual level, a consumer's decision consists of ``which

	product{''}. Individual product choices are affected by local and global
	social interactions among consumers. It would be helpful for firms to be

	Abstract = {Seventy years ago Paul Lazarsfeld and colleagues found empirical
	evidence for a significant influence of the social context on media
	effects by interpersonal communication. Subsequently various theories in
	mass media science incorporated the social context as an independent or
	dependent variable. However, there is little empirical research that
	addresses the dynamics of media use within a social context using
	network analytic methods. This study considers the social context as
	both an independent and dependent variable in a dynamic network process
	in order to disentangle social selection and influence processes. Hence,
	on one hand it tests whether the intensity of TV use and the use of
	specific TV genres predict the selection of conversation partners in
	social groups (social selection process). On the other hand it tests if
	individuals' social context predicts their TV use (social influence
	process). Here, social context is defined as the conversation structure
	as well as the media use of all other persons in the social group.
	The research design includes a four wave panel survey on interpersonal
	communication networks and TV use of 707 students (age 13-16) in 29
	Swiss school classes. The stochastic actor-based models tested with the
	program SIENA support the hypothesized selection processes. Conversation
	partners about TV programs are selected according to the similarity of
	their TV use. In contrast to this finding, the widely held assumption
	that individuals are influenced by their social network is not
	supported. Some inconclusive evidences suggest a possible social
	influence process on the level of TV intensity but not on the level of
	specific TV genres. Network-autocorrelation of conversation ties and TV
	use has therefore primarily be accredited to social selection processes
	and not social influence. Furthermore, the results show that avid
	viewers tend to talk more often about TV programs (ego effect), that
	avid viewers are more likely to be addressed (alter effect), and a
	general tendency to talk to persons with the same program preference
	(similarity effect). This challenges the classic idea of a two-step flow
	of communication in which intensive media users which are well informed
	would provide information to occasional users which are less conversant
	with a topic. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	correlations among the communications. Here, we study causality trees in
	mobile-phone data, which can be represented as a dynamical directed
	network. This representation of the data reveals the existence of
	super-spreaders and super-receivers. We show that the tree statistics,
	respectively the information spreading process, are extremely sensitive
	to the in-out degree correlation exhibited by the users. We also learn
	that a given information, e. g., a rumor, would require users to
	retransmit it for more than 30 hours in order to cover a macroscopic
	fraction of the system. Our analysis indicates that topological nodenode

	First, we evaluate whether structural characteristics of people's family
	and friend social networks are associated with involvement in local and
	extra-local civic participation. Second, we examine the interactions
	between social network attributes and personal characteristics on varied
	forms of participation.
	Methods
	We draw on data from a random-sample mail survey of 1,315 households.
	Results
	Attributes of friend and family social networks are related to civic
	participation beyond the influence of human capital; however, the
	results from family and friend networks are substantively different.
	There are also differences in the way attributes of social networks are
	associated with local versus extra-local participation. Finally, the
	interactions of human capital and social networks do not support
	previous research.
	Conclusions
	Overall, the evidence substantiates extant theory on the effects that
	social relations have on civic engagement. However, the structure and
	constituency of networks and the form of civic engagement play an
	important yet undertheorized role.},

	are segregated in terms of social capital. We test our argument with

	aged 18-75 years (n = 2,517) and build an integrated indicator of
	people's social class that combines measures of education, occupational

	counterparts. Interestingly, however, we found a U-shaped relationship
	between social class and class homogeneity, indicating that network
	segregation is high at the top as well as at the bottom of the
	class-based social strata. In contrast, the classes in the middle have
	more heterogeneous class networks, possibly forming an important bridge
	between the ``edges{''} of the class structure. These findings
	demonstrate that whereas social and economic capital cumulates in higher
	classes, the lower classes are socially deprived next to their economic

	Volume = {78},
	Month = {FEB},
	Abstract = {This paper utilizes a mixture of qualitative, formal, and statistical
	socio-semantic network analyses to examine how cultural homophily works
	when field logic meets practice. On the one hand, because individuals in
	similar field positions are also imposed with similar cultural
	orientations, cultural homophily reproduces `objective' field structure
	in intersubjective social network ties. On the other hand, fields are
	operative in practice and to accomplish pragmatic goals individuals who
	occupy different field positions often join in groups, creatively
	reinterpret the field-imposed cultural orientations, and produce
	cultural similarities alternative to the position-specific ones. Drawing
	on these emergent similarities, the cultural homophily mechanism might
	stimulate social network ties between members who occupy not the same
	but different field positions, thus contesting fields. I examine this
	ambivalent role of cultural homophily in two creative collectives, each
	embracing members positioned closer to the opposite poles of the field
	of cultural production. I find different types of cultural similarities
	to affect different types of social network ties within and between the
	field positions: Similarity of vocabularies stimulates friendship and
	collaboration ties within positions, thus reproducing the field, while
	affiliation with the same cultural structures stimulates collaboration
	ties between positions, thus contesting the field. The latter effect is
	visible under statistical analysis of ethnographic data, but easy to
	oversee in qualitative analysis of texts because informants tend to flag
	conformity to their positions in their explicit statements. This
	highlights the importance of mixed socio-semantic network analysis, both
	sensitive to the local context and capable of unveiling the mechanisms

	Abstract = {Social networks are often structured in such a way that there are gaps,
	or ``structural holes,{''} between regions. Some actors are in the
	position to bridge or span these gaps, giving rise to individual
	advantages relating to brokerage, gatekeeping, access to non-redundant
	contacts, and control over network flows. The most widely used measures
	of a given actor's bridging potential gauge the extent to which that
	actor is directly connected to others who are otherwise not well
	connected to each other. Unfortunately, the measures that have been
	developed to identify structural holes cannot be adapted directly to
	two-mode networks, like individual-to-organization networks. In two-mode
	networks, direct contacts cannot be directly connected to each other by
	definition, making the calculation of redundancy, effective size, and
	constraint impossible with conventional one-mode methods. We therefore
	describe a new framework for the measurement of bridging in two-mode
	networks that hinges on the mathematical concept of the intersection of
	sets. An actor in a given node class ({''}ego{''}) has bridging
	potential to the extent that s/he is connected to actors in the opposite
	node class that have unique profiles of connections to actors in ego's
	own node class. We review the relevant literature pertaining to
	structural holes in two-mode networks, and we compare our primary
	bridging measure (effective size) to measures of bridging that result
	when using one-mode projections of two-mode data. We demonstrate the
	results of applying our approach to empirical data on the organizational
	affiliations of elites in a large U.S. city. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

	Abstract = {Online social networks play an increasingly important role in
	communication between friends, colleagues, business partners, and family

	of cultural dissemination are powerful tools to study dynamics of

	traditional dyadic, face-to-face communication, rather than

	face-to-face communication, where actors update their cultural traits
	after being influenced by one of their network contacts, communication
	in online social networks is often characterized by a one-to-many
	structure, in that users emit messages directly to a large number of

	show that this seemingly subtle difference can have profound
	implications for emergent dynamics of cultural dissemination. In

	we were interested in the role that landscape structure plays in animal
	sociality at both individual (local) and population (global) levels. We
	used female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Illinois, USA,
	to investigate the potential effect of landscape on social network
	structure by weighting the edges of seasonal social networks with
	association rate (based on proximity inferred from GPS collar data). At
	the local level, we found that sociality among female deer in
	neighboring social groups (n = 36) was mainly explained by their home
	range overlap, with two exceptions: 1) during fawning in an area of
	mixed forest and grassland, deer whose home ranges had low forest
	connectivity were more social than expected; and 2) during the rut in an
	area of intensive agriculture, deer inhabiting home ranges with high
	amount and connectedness of agriculture were more social than expected.
	At the global scale, we found that deer populations (n = 7) in areas
	with highly connected forest-agriculture edge, a high proportion of
	agriculture, and a low proportion of forest tended to have higher
	weighted network closeness, although low sample size precluded
	statistical significance. This result implies that infectious disease
	could spread faster in deer populations inhabiting such landscapes. Our
	work advances the general understanding of animal social networks,
	demonstrating how landscape features can underlie differences in social
	behavior both within and among wildlife social networks.},

	Abstract = {Background
	Online social networks present wide-reaching and flexible platforms
	through which to deliver health interventions to targeted populations.
	This study used a social marketing approach to explore teenage girls'
	perceptions of physical activity and the potential use of online social
	networks to receive a physical activity intervention.
	Methods
	Six focus groups were conducted with 19 Australian teenage girls (ages
	13 to 18 years) with varying levels of physical activity and
	socioeconomic status. A semi-structured format was used, with groups
	discussion transcribed verbatim. Content analysis identified emergent
	themes, with triangulation and memos used to ensure accuracy.
	Results
	Physical activity was most appealing when it emphasised sport, exercise
	and fitness, along with opportunities for socialisation with friends and
	self-improvement. Participants were receptive to delivery of a physical
	activity intervention via online social networks, with Facebook the most
	widely reported site. Participants commonly accessed online social
	networks via mobile devices and particularly smartphones. Undesirable
	features included promotion of physical activity in terms of walking;
	use of cartoon imagery; use of humour; and promotion of the intervention
	via schools, each of which were considered ``uncool{''}. Participants
	noted that their parents were likely to be supportive of them using an
	online social networking physical activity intervention, particularly if
	not promoted as a weight loss intervention.
	Conclusion This study identified key features likely to increase the
	feasibility and retention of an online social networking physical
	activity intervention for teenage girls. Guidelines for the design of
	interventions for teenage girls are provided for future applications.},

	generations maintain a highly ritualized practice infused with notions
	of historical constructivism, polytemporality, diverse forms of exchange
	and kinship rivalry. Artifacts, food, information, memory and narratives
	are exchanged during the mushroom season. The veil of secrecy that
	surrounds mushroom-picking is only ever partially de-shrouded as
	misinformation, deceit and competition are widespread. The practice has
	become culturally proximate as an activity that links dispersed actors

	abandoned social spaces and activates networks of relations and
	knowledge. Thus, mushrooms not only help produce a dynamic social arena

	dependence theory and the concept of social capital, this paper reveals
	that different types of collaborative relationships exist within the

	China serves as a case in point. By evaluating network efficiency and
	classifying the collaborative relationships of involved government
	agencies, four types are identified: resource-redundant;
	resource-complementary; resource-dependent; and resource-isolated. The
	different influences of collaborative relationships explain why the

	the representation of minorities in top ranks when majorities are

	Abstract = {Social media play a key role in shaping citizens' political opinion.
	According to the Eurobarometer, the percentage of EU citizens employing
	online social networks on a daily basis has increased from 18\% in 2010
	to 48\% in 2019. The entwinement between social media and the unfolding
	of political dynamics has motivated the interest of researchers for the
	analysis of users online behavior-with particular emphasis on group
	polarization during debates and echo-chambers formation. In this
	context, semantic aspects have remained largely under-explored. In this
	paper, we aim at filling this gap by adopting a two-steps approach.
	First, we identify the discursive communities animating the political
	debate in the run up of the 2018 Italian Elections as groups of users
	with a significantly-similar retweeting behavior. Second, we study the
	mechanisms that shape their internal discussions by monitoring, on a
	daily basis, the structural evolution of the semantic networks they
	induce. Above and beyond specifying the semantic peculiarities of the
	Italian electoral competition, our approach innovates studies of online
	political discussions in two main ways. On the one hand, it grounds
	semantic analysis within users' behaviors by implementing a method,
	rooted in statistical theory, that guarantees that our inference of
	socio-semantic structures is not biased by any unsupported assumption
	about missing information; on the other, it is completely automated as
	it does not rest upon any manual labelling (either based on the users'
	features or on their sharing patterns). These elements make our method
	applicable to any Twitter discussion regardless of the language or the
	topic addressed.},

	thePersonal Digital Griefexperienced by migrants as a result of the loss

	Abstract = {The user interaction in online social networks can not only reveal the

	the social preferences of a target user for recommendation services.
	However, the current research has rarely explored the impact of social
	interaction on recommendation performance, especially now that
	recommender systems face increasing challenges and suffer from poor
	efficiency due to social data overload. Therefore, applied research on
	user interaction has become increasingly necessary in the field of
	social recommendation. In this paper, we develop a novel social
	recommendation method based on the user interaction in complex social
	networks, called the SRUI model, to present a basis for improving the
	efficiency of the recommender systems. Specifically, a weighted social
	interaction network is first mapped to represent the interactions among
	social users according to the gathered information about historical user
	behavior. Thereafter, the complete path set is mined by the complete
	path mining (CPM) algorithm to find social similar neighbors with tastes
	similar to those of the target user. Finally, the social similar
	tendencies of the users on the complete paths are obtained to predict
	the final ratings of items through the SRUI model. A series of
	experimental results based on two real public datasets show that our
	approach performs better than other state-of-the-art methods in terms of

	information at an incessant rate. In this paper we study the empirical
	data that crawled from Twitter to describe the topology and information
	spreading dynamics of Online Social Networks. We propose a measurement
	with three measures to state the efforts of users on Twitter to get
	their information spreading, based on the unique mechanisms for
	information retransmission on Twitter. It is noticed that small fraction
	of users with special performance on participation can gain great
	influence, while most other users play a role as middleware during the
	information propagation. Thus a community analysis is performed and four
	categories of users are found with different kinds of participation that
	cause the information dissemination dynamics. These suggest that exiting
	topological measures alone may reflect little about the influence of
	individuals and provide new insights for information spreading.},

	Abstract = {In this study, the theatre industry is conceived of as a field of
	cultural production, and analysed in the framework of Bourdieu's field
	theory and social network analysis (SNA). The theatrical field is
	formalized as an affiliation network of companies participating in stage
	co-productions in Italy's Campania region, over four theatre seasons.
	Differently from Bourdieu, but similarly to other works in the sociology
	of culture and the arts, the study focuses on relational and
	attribute-based dimensions of theatre production, presenting a novel way
	to combine field theory and SNA. By adopting the positional approach of
	SNA through Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), Multiple Factor
	Analysis (MFA) and blockmodeling for affiliation networks, the study
	reveals oppositions among companies by reason of their differential
	partnerships in co-productions, and a combination of hierarchy and
	segmentation characterizing the network structure of the field. These
	oppositions also appear in the `objective' social space defined by the
	attributes of companies and co productions (positions and
	position-takings), showing the unequal distribution of symbolic cultural
	capital among theatre producers and the latter's inclinations towards
	different theatrical styles and genres. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

	Abstract = {Statistical properties of the static networks have been extensively
	studied. However, online social networks are evolving dynamically,
	understanding the evolving characteristics of the core is one of major
	concerns in online social networks. In this paper, we empirically
	investigate the evolving characteristics of the Facebook core. Firstly,
	we separate the Facebook-link(FL) and Facebook-wall(FW) datasets into 28
	snapshots in terms of timestamps. By employing the k-core decomposition
	method to identify the core of each snapshot, we find that the core
	sizes of the FL and FW networks approximately contain about 672 and 373
	nodes regardless of the exponential growth of the network sizes.
	Secondly, we analyze evolving topological properties of the core,
	including the k-core value, assortative coefficient, clustering
	coefficient and the average shortest path length. Empirical results show
	that nodes in the core are getting more interconnected in the evolving
	process. Thirdly, we investigate the life span of nodes belonging to the
	core. More than 50\% nodes stay in the core for more than one year, and
	19\% nodes always stay in the core from the first snapshot. Finally, we
	analyze the connections between the core and the whole network, and find
	that nodes belonging to the core prefer to connect nodes with high
	k-core values, rather than the high degrees ones. This work could
	provide new insights into the online social network analysis.},

	accomplishment of routine (interactional stability) and ritual
	(interactional concord) and present two sets of analyses. The first
	analyses identify the antecedents to stability and concord, and the
	second examine how stability and concord shape the experiences and
	attitudes of classroom participants. Results indicate that activities

	in different ways, often meeting one at the expense of the other, and
	that the accomplishment of stability and concord has positive returns to

	Abstract = {When a pair of individuals is central to a research problem (e.g.,
	husband and wife, PhD student and supervisor) the concept of
	``duocentered{''} networks can be defined as a useful extension of
	egocentered networks. This new structure consists of a pair of central
	egos and their direct links with alters, instead of just one central ego
	as in the egocentered networks or multiple egos as in complete networks.
	The key point in this kind of network is that ties exist between the
	central pair of egos and between them and all alters, but the ties among
	alters are not considered. Duocentered networks can also be considered
	as a compromise between egocentered and complete networks. Complete
	network measurements are often costly to obtain and tend to contain a
	large proportion of missing data (especially for peripheral actors).
	Egocentered network data are less costly but a lot of information is
	lost with their use when a pair of individuals is the relevant unit of
	analysis.
	From the definition of duocentered networks, we develop new social
	network measures, some of which based on the measures for complete
	networks such as degree, closeness centrality or density, both absolute
	and relative, while others are tailored to dealing with specific
	characteristics of the duocentered network structures.
	The proposed measures are used in the analysis of the networks of
	Slovenian PhD students and their supervisors. We specify three
	regression models to predict PhD student's academic performance on the
	basis of these duocentered network measures for different relations such
	as advice, collaboration, emotional support, and trust. The results show
	that absolute duocentered measures predict performance best. When
	compared with egocentered network measures a higher predictive power of
	duocentered networks is revealed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

	as a driver of innovation growth, very few empirical studies have
	explicitly investigated the impact of social network structures on the
	innovation performance of cities. Past research has mostly explored
	scaling laws of socio-economic outputs of cities as determined by, for
	example, the single predictor of population. Here, by drawing on a
	publicly available dataset of the startup ecosystem, we build the first
	Workforce Mobility Network among metropolitan areas in the US. We found
	that node centrality computed on this network accounts for most of the
	variability observed in cities' innovation performance and significantly
	outperforms other predictors such as population size or density,
	suggesting that policies and initiatives aiming at sustaining innovation
	processes might benefit from fostering professional networks alongside
	other economic or systemic incentives. As opposed to previous approaches
	powered by census data, our model can be updated in real-time upon open
	databases, opening up new opportunities both for researchers in a
	variety of disciplines to study urban economies in new ways, and for
	practitioners to design tools for monitoring such economies in

	Abstract = {Even though the concept of tie strength is central in social network
	analysis, it is difficult to quantify how strong social ties are. One
	typical way of estimating tie strength in data-driven studies has been
	to simply count the total number or duration of contacts between two
	people. This, however, disregards many features that can be extracted
	from the rich data sets used for social network reconstruction. Here, we
	focus on contact data with temporal information. We systematically study
	how features of the contact time series are related to topological
	features usually associated with tie strength. We focus on a large
	mobile-phone dataset and measure a number of properties of the contact
	time series for each tie and use these to predict the so-called
	neighbourhood overlap, a feature related to strong ties in the
	sociological literature. We observe a strong relationship between
	temporal features and the neighbourhood overlap, with many features
	outperforming simple contact counts. Features that stand out include the
	number of days with calls, number of bursty cascades, typical times of
	contacts, and temporal stability. These are also seen to correlate with
	the overlap in diverse smaller communication datasets studied for
	reference. Taken together, our results suggest that such temporal
	features could be useful for inferring social network structure from

	Abstract = {The research on social network analysis established the existence of
	class homophily, the tendency that personal networks are homogeneous in
	the class sense, as one of the governing patterns. This is explained via
	two main mechanisms: choice homophily and induced homophily. But the
	literature focused less on the question how can class boundaries be
	transgressed and what are the channels of class heterophily. This paper
	explores class heterophily on Croatian data acquired through position
	generator, which measures social capital (resources captured in social
	relations) by exploring the range of different occupational positions
	which are accessible to an individual (extensity index). Network
	variability is thereby taken as proxy for class composition of personal
	networks. The paper concludes that that political participation and
	sociability enable cross-class ties, since this offers an opportunity to
	meet and befriend people from all walks of life; and that people on the
	middle of the social hierarchy have the most diverse social networks.
	The hypotheses that social mobility can represent a vehicle for class
	heterophily; and that class heterophily is more pronounced in smaller
	settlements, where society networks show more overlap between social
	circles; were confirmed only partially, and require further
	investigation. These findings concern class boundaries related to the
	notion of choice homophily. As for induced homophily, the paper
	concludes that here too the boundaries are not watertight, as cultural
	omnivores have a wider range of class contacts.},

	These methods have mainly been utilized to explore evolutionary changes

	social status and social networks in an enterprise. We study whether
	enterprise communication logs can help reveal how social interactions
	and individual status manifest themselves in social networks. To that
	end, we use two enterprise datasets with three communication
	channels-voice call, short message, and email-to demonstrate the
	social-behavioral differences among individuals with different status.
	We have several interesting findings and based on these findings we also
	develop a model to predict social status. On the individual level,

	Abstract = {From many datasets gathered in online social networks, well defined
	community structures have been observed. A large number of users
	participate in these networks and the size of the resulting graphs poses
	computational challenges. There is a particular demand in identifying
	the nodes responsible for information flow between communities; for
	example, in temporal Twitter networks edges between communities play a
	key role in propagating spikes of activity when the connectivity between
	communities is sparse and few edges exist between different clusters of
	nodes. The new algorithm proposed here is aimed at revealing these key
	connections by measuring a node's vicinity to nodes of another
	community. We look at the nodes which have edges in more than one
	community and the locality of nodes around them which influence the
	information received and broadcasted to them. The method relies on
	independent random walks of a chosen fixed number of steps, originating
	from nodes with edges in more than one community. For the large networks
	that we have in mind, existing measures such as betweenness centrality
	are difficult to compute, even with recent methods that approximate the
	large number of operations required. We therefore design an algorithm
	that scales up to the demand of current big data requirements and has
	the ability to harness parallel processing capabilities. The new
	algorithm is illustrated on synthetic data, where results can be judged
	carefully, and also on a real, large scale Twitter activity data, where
	new insights can be gained.},

	Abstract = {Background: Crowd-powered search is a new form of search and problem
	solving scheme that involves collaboration among a potentially large
	number of voluntary Web users. Human flesh search (HFS), a particular
	form of crowd-powered search originated in China, has seen tremendous
	growth since its inception in 2001. HFS presents a valuable test-bed for
	scientists to validate existing and new theories in social computing,
	sociology, behavioral sciences, and so forth.
	Methodology: In this research, we construct an aggregated HFS group,
	consisting of the participants and their relationships in a
	comprehensive set of identified HFS episodes. We study the topological
	properties and the evolution of the aggregated network and different
	sub-groups in the network. We also identify the key HFS participants
	according to a variety of measures.
	Conclusions: We found that, as compared with other online social
	networks, HFS participant network shares the power-law degree
	distribution and small-world property, but with a looser and more
	distributed organizational structure, leading to the diversity,
	decentralization, and independence of HFS participants. In addition, the
	HFS group has been becoming increasingly decentralized. The comparisons
	of different HFS sub-groups reveal that HFS participants collaborated
	more often when they conducted the searches in local platforms or the
	searches requiring a certain level of professional knowledge background.
	On the contrary, HFS participants did not collaborate much when they
	performed the search task in national platforms or the searches with
	general topics that did not require specific information and learning.
	We also observed that the key HFS information contributors, carriers,
	and transmitters came from different groups of HFS participants.},

	discoveries in astrophysics led to a major restructuring of the elite

	grounding and the social network structure of a discipline, a
	mixed-methods approach is necessary. It combines scientometrics,
	quantitative network analysis and visualization tools with a qualitative
	network analysis approach. The centre of the international collaboration
	network of astrophysics is demarcated by identifying the 225 most
	productive astrophysicists. For the years 1998-1999 and 2001-2006 four
	co-authorship networks are constructed comprehending each a two year
	period. A visualization of the longitudinal network data gives first
	hints on the structural development of the network. The network of
	2005-2006 is analyzed in depth. Based on cohesion analysis tools for
	network analysis, two main cores and three smaller ones are identified.
	Scientists in each core and additionally in structurally interesting
	positions are identified and 17 qualitative expert interviews are
	conducted with them. The visualization of the network of 2005-2006 is
	used in the interviews as a stimulus for the interviewees. An analysis
	of the three most often used keywords of the 225 astrophysicists is
	included and combined with the other data. The triangulation of these
	approaches shows that major epistemic changes in astrophysics, e.g. the
	discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe, together with
	technical and organizational innovations, leads to a restructuring of
	the network of the discipline. The importance of a combination of
	qualitative and quantitative network analysis tools for the
	understanding of the interplay of cognitive and social structure in the
	sociology of science is substantiated.},

	For dynamic SNA, shorter segments of network data are used in the

	analysis, the prominence of actors is characterized and compared in the

	(i.e., using dynamic topology) of a complex email network in a large

	capture the network behavior completely, there are particular situations
	where the additional description provided by dynamic analysis is not
	significant. The limitations of dynamic topological SNA are discussed
	and we stress the importance of associating function with network
	structure in moving towards a more informative dynamical description.

	Abstract = {In recent years, short videos have become an increasingly vital source
	of information. To compete for users' attention, short video platforms
	have been overusing algorithmic technology, making the group
	polarization intensify, which is likely to push users into the
	homogeneous ``echo chamber{''}. However, echo chambers can contribute to
	the spread of misleading information, false news, or rumors, which have
	negative social impacts. Therefore, it is necessary to explore echo
	chamber effects in short video platforms. Moreover, the communication
	paradigms between users and feed algorithms greatly vary across short
	video platforms. This paper investigated echo chamber effects of three
	popular short video platforms (Douyin, TikTok, and Bilibili) using
	social network analysis and explored how user features influenced the
	generation of echo chambers. We quantified echo chamber effects through
	two primary ingredients: selective exposure and homophily, in both
	platform and topic dimensions. Our analyses indicate that the gathering
	of users into homogeneous groups dominates online interactions on Douyin
	and Bilibili. We performed performance comparison of echo chamber
	effects and found that echo chamber members tend to display themselves
	to attract the attention of their peers and that cultural differences
	can prevent the development of echo chambers. Our findings are of great
	value in designing targeted management strategies to prevent the spread
	of misleading information, false news, or rumors.},

	Abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs) offer new means for political
	communications that have quickly begun to play crucial roles in
	political campaigns, due to their pervasiveness and communication speed.
	However, the OSN environment is quite slippery and hides potential
	risks: many studies presented evidence about the presence of
	d/misinformation campaigns and malicious activities by genuine or
	automated users, putting at severe risk the efficiency of online and
	offline political campaigns. This phenomenon is particularly evident
	during crucial political events, as political elections. In the present
	paper, we provide a comprehensive description of the networks of
	interactions among users and bots during the UK elections of 2019. In
	particular, we focus on the polarised discussion about Brexit on
	Twitter, analysing a data set made of more than 10 millions tweets
	posted for over a month. We found that the presence of automated
	accounts infected the debate particularly in the days before the UK
	national elections, in which we find a steep increase of bots in the
	discussion; in the days after the election day, their incidence returned
	to values similar to the ones observed few weeks before the elections.
	On the other hand, we found that the number of suspended users (i.e.
	accounts that were removed by the platform for some violation of the
	Twitter policy) remained constant until the election day, after which it
	reached significantly higher values. Remarkably, after the TV debate
	between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, we observed the injection of a
	large number of novel bots whose behaviour is markedly different from
	that of pre-existing ones. Finally, we explored the bots' political
	orientation, finding that their activity is spread across the whole
	political spectrum, although in different proportions, and we studied
	the different usage of hashtags and URLs by automated accounts and
	suspended users, targeting the formation of common narratives in
	different sides of the debate.},

	collected three-year-long high-resolution data on its evolution along
	with the price of its main cryptocurrencies. On users' activities
	extracted from these longitudinal data, we applied a time-series
	correlation analysis and a correlation analysis between the action
	allocation strategies and the obtained rewards, in the case of most
	central accounts. The analysis has highlighted pieces of evidence of the
	influence of the cryptocurrency price on users' actions, particularly on
	actions that shape the structure of the social networks. Second, we also
	found highly rewarded users prefer actions related to the promotion of
	content rather than the creation of high-quality content, exploiting the
	reward distribution mechanisms implemented by the platform. These
	findings highlight that the shift of paradigm towards blockchain and

	Abstract = {Diffusion on networks is an important concept in network science
	observed in many situations such as information spreading and rumor
	controlling in social networks, disease contagion between individuals,
	and cascading failures in power grids. The critical interactions in
	networks play critical roles in diffusion and primarily affect network
	structure and functions. While interactions can occur between two nodes
	as pairwise interactions, i.e., edges, they can also occur between three
	or more nodes, which are described as higher-order interactions. This
	report presents a novel method to identify critical higher-order
	interactions in complex networks. We propose two new Laplacians to
	generalize standard graph centrality measures for higher-order
	interactions. We then compare the performances of the generalized
	centrality measures using the size of giant component and the
	Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) simulation model to show the
	effectiveness of using higher-order interactions. We further compare
	them with the first-order interactions (i.e., edges). Experimental
	results suggest that higher-order interactions play more critical roles
	than edges based on both the size of giant component and SIR, and the
	proposed methods are promising in identifying critical higher-order
	interactions.},

	overembeddedness-a state of excessive interconnectedness among market

	online markets with aggregate consequences for short-term gross illegal
	revenue. Drawing on transaction-level data on 16 847 illegal drug
	transactions over 14 months of trade in a `darknet' drug market, we
	assess how repeated exchanges and closure in buyer-vendor trade networks
	nonlinearly influence prices and short-term gross revenue from illegal
	drug trade. Using a series of panel models, we find that increases in
	closure and repeated exchange raise prices until a threshold is reached
	upon which prices and gross monthly revenue begin to decline as networks
	become overembedded. Findings provide insight into the network
	determinants of prices and gross monthly revenue in illegal online drug
	trade and illustrate how network structure shapes prices in criminal
	markets, even in anonymous trade environments.},

	The aim of this study is to understand the evolution of social
	organization in Drosophila. Using a comparative ecological,
	phylogenetic, and behavioral approach, the different properties of SINs
	formed by 20 drosophilids were compared. We investigate whether
	drosophilid network structures arise from common ancestry, a response to
	the species' past climate, other social behaviors, or a combination of
	these factors. This study shows that differences in past climate
	predicted the species' current SIN properties. The drosophilid phylogeny
	offered no value to predicting species' differences in SINs through
	phylogenetic signal tests. This suggests that group-level social
	behaviors in drosophilid species are shaped by divergent climates.
	However, we find that the social distance at which flies interact
	correlated with the drosophilid phylogeny, indicating that behavioral
	elements of SINs have remained largely unchanged in their evolutionary
	history. We find a significant correlation of leg length to social
	distance, outlining the interdependence of anatomy and complex social
	structures. Although SINs display a complex evolutionary relationship
	across drosophilids, this study suggests that the ecology, and not
	common ancestry, contributes to diversity in social structure in

	Abstract = {The honeybee (Apis mellifera) dance communication system is a marvel of
	collective behaviour, but the added value it brings to colony foraging
	efficiency is poorly understood. In temperate environments, preventing
	communication of foraging locations rarely decreases colony food intake,
	potentially because simultaneous transmission of olfactory information
	also plays a major role in foraging. Here, we employ social network
	analyses that quantify information flow across multiple temporally
	varying networks (each representing a different interaction type) to
	evaluate the relative contributions of dance communication and
	hive-based olfactory information transfer to honeybee recruitment
	events. We show that virtually all successful recruits to novel
	locations rely upon dance information rather than olfactory cues that
	could otherwise guide them to the same resource. Conversely, during
	reactivation to known sites, dances are relatively less important, as
	foragers are primarily guided by olfactory information. By disentangling
	the contributions of multiple information networks, the contexts in
	which dance communication truly matters amid a complex system full of
	redundancy can now be identified.
	Honeybees have a sophisticated system to communicate foraging locations
	through a ``dance{''}, but they also share food-related olfactory cues.
	Here, Hasenjager and colleagues use social network analysis to
	disentangle how foraging information is transmitted through these

	Abstract = {Background
	Older adults' discussions with family, or with physicians, or with both,
	about advance care planning (ACP) are increasingly regarded as important
	for the management of end-of-life care, and yet the factors that induce
	older adults to engage in ACP discussions are poorly understood. For
	example, in older adults, is stronger connectedness with family and
	friends (stronger ``networks{''}) associated with ACP discussions? By
	facilitating, or by impeding ACP discussions? We sought to evaluate the
	associations between ACP discussions and social networks in Japanese
	older adults.
	Methods
	In July 2016 we conducted a cross-sectional survey on 355
	community-dwelling patients aged. 65 years visiting community hospital
	clinics in Fukushima, Japan. We used the Lubben Social Network Scale
	(LSNS-6, the shortest available LSNS scale) to assess social networks
	and recorded two components of social network structure, marital status
	(dichotomized as ``married{''} vs. ``single / other{''}) and living
	status ({''}living with others{''} vs. ``living alone{''}). One item
	asked if patients had had ACP discussions. We analyzed the LSNS-6 social
	network and marital and living status data in relation to the occurrence
	of ACP discussions using multiple logistic regression models with
	adjustments for possible confounding factors.
	Results
	Respondents' social network was ``limited{''} in 16\% of cases; 61\% had
	had ACP discussions. Respondents with a limited social network had a
	significantly lower tendency to have had ACP discussions than
	respondents with an ``adequate{''} social network (adjusted odds ratio
	{[}AOR]: 0.35; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.18-0.66; P < 0.001).
	Marital status and living status were not significantly associated with
	ACP discussion.
	Conclusions
	Among Japanese older adults, weaker social networks may be associated
	with a lower tendency to discuss ACP. Our findings may help
	practitioners to quickly screen populations at risk for inadequate ACP
	discussion by using the LSNS-6.},

	building features. Using a multistage investigation, this study has
	developed and validated a 25-item instrument for investigating the
	various reasons why young people avoid Facebook photo tagging. The
	instrument items were developed based on open-ended qualitative essays
	written by 141 Indian and Pakistani adolescents who use the Facebook
	photo-tagging service. From their qualitative responses, 38 items were
	first extracted and evaluated with 780 Indian adolescent photo taggers.
	This resulted in the development of a 25-item instrument which was
	reexamined a year later with 314 Indian adolescent and 106 young adult
	photo taggers. The study participants were recruited from India and
	Pakistan in order to address the criticism of previous Facebook research
	which is chiefly based on U.S.-only study samples. The developed
	instrument indicated six reasons: destruction of capital, dislike,
	worry, parental control, embarrassment, and personal appearance. The
	study results indicate that the developed instrument has a stable
	factorial structure, validity, and reliability over time. This new
	instrument offers various theoretical and practical implications for
	scholars engaged in research involving computer-mediated communication,

	defines a measure for each county, that correlates significantly with
	employment (0.46 +/- 0.02) and unemployment rates (-0.34 +/- 0.02).
	Thus, the two dominant activity patterns can be linked to rhythms

	a collaborative disclosure that relies on others' cooperation to
	maintain the boundaries between private and public space. Based on these

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a semantic approach for monitoring information
	published on social networks about a specific event. In the era of Big
	Data, when an emergency occurs information posted on social networks
	becomes more and more helpful for emergency operators. As direct
	witnesses of the situation, people share photos, videos or text messages
	about events that call their attention. In the emergency operation
	center, these data can be collected and integrated within the management
	process to improve the overall understanding of the situation and in
	particular of the citizen reactions. To support the tracking and
	analyzing of social network activities, there are already monitoring
	tools that combine visualization techniques with geographical maps.
	However, tweets are written from the perspective of citizens and the
	information they provide might be inaccurate, irrelevant or false. Our
	approach tries to deal with data relevance proposing an innovative
	ontology-based method for filtering tweets and extracting meaningful
	topics depending on their semantic content. In this way data become
	relevant for the operators to make decisions. Two real cases used to
	test its applicability showed that different visualization techniques
	might be needed to support situation awareness. This ontology-based
	approach can be generalized for analyzing the information flow about
	other domains of application changing the underlying knowledge base.},

	Abstract = {Background: The goal of this research is to determine if different
	gender-preferred social styles can be observed within the user
	interactions at an online cancer community. To achieve this goal, we
	identify and measure variables that pertain to each gender-specific
	social style.
	Methods and Findings: We perform social network and statistical analysis
	on the communication flow of 8,388 members at six different cancer
	forums over eight years. Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to measure
	the difference between the number of intimate (and highly intimate)
	dyads, relationship length, and number of communications. We determine
	that two patients are more likely to form an intimate bond on a
	gender-specific cancer forum (ovarian P = <0.0001, breast P = 0.0089,
	prostate P = 0.0021). Two female patients are more likely to form a
	highly intimate bond on a female-specific cancer forum (Ovarian P <
	0.0001, Breast P < 0.01). Typically a male patient communicates with
	more members than a female patient (Ovarian forum P = 0.0406, Breast
	forum P = 0.0013). A relationship between two patients is longer on the
	gender-specific cancer forums than a connection between two members not
	identified as patients (ovarian forum P = 0.00406, breast forum P =
	0.00013, prostate forum P = .0.0003).
	Conclusion: : The high level of interconnectedness among the prostate
	patients supports the hypothesis that men prefer to socialize in large,
	interconnected, less-intimate groups. A female patient is more likely to
	form a highly intimate connection with another female patient; this
	finding is consistent with the hypothesis that woman prefer fewer, more
	intimate connections. The relationships of same-gender cancer patients
	last longer than other relationships; this finding demonstrates
	homophily within these online communities. Our findings regarding online
	communication preferences are in agreement with research findings from
	person-to-person communication preference studies. These findings should
	be considered when designing online communities as well as designing and
	evaluating psychosocial and educational interventions for cancer
	patients.},

	documented how the interaction between mental models and incoming
	messages seems to be crucially important for their adoption or
	rejection. Some computational social science modelers analyze
	agent-based models where individuals do have simulated cognition, but
	they often lack the strengths of network science, namely in
	empirically-driven network structures. We introduce a cognitive cascade
	model that combines a network science belief cascade approach with an
	internal cognitive model of the individual agents as in opinion
	diffusion models as a public opinion diffusion (POD) model, adding media
	institutions as agents which begin opinion cascades. We show that the
	model, even with a very simplistic belief function to capture cognitive
	effects cited in disinformation study (dissonance and exposure), adds
	expressive power over existing cascade models. We conduct an analysis of
	the cognitive cascade model with our simple cognitive function across
	various graph topologies and institutional messaging patterns. We argue
	from our results that population-level aggregate outcomes of the model
	qualitatively match what has been reported in COVID-related public
	opinion polls, and that the model dynamics lend insights as to how to
	address the spread of problematic beliefs. The overall model sets up a
	framework with which social science misinformation researchers and
	computational opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to understand,
	and hopefully learn how to best counter, the spread of disinformation
	and ``alternative facts.{''}},

	Abstract = {Homophily, or the tendency for social contact to occur among those who
	are similar, plays a crucial role in structuring our social networks.
	Most previous work considers whether homophily shapes the patterns of
	all social ties, regardless of their frequency of interaction or level
	of intimacy. As complex network data become increasingly available,
	however, researchers need to evaluate whether homophily operates
	differently for ties defined by strong versus weak measures of strength.
	Here, I take this approach by first defining two variants of homophily:
	(1) strong tie homophily, or the tendency for ties with high measures of
	strength to cluster together similar peers, and (2) weak tie homophily,
	or the tendency for ties with low edge weights to connect sameattribute
	actors. Then, I apply valued ERGMs to demonstrate the utility of
	differentiating between the two variants across simulated and observed
	networks. In most networks, I find that there are observable differences
	in the magnitude of strong versus weak tie homophily. Additionally, when
	there are low levels of clustering on the attribute of interest,
	distinguishing between strong and weak tie homophily can reveal that
	these processes operate in opposite directions. Since strong and weak
	ties carry substantively different implications, I argue that
	differentiating between the two homophily variants has the potential to
	uncover novel insights on a variety of social phenomena.},

	Abstract = {Conspiracy theories in social networks are considered to have adverse
	effects on individuals' compliance with public health measures in the
	context of a pandemic situation. A deeper understanding of how
	conspiracy theories propagate through social networks is critical for
	the development of countermeasures. The present work focuses on a novel
	approach to characterize the propagation of conspiracy theories through
	social networks by applying epidemiological models to Twitter data. A
	Twitter dataset was searched for tweets containing hashtags indicating
	belief in the ``5GCoronavirus{''} conspiracy theory, which states that
	the COVID-19 pandemic is a result of, or enhanced by, the enrollment of
	the 5G mobile network. Despite the absence of any scientific evidence,
	the ``5GCoronavirus{''} conspiracy theory propagated rapidly through
	Twitter, beginning at the end of January, followed by a peak at the
	beginning of April, and ceasing/disappearing approximately at the end of
	June 2020. An epidemic SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model was
	fitted to this time series with acceptable model fit, indicating
	parallels between the propagation of conspiracy theories in social
	networks and infectious diseases. Extended SIR models were used to
	simulate the effects that two specific countermeasures, fact-checking
	and tweet-deletion, could have had on the propagation of the conspiracy
	theory. Our simulations indicate that fact-checking is an effective
	mechanism in an early stage of conspiracy theory diffusion, while
	tweet-deletion shows only moderate efficacy but is less time-sensitive.
	More generally, an early response is critical to gain control over the
	spread of conspiracy theories through social networks. We conclude that
	an early response combined with strong fact-checking and a moderate
	level of deletion of problematic posts is a promising strategy to fight
	conspiracy theories in social networks. Results are discussed with
	respect to their theoretical validity and generalizability.},

	Abstract = {Romania and Ukraine share the Black Sea coastline, the Danube Delta and
	associated habitats, which harbor the endemic, aquatic Pontocaspian
	biota. Currently, this biota is diminishing both in numbers of species
	and their abundance because of human activities, and its future
	persistence strongly depends on the adequacy of conservation measures.
	Romania and Ukraine have a common responsibility to address the
	conservation of Pontocaspian biodiversity. The two countries, however
	have different socio-political and legal conservation frameworks, which
	may result in differences in the social network structure of stakeholder
	institutions with different implications for Pontocaspian biodiversity
	conservation. Here, we study the social network structure of stakeholder
	organizations involved in conservation of Pontocaspian biodiversity in
	Romania and the implications of network structure for conservation
	outcomes. Then we compare the findings from Romania to an earlier
	similar study from Ukraine. We apply a mix of qualitative and
	quantitative social network analysis methods to combine the content and
	context of the interactions with relational measures. We show that
	Pontocaspian biodiversity plays a minor and mostly incidental role in
	the inter-organizational interactions in Romania. Furthermore, there is
	room for improvement in the network structure through e.g. more
	involvement of governmental and nongovernmental organizations and
	increased motivation of central stakeholders to initiate conservation
	actions. Social variables, such as lack of funding, hierarchical,
	non-inclusive system of conservation governance and continuous
	institutional reforms in the public sector are consequential for the
	network relations and structure. Social network of stakeholders in
	Ukraine is more connected and central stakeholders utilize their
	favorable positions. However, neither in Ukraine is the Pontocaspian
	biodiversity a driver of organizational interactions. Consequently, both
	networks translate into sub-optimal conservation actions and the roads
	to optimal conservation are different. We end with sketching out
	conservation implications and recommendations for improved national and
	cross-border conservation efforts.},

	context of guanxi. This article discovers that likes are reimagined as a
	digital gift of renqing representing targeted attention from specific
	giver-identities that generates circuits of likes exchanged between
	participants for tie-maintenance and tie-formation. For weak ties, lower
	frequency of reciprocity and sense of obligation were reported, whereas
	strong ties engendered reports of higher frequency of reciprocity and
	sense of obligation. However, across all dyadic guanxi ties,
	participants felt a constant renqing debt demanding repayment. As such,
	participants felt the need for some baseline frequency of like exchange
	and offended when alters neglected reciprocity altogether, yet continued
	giving likes for fear of damaging their reputation and relationship.
	Thus, mianzi is reconceptualized as embedded in interpersonal
	evaluations of one's reputation based on how well they maintain
	relationships and bound up in the social interactive tendency to
	exchange renqing over time. These webs of meaning and exchange encircle
	the objective of maintaining relationships by invigorating their
	emotional content. Here, the non-verbality of likes deepened their
	ability to replicate the raw, emotive charge of renqing: stripped of the
	burdensome complexities of verbal communication, likes convey a simple,
	one-dimensional, powerful sentiment of agreement that, in participants'
	experiences, is useful to generating future exchanges of likes and
	improving online relationships enough to create relationships offline as

	Abstract = {Real-world social networks often exhibit high levels of clustering,
	positive degree assortativity, short average path lengths (small-world
	property) and right-skewed but rarely power law degree distributions. On
	the other hand homophily, defined as the propensity of similar agents to
	connect to each other, is one of the most fundamental social processes
	observed in many human and animal societies. In this paper we examine
	the extent to which homophily is sufficient to produce the typical
	structural properties of social networks. To do so, we conduct a
	simulation study based on the Social Distance Attachment (SDA) model, a
	particular kind of Random Geometric Graph (RGG), in which nodes are
	embedded in a social space and connection probabilities depend
	functionally on distances between nodes. We derive the form of the model
	from first principles based on existing analytical results and argue
	that the mathematical construction of RGGs corresponds directly to the
	homophily principle, so they provide a good model for it. We find that
	homophily, especially when combined with a random edge rewiring, is
	sufficient to reproduce many of the characteristic features of social
	networks. Additionally, we devise a hybrid model combining SDA with the
	configuration model that allows generating homophilic networks with
	arbitrary degree sequences and we use it to study interactions of
	homophily with processes imposing constraints on degree distributions.
	We show that the effects of homophily on clustering are robust with
	respect to distribution constraints, while degree assortativity can be
	highly dependent on the particular kind of enforced degree sequence.},

	Abstract = {Social interactions among humans create complex networks and - despite a
	recent increase of online communication - the interactions mediated
	through physical proximity remain a fundamental way for people to
	connect. A common way to quantify the nature of the links between
	individuals is to consider repeated interactions: frequently occurring
	interactions indicate strong ties, such as friendships, while ties with
	low weights can indicate random encounters. Here we focus on a different
	dimension: rather than the strength of links, we study physical distance
	between individuals when a link is activated. The findings presented
	here are based on a dataset of proximity events in a population of
	approximately 500 individuals. To quantify the impact of the physical
	proximity on the dynamic network, we use a simulated epidemic spreading
	processes in two distinct networks of physical proximity. We consider
	the network of short-range interactions defined as d less than or
	similar to 1 meter, and the long-range which includes all interactions d
	less than or similar to 10 meters. Since these two networks arise from
	the same set of underlying behavioral data, we are able to
	quantitatively measure how the specific definition of the proximity
	network - short-range versus long-range - impacts the resulting network
	structure as well as spreading dynamics in epidemic simulations. We find
	that the short-range network - consistent with the literature - is
	characterized by densely-connected neighborhoods bridged by weak ties.
	More surprisingly, however, we show that spreading in the long-range
	network is quite different, mainly shaped by spurious interactions.},

	matter. We construe removal in terms of two case-deletion strategies:
	the tie-variables of an actor are assumed to be unobserved, or the node
	is removed resulting in the induced subgraph. We define the difference
	in inferred model resulting from case deletion from the perspective of
	information theory and difference in estimates, in both the natural and
	mean-value parameterisation, representing varying degrees of
	approximation. We arrive at several measures of influence and propose
	the use of two that do not require refitting of the model and lend
	themselves to routine application in the ERGM fitting procedure. MCMC p
	values are obtained for testing how extreme each node is with respect to

	information diffusion based on the network structure and time
	occupation. By taking into consideration the availability of a user,
	e.g., his online or offline state, we present the discrete-time
	bi-probability independent cascade model. We next analyse the
	information diffusion from a macro perspective. A diffusion model is
	established by merging the interferences from other events and the
	cumulative effect that occurs over time. Finally, we observe the factors
	in online social networks that impact a message's diffusion from a micro
	perspective and discuss more complex user behaviour and various types of
	interferences with their effects from a macro perspective. Experiments
	are conducted with real world data, and the experimental results justify

	Abstract = {The peer-to-peer (P2P) economy relies on establishing trust in
	distributed networked systems, where the reliability of a user is
	assessed through digital peer-review processes that aggregate ratings
	into reputation scores. Here we present evidence of a network effect
	which biases digital reputation, revealing that P2P networks display
	exceedingly high levels of reciprocity. In fact, these are much higher
	than those compatible with a null assumption that preserves the
	empirically observed level of agreement between all pairs of nodes, and
	rather close to the highest levels structurally compatible with the
	networks' reputation landscape. This indicates that the crowdsourcing
	process underpinning digital reputation can be significantly distorted
	by the attempt of users to mutually boost reputation, or to retaliate,
	through the exchange of ratings. We uncover that the least active users
	are predominantly responsible for such reciprocity-induced bias, and
	that this fact can be exploited to obtain more reliable reputation
	estimates. Our findings are robust across different P2P platforms,
	including both cases where ratings are used to vote on the content

	Abstract = {Hierarchy is one of the most conspicuous features of numerous natural,
	technological and social systems. The underlying structures are
	typically complex and their most relevant organizational principle is
	the ordering of the ties among the units they are made of according to a
	network displaying hierarchical features. In spite of the abundant
	presence of hierarchy no quantitative theoretical interpretation of the
	origins of a multi-level, knowledge-based social network exists. Here we
	introduce an approach which is capable of reproducing the emergence of a
	multi-levelled network structure based on the plausible assumption that
	the individuals (representing the nodes of the network) can make the
	right estimate about the state of their changing environment to a
	varying degree. Our model accounts for a fundamental feature of
	knowledge-based organizations: the less capable individuals tend to
	follow those who are better at solving the problems they all face. We
	find that relatively simple rules lead to hierarchical self-organization
	and the specific structures we obtain possess the two, perhaps most
	important features of complex systems: a simultaneous presence of
	adaptability and stability. In addition, the performance (success score)
	of the emerging networks is significantly higher than the average
	expected score of the individuals without letting them copy the
	decisions of the others. The results of our calculations are in
	agreement with a related experiment and can be useful from the point of
	designing the optimal conditions for constructing a given complex social
	structure as well as understanding the hierarchical organization of such
	biological structures of major importance as the regulatory pathways or
	the dynamics of neural networks.},

	Abstract = {Although the structural properties of online social networks have
	attracted much attention, the properties of the close-knit friendship
	structures remain an important question. Here, we mainly focus on how
	these mesoscale structures are affected by the local and global
	structural properties. Analyzing the data of four large-scale online
	social networks reveals several common structural properties. It is
	found that not only the local structures given by the indegree,
	outdegree, and reciprocal degree distributions follow a similar scaling
	behavior, the mesoscale structures represented by the distributions of
	close-knit friendship structures also exhibit a similar scaling law. The
	degree correlation is very weak over a wide range of the degrees. We
	propose a simple directed network model that captures the observed
	properties. The model incorporates two mechanisms: reciprocation and
	preferential attachment. Through rate equation analysis of our model,
	the local-scale and mesoscale structural properties are derived. In the
	local-scale, the same scaling behavior of indegree and outdegree
	distributions stems from indegree and outdegree of nodes both growing as
	the same function of the introduction time, and the reciprocal degree
	distribution also shows the same power-law due to the linear
	relationship between the reciprocal degree and in/outdegree of nodes. In
	the mesoscale, the distributions of four closed triples representing
	close-knit friendship structures are found to exhibit identical
	power-laws, a behavior attributed to the negligible degree correlations.
	Intriguingly, all the power-law exponents of the distributions in the
	local-scale and mesoscale depend only on one global parameter, the mean
	in/outdegree, while both the mean in/outdegree and the reciprocity
	together determine the ratio of the reciprocal degree of a node to its
	in/outdegree. Structural properties of numerical simulated networks are
	analyzed and compared with each of the four real networks. This work
	helps understand the interplay between structures on different scales in
	online social networks. Citation: Cui A-X, Zhang Z-K, Tang M, Hui PM, Fu

	Month = {SEP 7},
	Abstract = {Background: Human populations are structured by social networks, in
	which individuals tend to form relationships based on shared attributes.
	Certain attributes that are ambiguous, stigmatized or illegal can create
	a OhiddenO population, so-called because its members are difficult to
	identify. Many hidden populations are also at an elevated risk of
	exposure to infectious diseases. Consequently, public health agencies
	are presently adopting modern survey techniques that traverse social
	networks in hidden populations by soliciting individuals to recruit
	their peers, e. g., respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The concomitant
	accumulation of network-based epidemiological data, however, is rapidly
	outpacing the development of computational methods for analysis.
	Moreover, current analytical models rely on unrealistic assumptions, e.
	g., that the traversal of social networks can be modeled by a Markov
	chain rather than a branching process.
	Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we develop a new methodology based
	on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), which are well-suited to
	modeling tree-like structure of the RDS recruitment process. We apply
	this methodology to an RDS case study of injection drug users (IDUs) in
	Tijuana, Mexico, a hidden population at high risk of blood-borne and
	sexually-transmitted infections (i.e., HIV, hepatitis C virus,
	syphilis). Survey data were encoded as text strings that were parsed
	using our custom implementation of the inside-outside algorithm in a
	publicly-available software package (HyPhy), which uses either
	expectation maximization or direct optimization methods and permits
	constraints on model parameters for hypothesis testing. We identified
	significant latent variability in the recruitment process that violates
	assumptions of Markov chain-based methods for RDS analysis: firstly,
	IDUs tended to emulate the recruitment behavior of their own recruiter;
	and secondly, the recruitment of like peers (homophily) was dependent on
	the number of recruits.
	Conclusions: SCFGs provide a rich probabilistic language that can
	articulate complex latent structure in survey data derived from the
	traversal of social networks. Such structure that has no representation
	in Markov chain-based models can interfere with the estimation of the
	composition of hidden populations if left unaccounted for, raising
	critical implications for the prevention and control of infectious
	disease epidemics.},

	recent empirical observations have shown that indirect interactions are

	presence across every region of the world. However, our understanding of
	how foreign capital impacts economic growth in receiving and investing
	countries remains in question, despite nearly five decades of research.
	Our study contributes to this long-standing debate by (1) applying
	social network analysis to the FDI-growth literature, (2) utilizing
	recently available bilateral data for a global sample of countries
	during the post-2000 period, and (3) examining the impact of both inward
	and outward foreign capital on economic growth. While conventional
	measures of FDI typically focus on investment volume, we argue that the
	network structure of investment relations may be equally-or
	more-important. We construct a global network of FDI during the
	2001-2017 period, bringing together two data sets: (1) the United
	Nations Conference on Trade and Development's Bilateral FDI Statistics,
	and (2) the International Monetary Fund's Coordinated Direct Investment
	Survey. We then calculate network centrality scores that reflect each
	country's level of inward and outward embeddedness in the global FDI
	network. Drawing from a sample of 1,467 observations across 137
	countries during the 2001-2017 period, we estimate two-way fixed effects
	models to examine the effect of FDI centrality on economic growth. Net
	of other predictors, we find that inward and outward centrality are
	positively-and independently-associated with growth, while more
	conventional measures of foreign capital display weaker and inconsistent
	effects.},

	Abstract = {Susceptibility to social influence (SSI) has been reported as a key
	factor for social influence in online social networks (OSNs) such as
	Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. In four online studies, we show that
	the personality trait of SSI, namely the susceptibility to normative
	influence (SNI), predicts the extent to which Facebook users comply with
	the behavior of others on Facebook (e.g., buying, voting, or visiting
	what other OSN users post). In Studies 1a and 1b, we find that SSI
	correlates with diverse OSN behaviors, which are the typical results of
	being affected by social influence. In Study 1b, we find that the
	perceived importance of the topic of OSN behaviors (e.g., fashion or
	politics) moderates the effect of SNI on OSN behavior, with a higher
	importance resulting in a stronger effect of SNI on OSN behavior. In
	Studies 2 and 3, we find that SNI predicts the extent Facebook users
	hypothetically ``like{''} diverse topics on Facebook. We also find
	partial support for the idea that there are interactions between SNI and
	the Big Five personality traits (i.e., openness, conscientiousness,
	extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) on OSN behavior.
	Specifically, the extent to which the Big Five personality traits of
	openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism predict OSN behavior depends on
	Facebook users' SNI. Our studies contribute to research on the
	personality-based prediction of OSN behavior and help in better

	strategies have been proved to be efficient using only data and

	benchmark the spreading efficiency of seeding strategies related to

	on empirical and simulated social networks within a wide range of
	densities, clustering coefficients, and sizes. We also propose three new
	decentralized seeding strategies that are structurally different from
	well-known strategies: community hubs, ambassadors, and random hubs. We
	observe that the efficiency ranking of strategies varies with the
	network structure. In general, for sparse networks with community
	structure, decentralized influencers are suitable for increasing the
	spreading efficiency. By contrast, when the networks are denser,
	centralized influencers outperform. These results provide a framework

	Abstract = {In social systems ranging from ant colonies to human society,
	behavioural specialization-consistent individual differences in
	behaviour-is commonplace: individuals can specialize in the tasks they
	perform (division of labour (DOL)), the political behaviour they exhibit
	(political polarization) or the non-task behaviours they exhibit
	(personalities). Across these contexts, behavioural specialization often
	co-occurs with modular and assortative social networks, such that
	individuals tend to associate with others that have the same behavioural
	specialization. This raises the question of whether a common mechanism
	could drive co-emergent behavioural specialization and social network
	structure across contexts. To investigate this question, here we extend
	a model of self-organized DOL to account for social influence and
	interaction bias among individuals-social dynamics that have been shown
	to drive political polarization. We find that these same social dynamics
	can also drive emergent DOL by forming a feedback loop that reinforces
	behavioural differences between individuals, a feedback loop that is
	impacted by group size. Moreover, this feedback loop also results in
	modular and assortative social network structure, whereby individuals
	associate strongly with those performing the same task. Our findings
	suggest that DOL and political polarization-two social phenomena not
	typically considered together-may actually share a common social
	mechanism. This mechanism may result in social organization in many
	contexts beyond task performance and political behaviour.},

	reflects an organizational structure with formal hierarchical
	differentiation among members, then we found triadic transitive closure
	to be associated to boundary spanning across subunits. We test these

	networks that differ from each other in organizational design. We adopt
	a Bayesian approach for exponential random graph models specifically

	Abstract = {Background The structure of a social network as well as peer behaviours
	are thought to affect personal substance use. Where substance use may
	create health risks, understanding the contribution of social networks
	to substance use may be valuable for the design and implementation of
	harm reduction or other interventions. We examined the social support
	network of people living in precarious housing in a socially
	marginalized neighborhood of Vancouver, and analysed associations
	between social network structure, personal substance use, and
	supporters' substance use.
	Methods
	An ongoing, longitudinal study recruited 246 participants from four
	single room occupancy hotels, with 201 providing social network
	information aligned with a 6-month observation period. Use of tobacco,
	alcohol, cannabis, cocaine (crack and powder), methamphetamine, and
	heroin was recorded at monthly visits. Ego- and graph-level measures
	were calculated; the dispersion and prevalence of substances in the
	network was described. Logistic mixed effects models were used to
	estimate the association between ego substance use and peer substance
	use. Permutation analysis was done to test for randomness of substance
	use dispersion on the social network.
	Results
	The network topology corresponded to residence (Hotel) with two clusters
	differing in demographic characteristics (Cluster 1 -Hotel A: 94\% of
	members, Cluster 2 -Hotel B: 95\% of members). Dispersion of substance
	use across the network demonstrated differences according to network
	topology and specific substance. Methamphetamine use (overall 12\%) was
	almost entirely limited to Cluster 1, and absent from Cluster 2.
	Different patterns were observed for other substances. Overall, ego
	substance use did not differ over the six-month period of observation.
	Ego heroin, cannabis, or crack cocaine use was associated with alter use
	of the same substances. Ego methamphetamine, powder cocaine, or alcohol
	use was not associated with alter use, with the exception for
	methamphetamine in a densely using part of the network. For alters using
	multiple substances, cannabis use was associated with lower ego heroin
	use, and lower ego crack cocaine use. Permutation analysis also provided
	evidence that dispersion of substance use, and the association between
	ego and alter use was not random for all substances.
	Conclusions
	In a socially marginalized neighborhood, social network topology was
	strongly influenced by residence, and in turn was associated with
	type(s) of substance use. Associations between personal use and
	supporter's use of a substance differed across substances. These complex
	associations may merit consideration in the design of interventions to
	reduce risk and harms associated with substance use in people living in
	precarious housing.},

	Month = {JUN 27},
	Abstract = {Modeling human behavioral data is challenging due to its scale,
	sparseness (few observations per individual), heterogeneity (differently
	behaving individuals), and class imbalance (few observations of the
	outcome of interest). An additional challenge is learning an
	interpretable model that not only accurately predicts outcomes, but also
	identifies important factors associated with a given behavior. To
	address these challenges, we describe a statistical approach to modeling
	behavioral data called the structured sum-of-squares decomposition
	(S3D). The algorithm, which is inspired by decision trees, selects
	important features that collectively explain the variation of the
	outcome, quantifies correlations between the features, and bins the
	subspace of important features into smaller, more homogeneous blocks
	that correspond to similarly-behaving subgroups within the population.
	This partitioned subspace allows us to predict and analyze the behavior
	of the outcome variable both statistically and visually, giving a medium
	to examine the effect of various features and to create explainable
	predictions. We apply S3D to learn models of online activity from
	large-scale data collected from diverse sites, such as Stack Exchange,
	Khan Academy, Twitter, Duolingo, and Digg. We show that S3D creates
	parsimonious models that can predict outcomes in the held-out data at
	levels comparable to state-of-the-art approaches, but in addition,
	produces interpretable models that provide insights into behaviors. This
	is important for informing strategies aimed at changing behavior,
	designing social systems, but also for explaining predictions, a
	critical step towards minimizing algorithmic bias.},

	Abstract = {By using Social Network Analysis (SNA), this study empirically analyzes
	five PKK Affiliated narco-terror and five illicit drug networks in the
	Turkish context to identify and compare their approach to the
	security-efficiency tradeoff. Results revealed that although terrorist
	members are in key roles and powerful positions (central and
	intermediary), average scores of cohesion and centrality of narco-terror
	networks seem to be only slightly more security driven than those of
	illicit drug networks. However, analyses of individual networks from
	both types yield no clear structural distinction in prioritizing between
	security and efficiency. This study, in general, finds that networks
	from both camps are structurally more efficiency driven. They are denser
	with more direct ties; generally clustered into sub-groups attached to
	networks' cores and peripheries; they reflect coreness, where key
	players act in pivotal positions with high power, centrality, and
	brokerage to efficiently control and coordinate network activities. This
	is then found to cause security vulnerabilities of greater visibility
	(susceptibility of disruption) and high dependence on central actors
	constituting structural holes (possible elimination of entire network
	when compromised). However, sample networks strive to balance the
	security by keeping the paths-for the flow of information-shorter and
	being clustered into denser sub-groups with strong pre-existing
	trust-ties (kinship and friendship) which reduces the risk of detection
	and infiltration. This study argues that the nature of objective
	dominates the structural characteristics regarding the
	security-efficiency dilemma, and thus, both illicit drug and PKK
	affiliated narco-terror networks in Turkish context are driven by
	material incentives relying more on efficiency and striving to balance
	organizational security with social characteristics (trust ties).},

	approach to investigate a longstanding puzzle about why some of those
	who leave military service for civilian life fare well, and others
	badly. In a mixed-methods analysis, I follow a sample of individuals
	moving through the transition from military to civilian life in the

	alters (i.e., ``contacts{''}) with a military background in the networks
	of leavers before discharge, the worse they fare after discharge. The
	CMN approach helps me locate a specific structural embedding that
	explains the presence or absence of durable cultural frames that set the
	context for the actual experience of the transition and cause problems
	during it. Attention to the temporal unfolding of network structure and
	social meaning is essential to bringing out this finding. By
	re-embedding networks within people's experiences over time, the CMN
	approach helps grasp the distinctions by which leavers understand their

	Abstract = {Since the SARS crisis in 2003, institutionalized emergency management
	systems have been established in each government level for improving
	inter-organizational collaboration in China. Major accidents require
	participation of public organizations affiliated with multiple
	government levels, and the lack of collaboration and coordination among
	the involved organizations within the critical time constraints during
	the response process is an existing problem. In this research, a case
	study of examining the intergovernmental and cross-sectoral
	collaboration for responding to a well-known oil pipeline explosion
	accident in China by a complex network method is conducted. The aim is
	to obtain managerial insights in improving the existing emergency
	management system in a centralized political-administrative context,
	such as China. A mixed method of data collection is applied to identify
	the participating organizations and to determine the interaction
	spanning organizational boundaries in both hierarchical and horizontal
	dimensions. An emergency response network is built and visualized for
	representing intergovernmental and interorganizational collaboration
	during the response process of the major accident by social network
	analysis (SNA) tools. The SNA indicators are used to measure
	quantitatively the network structure at the levels of the whole network,
	subnetwork, and node. The obstacles of achieving intergovernmental
	collaboration are found, and managerial suggestions for improving the
	existing emergency management system are provided. This research
	indicates that the Chinese government should pay attention to
	establishing and sustaining partnerships with private and nonprofit
	organizations and conduct a blend of hierarchical, market, and network
	principles in fostering collaboration for addressing major accidents.
	The public organizations in the local government level are shown to be
	more active than other participators in coordinating their response
	operations, and their capability should be emphasized for improvement.
	Additionally, the interactive relationships among specific emergency
	function groups and between the affected communities and organizations
	performing emergency command and coordination function should be
	strengthened.},

	Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs) suggest that status is a consequence of
	network ties because over time the level of status attributed to
	individual students by other students tends to the average level of
	status attributed to their network partners-a phenomenon we call status
	assimilation. Status is also an antecedent to network ties because it
	affects partner selection decisions, giving rise to distinct forms of
	social attachment. We find that both network-based processes of status
	assimilation, as well as status-based processes of social selection, are
	present, but they vary subtly yet significantly across network domains.
	Students tend to the average level of status of their friends, but not
	to that of their advisors. High-status students are more active in the
	friendship network, but more popular in the advice network. We find
	evidence of performance homophily rather than status homophily: students
	with similar grades are more likely to exchange friendship and advice
	ties. High-status students tend to be more central in the advice
	network, but status attributions spill over through friendship, rather
	than advice relations. The study documents how the relation between
	social status and social networks varies both over time, as well as
	across network domains. The study also demonstrates the importance of
	accounting for multiplexity-the tendency of a network to operate through

	Abstract = {Network science is an interdisciplinary field which provides an

	drawing attention to the importance of network characterization, which
	may lead to understanding the topological properties that are related to
	the network model. In this paper, the Life-Like Network Automata (LLNA)
	method is introduced, which was designed for pattern recognition in
	networks. LLNA uses the network topology as a tessellation of Cellular
	Automata (CA), whose dynamics produces a spatio-temporal pattern used to
	extract the feature vector for network characterization. The method was
	evaluated using synthetic and real-world networks. In the latter, three
	pattern recognition applications were used: (i) identifying organisms
	from distinct domains of life through their metabolic networks, (ii)
	identifying online social networks and (iii) classifying stomata
	distribution patterns varying according to different lighting
	conditions. LLNA was compared to structural measurements and surpasses
	them in real-world applications, achieving improvement in the
	classification rate as high as 23\%, 4\% and 7\% respectively.

	Abstract = {Objectives: Online Cessation Support Networks (OCSNs) are associated
	with increased quit success rates, but few studies have examined their
	use over time. We identified usage patterns in New Zealand's largest
	OCSN over two years and explored implications for OCSN intervention
	design and evaluation.
	Methods: We analysed metadata relating to 133,096 OCSN interactions
	during 2011 and 2012. Metrics covered aggregate network activity, user
	posting activity and longevity, and between-user commenting. Binary
	logistic regression models were estimated to investigate the feasibility
	of predicting low user engagement using early interaction data.
	Results: Repeating periodic peaks and troughs in aggregate activity
	related not only to seasonality (e.g., New Year), but also to day of the
	week. Out of 2,062 unique users, 69 Highly Engaged Users (180+
	interactions each) contributed 69\% of all OCSN interactions in 2012
	compared to 1.3\% contributed by 864 Minimally Engaged Users (< = 2
	items each). The proportion of Highly Engaged Users increased with
	network growth between 2011 and 2012 (with marginal significance), but
	the proportion of Minimally Engaged Users did not decline substantively.
	First week interaction data enabled identification of Minimally Engaged
	Users with high specificity and sensitivity (AUROC = 0.94).
	Implications: Results suggest future research should develop and test
	interventions that promote activity, and hence cessation support,
	amongst specific user groups or at key time points. For example, early
	usage information could help identify Minimally Engaged Users for tests
	of targeted messaging designed to improve their integration into, or
	re-engagement with, the OCSN. Furthermore, although we observed strong
	growth over time on varied metrics including posts and comments, this
	change did not coincide with large gains in first-time user persistence.

	motives, but in essence they are not created for the purposes of

	portray and reframe content of alternative views. This represents
	homophily in the guise of cross-linking.},

	Abstract = {Social networking services (e. g., Twitter, Facebook) are now major
	sources of World Wide Web (called ``Web{''}) dynamics, together with Web
	search services (e. g., Google). These two types of Web services
	mutually influence each other but generate different dynamics. In this
	paper, we distinguish two modes of Web dynamics: the reactive mode and
	the default mode. It is assumed that Twitter messages (called
	``tweets{''}) and Google search queries react to significant social
	movements and events, but they also demonstrate signs of becoming
	self-activated, thereby forming a baseline Web activity. We define the
	former as the reactive mode and the latter as the default mode of the
	Web. In this paper, we investigate these reactive and default modes of
	the Web's dynamics using transfer entropy (TE). The amount of
	information transferred between a time series of 1,000 frequent keywords
	in Twitter and the same keywords in Google queries is investigated
	across an 11-month time period. Study of the information flow on Google
	and Twitter revealed that information is generally transferred from
	Twitter to Google, indicating that Twitter time series have some
	preceding information about Google time series. We also studied the
	information flow among different Twitter keywords time series by taking
	keywords as nodes and flow directions as edges of a network. An analysis
	of this network revealed that frequent keywords tend to become an
	information source and infrequent keywords tend to become sink for other
	keywords. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that frequent keywords
	form the Web's default mode, which becomes an information source for
	infrequent keywords that generally form the Web's reactive mode. We also
	found that the Web consists of different time resolutions with respect
	to TE among Twitter keywords, which will be another focal point of this
	paper.},

	Abstract = {Models of infectious disease spread that incorporate contact
	heterogeneity through contact networks are an important tool for
	epidemiologists studying disease dynamics and assessing intervention
	strategies. One of the challenges of contact network epidemiology has
	been the difficulty of collecting individual and population-level data
	needed to develop an accurate representation of the underlying host
	population's contact structure. In this study, we evaluate the utility
	of common epidemiological measures (R-0, epidemic peak size, duration
	and final size) for inferring the degree of heterogeneity in a
	population's unobserved contact structure through a Bayesian approach.
	We test the method using ground truth data and find that some of these
	epidemiological metrics are effective at classifying contact
	heterogeneity. The classification is also consistent across pathogen
	transmission probabilities, and so can be applied even when this
	characteristic is unknown. In particular, the reproductive number, R-0,
	turns out to be a poor classifier of the degree heterogeneity, while,
	unexpectedly, final epidemic size is a powerful predictor of network
	structure across the range of heterogeneity. We also evaluate our
	framework on empirical epidemiological data from past and recent
	outbreaks to demonstrate its application in practice and to gather
	insights about the relevance of particular contact structures for both
	specific systems and general classes of infectious disease. We thus
	introduce a simple approach that can shed light on the unobserved
	connectivity of a host population given epidemic data. Our study has the
	potential to inform future data-collection efforts and study design by
	driving our understanding of germane epidemic measures, and highlights a
	general inferential approach to learning about host contact structure in
	contemporary or historic populations of humans and animals.},

	The research team used semi-structured interviews and network analysis

	Turkish residents described their neighborhood environment and to grasp
	the everyday social relations they maintained. Three major results are
	reported: a) Ethno-national groups and identities do not represent the
	most important principles of classification in the eyes of local
	residents. Rather, the social world is described in terms of a basic
	scheme distinguishing between order and disorder. b) From this, a
	transethnic definition of the its-group results, which does not,
	however, entirely conform to actually observed networking behavior:
	three quarters of the social networks were mono-ethnic in their
	composition. c) In the second generation, the structures of these
	networks show no differences between the three ethno-national groups.
	The results conform in part to the multicultural theory of ethnic
	community formation (b), in part to its competitor, the theory of
	ethnicization (or racialization) of immigrant societies (a and c). As a

	Abstract = {-In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, people spread various
	COVID-19-related rumors and hoaxes that negatively influence human
	civilization through online social networks (OSN). The proposed research
	addresses the unique and innovative approach to controlling COVID-19
	rumors through the power of opinion leaders (OLs) in OSN. The entire
	process is partitioned into two phases; the first phase describes the
	novel Reputation-based Opinion Leader Identification (ROLI) algorithm,
	including a unique voting method to identify the top-T OLs in the OSN.
	The second phase describes the technique to measure the aggregated
	polarity score of each posted tweet/post and compute each user's
	reputation. The empirical reputation is utilized to calculate the user's
	trust, the post's entropy, and its veracity. If the experimental entropy
	of the post is lower than the empirical threshold value, the post is
	likely to be categorized as a rumor. The proposed approach operated on
	Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit social networks for validation. The ROLI
	algorithm provides 91\% accuracy, 93\% precision, 95\% recall, and 94\%
	F1-score over other Social Network Analysis (SNA) measures to find OLs
	in OSN. Moreover, the proposed approach's rumor controlling
	effectiveness and efficiency is also estimated based on three standard
	metrics; affected degree, represser degree, and diffuser degree, and
	obtained 26\%, 22\%, and 23\% improvement, respectively. The concluding
	outcomes illustrate that the influence of OLs is exceptionally
	significant in controlling COVID-19 rumors.},

	Specifically, we ask: How is firms' Twitter discussion developing during

	To what extent do they resonate with the public? We downloaded Twitter
	posts by the accounts of large Italian firms, and we built the bipartite

	benchmark, we projected the information contained in the network into
	the accounts layers, identifying a network of accounts. We find that the
	network is composed of 13 communities and accounts at the core of the
	network focus on environmental sustainability, digital innovation, and
	safety. Firms' ownership type does not seem to influence the

	visiting Malaysian oil palm plantations in search of food despite
	elevated predation risk. Specifically, we found critical reductions of
	key positive social interactions but higher rates of aggression in the

	areas bordering the forest) and the forest. At the plantation edge,
	affiliation even increased compared to the forest, while central
	positions in the macaques' social network structure shifted from
	high-ranking adult females and immatures to low-ranking individuals.
	Further, plantations also affected mother-infant relationships, with
	macaque mothers being more protective in the open plantation
	environment. We suggest that although primates can temporarily persist
	in human-altered habitats, their ability to permanently adapt requires
	the presence of close-by forest and comes with a trade-off in sociality,

	the contribution of social capital derived from network homophily, that

	Our results show that differences in network structure explain as much
	as 15\% of the overall gender wage gap. This finding is largely driven
	by gender differences in the number of males among closest friends,
	while other social capital measures used in this study hardly matter. We
	further show that differences in returns to social capital are not

	Abstract = {Modern cities form city networks through complex social ties. City
	network research is widely applied to guide regional planning,
	infrastructure construction, and resource allocation. China put forward
	the Yellow River Basin Development Strategy in 2019, but no research has
	been conducted on regional social connections among cities. Based on the
	gravity model modified by two-way ``time distance{''} between cities,
	this is the first study to empirically examine the intensity and
	structure of the entire city network in the Yellow River basin using the
	social network analysis method and ArcGIS software. The connection rules
	of the cross-city transfer of city officials in the basin are also
	investigated to illustrate the official ties between cities. The results
	suggest that the intensity of two-way connections between cities is
	generally low in the Yellow River basin and there is a positive
	correlation between city network development level and regional economic
	development level. The development gap between cities on the north and
	south banks is larger than that between the east and west regions, and
	some cities in the middle and upper reaches of the river are
	marginalized in the network. The status of the central cities in the
	Yellow River basin is distinct, but their connecting and leading
	abilities are not strong, showing an inverted T-shaped spatial
	distribution. The subgroups of city networks have strong internal
	connections, while the connection among subgroups is weak and the
	development shows a partitioned and fragmented pattern, making it
	difficult to form linkages among the upper, middle, and lower reaches.
	The ``beaded chain{''} spatial development strategy can be adopted in
	the river basin planning, giving priority to strengthening the links
	within subgroups of cities and among adjacent subgroups, building
	central city chains, and reinforcing the overall basin management.},

	Abstract = {Breastfeeding is one of many health practices known to support the
	survival and health of mother and infant, yet low breastfeeding rates
	persist globally. These rates may be influenced by limited diffusion of
	evidence-based research and guidelines from the scientific community
	(SC). As recently highlighted by the National Academy of Sciences, there
	is a need for the SC to diffuse its findings to the public more
	effectively online, as means to counteract the spread of misinformation.
	In response to this call, we gathered data from Twitter for one month
	from major breastfeeding hashtags resulting in an interconnected social
	network (n= 3,798 users). We then identified 59 influencers who
	disproportionately influenced information flow using social network
	analysis. These influencers were from the SC (e.g. academics,
	researchers, health care practitioners), as well as interested citizens
	(IC) and companies. We then conducted an ego-network analysis of
	influencer networks, developed ego maps, and compared diffusion metrics
	across the SC, IC and company influencers. We also qualitatively
	analyzed their tweets (n = 711) to understand the type of information
	being diffused. SC influencers were the least efficient communicators.
	Although having the highest tweeting activity (80\% of tweets), they did
	not reach more individuals compared to IC and companies (two-step ego
	size: 220 +/- 99, 188 +/- 124, 169 +/- 97 respectively,P= 0.28). Content
	analysis of tweets suggest IC are more active than the SC in diffusing
	evidence-based breastfeeding knowledge, with 35\% of their tweets around
	recent research findings compared to only 12\% by the SC. Nonetheless,
	in terms of outreach to the general public, the two-step networks of SC
	influences were more heterogenous than ICs (55.7 +/- 5.07, 50.9 +/-
	12.0, respectively,P<0.001). Collectively, these findings suggest SC
	influencers may possess latent potential to diffuse research and
	evidence- based practices. However, the research suggests specific ways
	to enhance diffusion.},

	Abstract = {Rationale/background Though much smaller than the bovine industry, the
	porcine sector in Argentina involves a large number of farms and
	represents a significant economic sector. In recent years Argentina has
	implemented a national registry of swine movements amongst other
	measures, in an effort to control and eventually eradicate endemic
	Aujesky's disease. Such information can prove valuable in assessing the
	risk of transmission between farms for endemic diseases but also for
	other diseases at risk of emergence. Methods Shipment data from 2011 to
	2016 were analyzed in an effort to define strategic locations and times
	at which control and surveillance efforts should be focused to provide
	cost-effective interventions. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to
	characterize the network as a whole and at the individual farm and
	market level to help identify important nodes. Spatio-temporal trends of
	pig movements were also analyzed. Finally, in an attempt to classify
	farms and markets in different groups based on their SNA metrics, we
	used factor analysis for mixed data (FAMD) and hierarchical clustering.
	Results The network involved approximate 136,000 shipments for a total
	of 6 million pigs. Over 350 markets and 17,800 production units
	participated in shipments with another 83,500 not participating.
	Temporal data of shipments and network metrics showed peaks in shipments
	in September and October. Most shipments where within provinces, with
	Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe concentrating 61\% of shipments.
	Network analysis showed that markets are involved in relatively few
	shipments but hold strategic positions with much higher betweenness
	compared to farms. Hierarchical clustering yielded four groups based on
	SNA metrics and node characteristics which can be broadly described as:
	1. small and backyard farms; 2. industrial farms; 3. markets; and 4. a
	single outlying market with extreme centrality values. Conclusion
	Characterizing the network structure and spatio-temporal characteristics
	of Argentine swine shipments provides valuable information that can
	guide targeted and more cost-effective surveillance and control
	programs. We located key nodes where efforts should be prioritized. Pig
	network characteristics and patterns can be used to create dynamic
	disease transmission models, which can both be used in assessing the
	impact of emerging diseases and guiding efforts to eradicate endemic

	Month = {OCT 17},
	Abstract = {Recent transitions in the governance of urban stormwater, specifically
	developments that leverage the environmental and social benefits of
	green infrastructure (GI) including infiltration and neighborhood
	stabilization, often require capacities beyond those of any single
	municipal- or regional-scale organization. In many cities, transitions
	toward green storm water infrastructure have been shepherded by networks
	of individuals spanning a diversity of organizations from governments to
	NGOs. These networks are often informal, that is, not established by
	legal mandate, governing authority, or formal agreement, and are often
	striking for their lack of formal hierarchy or formal leadership.
	Previous scholarship has revealed the importance of leadership in the
	development and efficacy of these multiorganizational, cross-sector
	environmental governance networks, but research has yet to empirically
	investigate and characterize informal network leaders within the context
	of GI for stormwater mitigation. To address this gap, we designed and
	administered a social network analysis (SNA) survey to individuals in a
	regional network of GI stormwater management professionals in and around
	Cleveland, Ohio USA. We collected network data on individual
	relationships, including collaboration and trust, and tested the impact
	of these relationships on peer-recognition of leaders in the GI network.
	Our findings suggest that network size, frequency of collaboration, and
	individual position within the network specifically, betweenness
	centrality and openness defined and likely supported leaders in the
	stormwater governance network. Leaders in this non-hierarchical,
	multi-institution context were more likely to be women and brokerage
	roles within the network benefitted women, not men, which contrasts with
	previous findings from research on single-organization and corporate
	networks. The implications of this research suggest that informal
	environmental governance networks, such as the GI network investigated,
	differ substantially from the generally more hierarchical networks of
	organizations. This finding is useful for municipalities and regional
	authorities grappling with complex environmental challenges, including
	transitions in strategies to manage excess stormwater for the protection
	of municipal drinking water sources and urban freshwater ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {Background
	As population health and well-being are influenced by multiple factors
	that cut across sectoral boundaries, an intersectoral approach that
	acknowledges and leverages the multiple determinants, actors and sectors
	at play is increasingly seen as critical for achieving meaningful and
	lasting improvements. In this study, we utilize social network analysis
	(SNA) to characterize the intersectoral collaboration between the
	organizations working on maternal \& child health (MCH) and water \&
	sanitation (WASH) before and immediately after the implementation of HCL
	Foundation (HCLF)-funded HCL Samuday Project (2015-2017) in a rural
	block of Uttar Pradesh state, India. While SNA has been used to examine
	public health issues, few have used it monitor stakeholder
	relationships, intervene, improve and facilitate project implementation
	involving intersectoral partnerships, particularly in the context of a
	low-and middle-income countries.
	Method
	An organization-level SNA was conducted with 31 key informants from 24
	organizations working on MCH and/or WASH in Kachhauna, Uttar Pradesh,
	India. Data were collected using face-to-face, semi-structured
	interviews between June and September 2017. Density, centrality and
	homophily were calculated to describe the network and a qualitative
	analysis was also conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of
	collaboration between organizations working on MCH and WASH.
	Results
	Overall, our findings showed that the network of organizations working
	on MCH and WASH in Kachhauna grew in number since the implementation of
	Samuday. HCLF rapidly achieved centrality, thus positioning the
	organization to serve as a gatekeeper of information and enabling it to
	play a coordinator role within the network. Direct collaboration between
	other organizations working on MCH and WASH was low at both time points.
	Interviews with key informants indicated widespread interest in
	increasing interorganizational interactions and engagement throughout
	the network.
	Conclusion
	This study demonstrates the feasibility and practical application of SNA
	for projects like Samuday that involve intersectoral collaboration. It
	also provides lessons about the use of SNA with organizations as the
	unit of analysis and in the context of rural India, including
	challenges, practical considerations, and limitations.},

	Abstract = {Many contemporary violence prevention programs direct concentrated law
	enforcement, social service, or educational attention toward individuals
	engaged in violence, and yet, this population is often avoiding this
	precise attention. Drawing on 18 months of ethnographic data, this case
	study asks: How do street outreach workers form social ties with active
	gang members? This study identifies three key mechanisms of social tie
	formation that break organizational rules, but account for how new
	social relations are formed with street savvy gang youth: (1) Network
	Targeting: identifying, entering, and extending services to the package
	of preexisting social ties beyond the eligible gang member; (2) Gift
	Giving: navigating those social ties when transferring out of pocket
	gifts to the target to elicit trust and demonstrate genuine investment;
	and (3) Transportation Brokerage: expanding clients' social networks by
	literally driving them to prosocial influences and activities.
	Discussion of the value and limitations of each mechanism offers
	insights to urban sociologists interested in the origins of social ties
	in disadvantaged communities, as well as policymakers designing social
	interventions for hard to reach populations.},

	environments that protect their cognitive resources, such that they
	exhibit greater creativity when the work environment is free from

	Abstract = {The overwhelming success of online social networks, the key actors in
	the Web 2.0 cosmos, has reshaped human interactions globally. To help
	understand the fundamental mechanisms which determine the fate of online
	social networks at the system level, we describe the digital world as a

	impact of heterogeneity in network fitnesses on the competition between
	an international network, such as Facebook, and local services. The
	higher fitness of international networks is induced by their ability to
	attract users from all over the world, which can then establish social
	interactions without the limitations of local networks. In other words,
	inter-country social ties lead to increased fitness of the international
	network. To study the competition between an international network and
	local ones, we construct a 1: 1000 scale model of the digital world,
	consisting of the 80 countries with the most Internet users. Under

	In this paper, we propose a theoretical model based upon previous

	We provide empirical support for this model using real-world data within
	the context of the Australian radiology profession. An examination of
	radiologists' professional network topology through
	structural-positional and relational dimensions and radiologists'
	personal characteristics in terms of knowledge, experience and
	self-esteem is provided. Thirty one breast imaging radiologists
	completed a purpose designed questionnaire regarding their network
	characteristics and personal attributes. These radiologists also
	independently read a test set of 60 mammographic cases: 20 cases with
	cancer and 40 normal cases. A Jackknife free response operating
	characteristic (JAFROC) method was used to measure the performance of
	the radiologists' in detecting breast cancers.
	Results
	Correlational analyses showed that reader performance was positively
	correlated with the social network variables of degree centrality and
	effective size, but negatively correlated with constraint and hierarchy.
	For personal characteristics, the number of mammograms read per year and
	self-esteem (self-evaluation) positively correlated with reader
	performance. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that
	the combination of number of mammograms read per year and network's
	effective size, hierarchy and tie strength was the best fitting model,
	explaining 63.4\% of the variance in reader performance. The results
	from this study indicate the positive relationship between reading high
	volumes of cases by radiologists and expertise development, but also
	strongly emphasise the association between effective social/professional
	interactions and informal knowledge sharing with high performance.},

	Abstract = {Objective: The aim of the present study was to examine to what extent
	different social network mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of
	obesity and insulin-resistance.
	Design: We used nonparametric and parametric regression models to
	analyse whether individual BMI and HOMA-IR are determined by social
	network characteristics.
	Subjects and Methods: A total of 677 probands (EGO) and 3033 social
	network partners (ALTER) were included in the study. Data gathered from
	the probands include anthropometric measures, HOMA-IR index, health
	attitudes, behavioural and socio- economic variables and social network
	data.
	Results: We found significant treatment effects for ALTERs frequent
	dieting (p < 0.001) and ALTERs health oriented nutritional attitudes (p,
	0.001) on EGO's BMI, establishing a significant indirect network effect
	also on EGO's insulin resistance. Most importantly, we also found
	significant direct social network effects on EGO's insulin resistance,
	evidenced by an effect of ALTERs frequent dieting (p = 0.033) and ALTERs
	sport activities (p = 0.041) to decrease EGO's HOMA-IR index
	independently of EGO's BMI.
	Conclusions: Social network phenomena appear not only to be relevant for
	the spread of obesity, but also for the spread of insulin resistance as
	the basis for type 2 diabetes. Attitudes and behaviour of peer groups
	influence EGO's health status not only via social mechanisms, but also
	via socio- biological mechanisms, i.e. higher brain areas might be
	influenced not only by biological signals from the own organism, but
	also by behaviour and knowledge from different human individuals. Our
	approach allows the identification of peer group influence controlling
	for potential homophily even when using cross-sectional observational
	data.},

	comparative analysis over time of the network of corporate-state

	very frequent in 1969 are in decline, reflecting and confirming a rapid
	disentanglement of the corporate sector from what was until the 1980s an
	example of neo-corporatist socio-economic arrangement. The disappearance
	of industrial policy, privatization of state-owned corporations, the
	emergence of autonomous administrative units, and the `hollowing out' of
	the state, all contribute to the fading of the state. The network
	structure that remains in place - albeit thin - is not dominated by
	either the state or business but rather a partnership between separate

	and quasi-anonymous transmission in shooting galleries. Results confirm
	the importance of network structure and actor heterogeneity to the
	magnitude and speed of HIV transmission. Models further demonstrate that
	quasi-anonymous injections in shooting galleries increase the speed of
	HIV diffusion across the whole network and have the greatest impact on
	HIV seroconversion levels for IDUs at the network periphery. Shooting
	galleries are shown to be transmission hubs that operate independently
	of traceable structural ties, linking otherwise unconnected network
	components. CABMs potentially increase understandings of HIV diffusion
	dynamics by infusing computer simulations with empirical data. (C) 2011

	Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for humanity to reach by 2030.
	Society is involved in the challenge, with firms playing a crucial role.
	Thus, a key question is to what extent firms engage with the SDGs.
	Efforts to map firms' contributions have mainly focused on analysing
	companies' reports based on limited samples and non-real-time data. We
	present a novel interdisciplinary approach based on analysing big data
	from an online social network (Twitter) with complex network methods
	from statistical physics. By doing so, we provide a comprehensive and
	nearly real-time picture of firms' engagement with SDGs. Results show
	that: (1) SDGs themes tie conversations among major UK firms together;
	(2) the social dimension is predominant; (3) the attention to different
	SDGs themes varies depending on the community and sector firms belong
	to; (4) stakeholder engagement is higher on posts related to global
	challenges compared to general ones; (5) large UK companies and
	stakeholders generally behave differently from Italian ones. This paper
	provides theoretical contributions and practical implications relevant
	to firms, policymakers and management education. Most importantly, it
	provides a novel tool and a set of keywords to monitor the influence of
	the private sector on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.},

	Abstract = {Despite longstanding discussions and consequent improvements of gender
	representation in academia, the number of women working in academic
	research, their performance and their recognition still indicate the
	persistence of gender inequalities. Of the various mechanisms that may
	drive such inequality the one that relates the structure of research
	collaborative networks to the rewards that these networks facilitate is
	intriguing. If social networks play a role in academic performances and
	women are under-recognized compared to men, what are the mechanisms that
	relate networks to gender inequalities in academia? Do men and women
	obtain equal returns from similar network structure, or do women have to
	build different networks to obtain similar returns?
	This article contributes to the theoretical debate that aims to
	disentangle the mechanisms by which social networks may affect gendered
	success. We do so by looking at networks of collaborations to research
	projects in 10 years of public funding in Italy. We use a permutation
	t-test analysis to see if men and women, who are equally successful in
	getting funded for a high number of projects, build equal or unequal
	collaborative networks, and if these differences vary across disciplines
	with more or less tenured women. Our methodological contribution
	proposes an innovative way of measuring brokerage and constraint in one
	mode projections of bipartite networks, highly clustered and valued, and
	measures gender homophily by taking into account the higher or lower
	number of women available for collaborations in different disciplinary
	sectors. We find that men and women build similar collaborative
	networks; we also find that the more women are tenured in a discipline,
	the more they occupy higher ranks and lead research projects. When
	women's presence and high-rank roles increase, we see that men's
	collaborative networks are significantly more heterophilous, although
	women do not seem to significantly increase their collaborations with
	other women.
	We then regress the individual measures of network structure and
	composition against the average amount of money scholars receive per
	project and we interact each measure with gender, to observe if women
	obtain similar returns to men by building equal collaborative networks.
	Our results show that despite the similarities in network configurations
	in nearly all disciplines women still receive less funding than men.
	This suggests that an increased representation of women in academic
	fields is not enough to reduce inequalities. Our results are not
	directly generalizable to other international contexts, but the
	mechanisms that favor academic returns and exacerbate inequalities, and
	our methodological approach, are portable to other scientific and
	organizational contexts where collaborations are key to produce success.},

	Abstract = {Study question While physician relationships (measured through shared
	patients) are associated with clinical and utilization outcomes, the
	extent to which this is driven by local or global network
	characteristics is not well established. The objective of this research
	is to examine the association between local and global network
	statistics with total medical spending and utilization. Data source Data
	used are the 2011 Massachusetts All Payer Claims Database. Study design
	The association between network statistics and total medical spending
	and utilization (using standardized prices) is estimated using
	multivariate regression analysis controlling for patient demographics
	and health status. Data collection We limit the sample to continuously
	enrolled commercially insured patients in Massachusetts in 2011.
	Principal findings Mean patient age was 45 years, and 56.3\% of patients
	were female. 73.4\% were covered by a health maintenance organization.
	Average number of visits was 5.43, with average total medical spending
	of \$4,911 and total medical utilization of \$4,252. Spending was lower
	for patients treated by physicians with higher degree (p<0.001),
	eigenvector centrality (p<0.001), clustering coefficient (p<0.001), and
	measures reflecting the normalized degree (p<0.001) and eigenvector
	centrality (p<0.001) of specialists connected to a patient's PCP.
	Spending was higher for patients treated by physicians with higher
	normalized degree, which accounts for physician specialty and patient
	panel size (p<0.001). Results were similar for utilization outcomes,
	although magnitudes differed indicating patients may see different
	priced physicians. Conclusions Generally, higher values of network
	statistics reflecting local connectivity adjusted for physician
	characteristics are associated with increased costs and utilization,
	while higher values of network statistics reflecting global connectivity
	are associated with decreased costs and utilization. As changes in the
	financing and delivery system advance through policy changes and
	healthcare consolidation, future research should examine mechanisms
	through which this structure impacts outcomes and potential policy
	responses to determine ways to reduce costs while maintaining quality
	and coordination of care. What this study adds It is unknown whether
	local and global measures of physician network connectivity associated
	with spending and utilization for commercially insured patients? In this
	social network analysis, we found generally higher values of network
	statistics reflecting local connectivity are associated with increased
	costs and utilization, while higher values of network statistics
	reflecting global connectivity are associated with decreased costs and
	utilization. Understanding how to influence local and global physician

	and peripheral aspects that grant it bonding and bridging qualities;
	(iii) weak ties in social capital networks are more beneficial for
	acquiring non-redundant resources, and for joining civic/voluntary

	valuable resources, these ties are rarely transformed into social

	Abstract = {Friendship formation is of central importance to online social network
	sites and to society, but can suffer from significant and unequal
	frictions. In this study, we demonstrate that social networks and policy
	makers may use an IT-facilitated intervention - displaying things in
	common (TIC) between users (mutual hometown, interest, education, work,
	city) - to encourage friendship formation, especially among people who
	are different from each other. Displaying TIC may update an individual's
	belief about the shared similarity with another and reduce information
	friction that may be hard to overcome in offline communication. In
	collaboration with an online social network, we design and implement a
	randomized field experiment, which randomly varies the prominence of
	different types of things in common information when a user (viewer) is
	browsing a non-friend's profile. The dyad-level exogenous variation,
	orthogonal to any (un)observed structural factors in viewer-profile's
	network, allows us to cleanly isolate the role of individuals'
	preference for TIC in driving network formation and homophily. We find
	that displaying TIC to viewers may significantly increase their
	probability of sending a friend request and forming a friendship, and is
	especially effective for pairs of people who have little in common. Such
	findings suggest that information intervention is a very effective and
	zero-cost approach to encourage the formation of weak ties, and also
	provide the first experimental evidence on the crucial role of
	individuals' preference (versus structural embeddedness) in network
	formation. We further demonstrate that displaying TIC could improve
	friendship formation for a wide range of viewers with different
	demographics and friendship status, and is more effective when the TIC
	information is more surprising to the viewer. Our study offers
	actionable insights to social networks and policy makers on the design
	of information intervention to encourage friendship formation and

	This is especially true in the case of tobacco use, where smokers have

	the negative health effects of smoking, in some cases leading smokers to
	increase their prosmoking bias. Here, we extend recent work on
	`networked collective intelligence' by testing the hypothesis that
	allowing smokers and nonsmokers to collaboratively evaluate anti-smoking
	advertisements in online social networks can improve their ability to
	accurately assess the negative health effects of tobacco use. Using
	Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we conducted an online experiment where

	advertisements and asked to estimate the negative health effects of
	tobacco use, either on their own or in the presence of peer influence in
	a social network. Contrary to popular predictions, we find that both
	smokers and nonsmokers were surprisingly inaccurate at interpreting
	anti-smoking messages, and their errors persisted if they continued to
	interpret these messages on their own. However, smokers and nonsmokers
	significantly improved in their ability to accurately interpret
	anti-smoking messages by sharing their opinions in structured online
	social networks. Specifically, subjects in social networks reduced the
	error of their risk estimates by over 10 times more than subjects who
	revised solely based on individual reflection (p < 0.001, 10
	experimental trials in total). These results suggest that social media

	Abstract = {This paper aims to model multilevel interdependencies in complex
	organisational systems and proposes application for resilience analysis.
	Most of the existing research studied interdependencies only at the
	single-level and overlooked their multilevel character. In response to
	this gap, we propose a multilevel approach to better comprehend the
	complexity of interdependencies in organisational systems. More
	specifically, the study focuses on how interdependencies are shaped
	across multiple organisational levels. To understand the research
	problem, we use multilevel and social network theories to elaborate the
	concept at five organisational levels, namely, individual, intraunit,
	interunit, intraorganisational, and interorganisational. Further, we
	show the application of multilevel interdependencies into analysis of
	organisational resilience. To this end, we construct a multiplex model
	of a real world organisational system that comprises formal and informal
	relations of different social exchange strength. Using the agent-based
	simulations of the organisational system, we investigate the relations
	between organisational interdependencies and organisational performance
	in normal and disrupted conditions. With the results, we argue that
	managing multilevel interdependencies is crucial to reduce vulnerability
	of organisational systems. By introducing the multilevel
	conceptualisation of interdependencies and presenting their influence on
	organisational resilience, we hope to pave a path to managing the
	complexity of interdependencies and strategic resilience enhancement in

	Abstract = {Objective
	Despite data linking the social environment to physical inactivity in
	Latinas, research on social network predictors of physical activity (PA)
	is limited. This study examined social network predictors of PA change
	in Latinas.
	Methods
	Egocentric network data were collected from 102 adult Latinas (egos)
	participating in a randomized controlled PA intervention trial for
	underactive women. Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was measured in
	minutes per week using the 7-Day PA Recall Interview and accelerometers
	at baseline and 12 months. Analyses characterized social network
	structure, composition, tie strength, homogeneity, and support for PA
	and determined the relationship between network characteristics and PA
	outcomes.
	Results
	Networks had an average of four social ties (alters). Networks were high
	in density and transitivity and low in components, indicating high
	cohesion. Networks were primarily composed of females, Latinos,
	Spanish-speakers, and family members. Relationship ties were strong as
	evidenced by close living proximity, in-person contact, high emotional
	closeness, and long relationship duration. There was high homogeneity in
	demographics and PA behaviors. Multivariate analyses revealed that
	network size, familial ties, contact frequency, and ego-alter
	dissimilarities in age and running but similarities in walking, were
	associated with increased MVPA. Networks high in support for PA in the
	form of complimenting ego on exercise, taking over chores to allow ego
	to exercise, and co-participating with ego in exercise were also
	associated with greater MVPA.
	Conclusion
	These findings contribute to better understanding interpersonal
	processes that may influence behavior change in a group with especially
	low levels of PA.},

	Abstract = {Epidemic dynamics in complex networks have been extensively studied. Due
	to the similarity between information and disease spreading, most
	studies on information dynamics use epidemic models and merely consider
	the characteristics of online social networks and individual's

	information spreading (OSIS) model combining epidemic models and

	(CA) method to provide a computational method for OSIS. Finally, we use
	OSIS and CA to simulate the spreading and evolution of information in
	online social networks. The experimental results indicate that OSIS is
	effective. Firstly, individual's cognition affects online information
	spreading. When infection rate is low, it prevents the spreading,
	whereas when infection rate is sufficiently high, it promotes
	transmission. Secondly, the explosion of online social network scale and
	the convenience of we-media greatly increase the ability of information
	dissemination. Lastly, the demise of information is affected by both
	time and heat decay rather than probability. We believe that these

	agents is determined by a knowledge transfer rule that the target node
	would preferentially select one neighbor node to transfer knowledge with
	probability p according to their interaction frequency instead of the
	knowledge distance, otherwise, the target node would build a new link
	with its second-order neighbor preferentially or select one node in the
	system randomly with probability 1 - p. The simulation results show
	that, comparing with the Null model defined by the random selection
	mechanism and the traditional knowledge diffusion (TKD) model driven by
	knowledge distance, the knowledge would spread more fast based on SKD
	driven by interaction frequency. In particular, the network structure of
	SKD would evolve as an assortative one, which is a fundamental feature
	of social networks. This work would be helpful for deeply understanding
	the coevolution of the knowledge diffusion and network structure.},

	Abstract = {The existing literature presents ambivalent evidence regarding the
	significance of visual cues, as opposed to textual cues, in the process
	of impression formation. While visual information may have a strong
	effect due to its vividness and immediate absorption, textual
	information might be more powerful due to its solid, unambiguous nature.
	This debate is particularly relevant in the context of online social
	networks, whose users share textual and visual elements. To explore our
	main research question, Which elements of one's Facebook profile have a
	more significant influence on impression formation of
	extroversionpictures or texts? we conducted two complementary online
	experiments, manipulating visual and textual cues inside and outside the
	context of Facebook. We then attempted to identify the relevant
	underlying mechanisms in impression formation. Our findings indicate
	that textual cues play a more dominant role online, whether via Facebook
	or not, supporting assertions of a new-media literacy that is text
	based. Additionally, we found the participants' level of need for
	cognition influenced the effect such that individuals with a high need
	for cognition placed more emphasis on textual cues. The number of likes
	was also a significant predictor of perceptions of the individuals'
	social orientation, especially when the other cues were ambiguous.},

The method first derives a sequence of cocitation networks from a series of equal-length time interval slices. These time-registered networks are merged and visualized in a panoramic view in such a way that intellectually significant articles can be identified based on their visually salient features. The method is applied to a cocitation study of the superstring field in theoretical physics. The study focuses on the search of articles that triggered two superstring revolutions. Visually salient nodes in the panoramic view are identified, and the nature of their intellectual contributions is validated by leading scientists in the field. The analysis has demonstrated that a search for intellectual turning points can be narrowed down to visually salient nodes in the visualized network. The method provides a promising way to simplify otherwise cognitively demanding tasks to a search for landmarks, pivots, and hubs.}}

		abstract = {A fundamental problem in text data mining is to extract meaningful structure from document streams that arrive continuously over time. E-mail and news articles are two natural examples of such streams, each characterized by topics that appear, grow in intensity for a period of time, and then fade away. The published literature in a particular research field can be seen to exhibit similar phenomena over a much longer time scale. Underlying much of the text mining work in this area is the following intuitive premise --- that the appearance of a topic in a document stream is signaled by a "burst of activity," with certain features rising sharply in frequency as the topic emerges.The goal of the present work is to develop a formal approach for modeling such "bursts," in such a way that they can be robustly and efficiently identified, and can provide an organizational framework for analyzing the underlying content. The approach is based on modeling the stream using an infinite-state automaton, in which bursts appear naturally as state transitions; in some ways, it can be viewed as drawing an analogy with models from queueing theory for bursty network traffic. The resulting algorithms are highly efficient, and yield a nested representation of the set of bursts that imposes a hierarchical structure on the overall stream. Experiments with e-mail and research paper archives suggest that the resulting structures have a natural meaning in terms of the content that gave rise to them.},

This paper makes an initial attempt to asses the public reactions and emotions by utilizing the publicly shared \#metoo posts by performing a comparative analysis of the tweets shared on Twitter as well as on Reddit. Though nearly equal ratios of negative and positive posts are shared on both platforms, Reddit posts are focused on the sexual assaults within families and workplaces while Twitter posts are on showing empathy and encouraging others to continue the \#metoo movement. The data collected in this research helps in the preliminary analysis of the user engagement, discussion topics, word connotations and sentiment with respect to the \#metoo movement.},

The data comprise {\textasciitilde}126,000 stories tweeted by {\textasciitilde}3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98\% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.},

The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

Several studies investigated, most prominently on YouTube, how fast a user can get into a misinformation filter bubble simply by selecting “wrong choices” from the items offered. Yet, no studies so far have investigated what it takes to “burst the bubble”, i.e., revert the bubble enclosure. We present a study in which pre-programmed agents (acting as YouTube users) delve into misinformation filter bubbles by watching misinformation promoting content (for various topics). Then, by watching misinformation debunking content, the agents try to burst the bubbles and reach more balanced recommendation mixes. We recorded the search results and recommendations, which the agents encountered, and analyzed them for the presence of misinformation. Our key finding is that bursting of a filter bubble is possible, albeit it manifests differently from topic to topic. Moreover, we observe that filter bubbles do not truly appear in some situations. We also draw a direct comparison with a previous study. Sadly, we did not find much improvements in misinformation occurrences, despite recent pledges by YouTube.},

	abstract = {An eye-opening account of how the hidden rise of personalization on the Internet is controlling-and limiting-the information we consume.   In December 2009, Google began customizing its search results for each user. Instead of giving you the most broadly popular result, Google now tries to predict what you are most likely to click on. According to MoveOn.org board president Eli Pariser, Google's change in policy is symptomatic of the most significant shift to take place on the Web in recent years-the rise of personalization. In this groundbreaking investigation of the new hidden Web, Pariser uncovers how this growing trend threatens to control how we consume and share information as a society-and reveals what we can do about it.  Though the phenomenon has gone largely undetected until now, personalized filters are sweeping the Web, creating individual universes of information for each of us. Facebook-the primary news source for an increasing number of Americans-prioritizes the links it believes will appeal to you so that if you are a liberal, you can expect to see only progressive links. Even an old-media bastion like The Washington Post devotes the top of its home page to a news feed with the links your Facebook friends are sharing. Behind the scenes a burgeoning industry of data companies is tracking your personal information to sell to advertisers, from your political leanings to the color you painted your living room to the hiking boots you just browsed on Zappos.  In a personalized world, we will increasingly be typed and fed only news that is pleasant, familiar, and confirms our beliefs-and because these filters are invisible, we won't know what is being hidden from us. Our past interests will determine what we are exposed to in the future, leaving less room for the unexpected encounters that spark creativity, innovation, and the democratic exchange of ideas.  While we all worry that the Internet is eroding privacy or shrinking our attention spans, Pariser uncovers a more pernicious and far- reaching trend on the Internet and shows how we can- and must-change course. With vivid detail and remarkable scope, The Filter Bubble reveals how personalization undermines the Internet's original purpose as an open platform for the spread of ideas and could leave us all in an isolated, echoing world.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

Should fairness consist of ensuring everyone has an equal probability of obtaining some benefit, or should we aim instead to minimise the harms to the least advantaged? Can the relevant ideal be determined by reference to some alternative state of affairs in which a particular social pattern of discrimination does not exist? Various definitions proposed in recent literature make different assumptions about what terms like discrimination and fairness mean and how they can be defined in mathematical terms. Questions of discrimination, egalitarianism and justice are of significant interest to moral and political philosophers, who have expended significant efforts in formalising and defending these central concepts. It is therefore unsurprising that attempts to formalise ‘fairness’ in machine learning contain echoes of these old philosophical debates. This paper draws on existing work in moral and political philosophy in order to elucidate emerging debates about fair machine learning.},

However, there is a certain amount of confusion about network theory---for example, what it is, what is distinctive about it, and how to generate new theory. This paper attempts to remedy the situation by clarifying the fundamental concepts of the field (such as the network) and characterizing how network reasoning works. We start by considering the definition of network, noting some confusion caused by two different perspectives, which we refer to as realist and nominalist. We then analyze two well-known network theories, Granovetter's strength of weak ties theory [Granovetter, M. S. 1973. The strength of weak ties. Amer. J. Sociol.78(6) 1360--1380] and Burt's structural holes theory [Burt, R. S. 1992. Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition. Havard University Press, Cambridge, MA], to identify characteristic elements of network theorizing. We argue that both theories share an underlying theoretical model, which we label the network flow model, from which we derive additional implications. We also discuss network phenomena that do not appear to fit the flow model and discuss the possibility of a second fundamental model, which we call the bond model. We close with a discussion of the merits of model-based network theorizing for facilitating the generation of new theory, as well as a discussion of endogeneity in network theorizing.},

Rogers, professor and chair of the Department of Communication \& Journalism at the University of New Mexico, explains how new ideas spread via communication channels over time. Such innovations are initially perceived as uncertain and even risky. To overcome this uncertainty, most people seek out others like themselves who have already adopted the new idea. Thus the diffusion process consists of a few individuals who first adopt an innovation, then spread the word among their circle of acquaintances—a process which typically takes months or years. But there are exceptions: use of the Internet in the 1990s, for example, may have spread more rapidly than any other innovation in the history of humankind. Furthermore, the Internet is changing the very nature of diffusion by decreasing the importance of physical distance between people. The fifth edition addresses the spread of the Internet, and how it has transformed the way human beings communicate and adopt new ideas.},

Drawing on research on psychological distance and the “fit” literature, the authors hypothesize that others' recommendations are more persuasive when the construal levels associated with both social distance and temporal distance are congruent. Specifically, the authors first demonstrate a time-contingent effect of recommendation: Others' recommendations lead to a greater preference shift when people make decisions for distant-future consumption than for near-future consumption (Studies 1 and 2). Second, contrary to conventional wisdom, the authors find that close others do not always have a greater impact than distant others. instead, recommendations from close others are more influential in shifting near-future preferences than those from distant others, whereas recommendations from distant others are more influential than those from close others in shifting distant-future preferences (Study 3). The authors demonstrate that others' recommendations are perceived to be more relevant as the underlying mechanism when there is a match of construal levels between the social and temporal distance.

Social-network phenomena seem relevant to obesity, which appears to spread through social ties. This article describes the person-to-person spread of obesity as a potential contributing factor in the U.S. obesity epidemic. Social-network phenomena seem relevant to obesity. The prevalence of obesity has increased from 23\% to 31\% over the recent past in the United States, and 66\% of adults are overweight.1,2 Proposed explanations for the obesity epidemic include societal changes that promote both inactivity and food consumption.3 The fact that the increase in obesity during this period cannot be explained by genetics4,5 and has occurred among all socioeconomic groups1 provides support for a broad set of social and environmental explanations. Since diverse phenomena can spread within social networks,6–10 we conducted a study to determine whether obesity might also spread from person to person, possibly . . .},

One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users’ typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

	abstract = {In this paper we investigate the attributes and relative influence of 1.6M Twitter users by tracking 74 million diffusion events that took place on the Twitter follower graph over a two month interval in 2009. Unsurprisingly, we find that the largest cascades tend to be generated by users who have been influential in the past and who have a large number of followers. We also find that URLs that were rated more interesting and/or elicited more positive feelings by workers on Mechanical Turk were more likely to spread. In spite of these intuitive results, however, we find that predictions of which particular user or URL will generate large cascades are relatively unreliable. We conclude, therefore, that word-of-mouth diffusion can only be harnessed reliably by targeting large numbers of potential influencers, thereby capturing average effects. Finally, we consider a family of hypothetical marketing strategies, defined by the relative cost of identifying versus compensating potential "influencers." We find that although under some circumstances, the most influential users are also the most cost-effective, under a wide range of plausible assumptions the most cost-effective performance can be realized using "ordinary influencers"---individuals who exert average or even less-than-average influence.},

	abstract = {Tracking new topics, ideas, and "memes" across the Web has been an issue of considerable interest. Recent work has developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities. However, these approaches are less well suited to the identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and events.We develop a framework for tracking short, distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a daily basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a "heartbeat"-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. We also develop and analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation that the system exhibits.},

To econometrically identify the effectiveness of different viral features in creating social contagion, we designed and conducted a randomized field experiment involving the 1.4 million friends of 9,687 experimental users on Facebook.com. We find that viral features generate econometrically identifiable peer influence and social contagion effects. More surprisingly, we find that passive-broadcast viral features generate a 246\% increase in peer influence and social contagion, whereas adding active-personalized viral features generate only an additional 98\% increase. Although active-personalized viral messages are more effective in encouraging adoption per message and are correlated with more user engagement and sustained product use, passive-broadcast messaging is used more often, generating more total peer adoption in the network. Our work provides a model for how randomized trials can identify peer influence in social networks. This paper was accepted by Pradeep Chintagunta and Preyas Desai, special issue editors.

Such directed links determine the ﬂow of information and hence indicate a user’s inﬂuence on others—a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing. In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twitter, we present an in-depth comparison of three measures of inﬂuence: indegree, retweets, and mentions. Based on these measures, we investigate the dynamics of user inﬂuence across topics and time. We make several interesting observations. First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily inﬂuential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions. Second, most inﬂuential users can hold signiﬁcant inﬂuence over a variety of topics. Third, inﬂuence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic. We believe that these ﬁndings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the inﬂuence of a user.},

	abstract = {Social media technologies collapse multiple audiences into single contexts, making it difficult for people to use the same techniques online that they do to handle multiplicity in face-to-face conversation. This article investigates how content producers navigate ‘imagined audiences’ on Twitter. We talked with participants who have different types of followings to understand their techniques, including targeting different audiences, concealing subjects, and maintaining authenticity. Some techniques of audience management resemble the practices of ‘micro-celebrity’ and personal branding, both strategic self-commodification. Our model of the networked audience assumes a many-to-many communication through which individuals conceptualize an imagined audience evoked through their tweets.},
