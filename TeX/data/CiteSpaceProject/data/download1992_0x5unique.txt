AB In this paper we develop and test a theory of the dynamic behavior of voluntary groups. The theory combines an image of social network structure with the concept of natural selection to model changes in group composition over time. We consider the group to be a population of members subject to natural selection in sociodemographic space. According to the theory, the probability that members will enter or leave the group depends upon the number and strength of social network ties that connect group members to each other and to nonmembers. We analyze an event history dataset constructed from interviews using Life History Calendar method and information on ego-centered social networks developed from the General Social Survey Network Module. We test the hypothesis that network connections inside a group are associated with reduced membership turnover, while connections outside the group increase turnover. We find that weak ties and network connections that span greater distances in sociodemographic space are positively correlated with leaving current groups and joining new ones. We conclude that weak ties are a major source of change in group composition.

TI SOCIOLINGUISTIC BEHAVIOR IN A DETROIT INNER-CITY BLACK-NEIGHBORHOOD
SO LANGUAGE IN SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB The integration of 66 black Detroit inner-city residents (33 males and 33 females) into their neighborhood is measured quantitatively by a Vernacular Culture Index (VCI) constructed from the respondents' responses to 10 statements, each with values ranging from 1 to 4.  The speech behaviors of these respondents with respect to variants of six linguistic variables (each with a black English [BE] and a colloquial Standard English variant) are quantified and the statistical relationships between the VCI scores and linguistic behavior are determined.  The results of the study reveal that respondents in the older age groups (40-59, 60+) are more likely to choose BE variants than respondents in the younger age groups (18-25, 26-39), and that there are consistent statistically significant correlations between high scores on the VCI and the choice of BE variants of the linguistic variables.  This is taken to support the proposal that the Social Network Theory approach, of which the VCI concept is a part, is capable of explaining intracommunity linguistic variation in socioeconomically homogeneous areas such as the black community studied.

TI BROKERAGE OR FRIENDSHIP - POLITICS AND NETWORKS IN IRELAND
SO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID IRISH
AB Studies of Irish politics have often emphasised clientelist relations between voters and politicians. A survey carried out in the 1970s indicates that the importance of politicians has been overstated. A significant percentage of people chose non-political figures as brokers between themselves and the state. Differences in urban and rural community social structures, which are not reflections of age, education, or socio-economic status, correlate with different brokerage choices. Such findings cast doubt on both modernization and dependency explanations of brokerage. Further research on social networks of friendship and exchange are necessary, since informal personal networks emerge as important links between individuals and the state.

TI CENTRALITY AND THE STRUCTURE OF URBAN INTERACTION - MEASURES, CONCEPTS,
   AND APPLICATIONS
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID CITIES; MODELS; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS; CLIQUE
AB Although social network analysis has provided many measures of network position, these are rarely applied to spatial networks. Sociological measures of network structure were constructed to reflect binary interactions and such measures were of limited use in analysis of urban systems. Recently, several measures have been refined to accommodate the asymmetric continuous flows of people and information across space, making them appropriate for urban models. In this article, we evaluate the applicability of graph theoretic measures to the urban system. We find that graph theoretic conceptualizations of centrality are consistent with theoretical specifications of urban hierarchy. We then apply centrality measures to simulated and actual urban systems. We conclude that such measures elucidate key substantive issues relevant to increasingly complex sociospatial structures.

AB The inclusion of network concepts in the stress-distress model of health represents a major theoretical advance. Most researchers use the dyadic approach of social network analysis to construct network measures of social support. Working from the argument that network structure and social support are conceptually and empirically distinct, we extend the stress-distress model to include measures of network structure (network range) as predictors of exposure to stress, access to social support, and distress. We find that the density, diversity, and size dimensions of network range affect exposure to stress, access to social support, and distress differentially and that, in each case, their effects are gender-specific.
