AB The spread of Internet and online social media has created a huge amount of data able to provide new insights to researchers in different disciplinary fields, but it also presents new challenges for data science. Data arising from online social networks can be naturally coded as relational data in affiliation and adjacency matrices, then analyzed with social network analysis. In this study, we apply an interdisciplinary approach (based on automatic visual content analysis, social network analysis, and exploratory statistical techniques) to define and derive a suitable indicator for characterizing places, along with the online activities of travelers, in terms of sharing images. We envisage a novel storytelling perspective where stories are related to places and the narrative activity is realized through posting images. Specifically, we use data extracted from an online social network (i.e., Instagram) to identify travelers' paths among sites of interests. Starting from a large collection of pictures geolocalized in a pre-specified set of locations (i.e., five locations in the Campania region of Italy during the 2018 Christmas season), we use automatic alternative text to produce an ex-post taxonomy of images on the most recurrent themes emerging from pictures posted on Instagram. Quantitative measures defined on the co-occurrence of locations and the emerging themes are used to build a statistical indicator able to characterize paths among different locations as narrated from travelers' posts. The proposed analysis, presented and discussed along with real data, can be useful for stakeholders interested in the fields of policy-making, communication design, and territory profiling strategies.

AB While great emphasis has been placed on the role of social interactions as a driver of innovation growth, very few empirical studies have explicitly investigated the impact of social network structures on the innovation performance of cities. Past research has mostly explored scaling laws of socio-economic outputs of cities as determined by, for example, the single predictor of population. Here, by drawing on a publicly available dataset of the startup ecosystem, we build the first Workforce Mobility Network among metropolitan areas in the US. We found that node centrality computed on this network accounts for most of the variability observed in cities' innovation performance and significantly outperforms other predictors such as population size or density, suggesting that policies and initiatives aiming at sustaining innovation processes might benefit from fostering professional networks alongside other economic or systemic incentives. As opposed to previous approaches powered by census data, our model can be updated in real-time upon open databases, opening up new opportunities both for researchers in a variety of disciplines to study urban economies in new ways, and for practitioners to design tools for monitoring such economies in real-time.

AB We consider a finite-agent Hellwig (1980) economy with an extension to allow traders to observe their neighbors' signals in an exogenously given social network. There are two potential approaches for traders to process observed signals: directly infer information about the fundamentals from the complete collection of observed signals, or indirectly from an average of observed signals. The two approaches lead to different information sets for traders. In this study, we investigate whether the two economies corresponding to the two approaches are equivalent in the sense that they have the same market equilibrium. For general network and signal structures, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for the equivalence, revealing that the two finite-agent economies are not equivalent in general unless the network structure and signal structure coordinate well. When traders have homogeneous preferences and the signal structure takes the classical form in the literature, we find that the two finite-agent economies are equivalent for regular graphs, but not for chain and star graphs. Finally, for the classical signal structure, we show that the two large economies, defined as the limit of a sequence of replica finite-agent economies, are equivalent for any network structure.

ID KNOWLEDGE; HESITANCY; IMPACT
AB Background COVID-19 vaccine coverage in the Latinx community depends on delivery systems that overcome barriers such as institutional distrust, misinformation, and access to care. We hypothesized that a community-centered vaccination strategy that included mobilization, vaccination, and "activation" components could successfully reach an underserved Latinx population, utilizing its social networks to boost vaccination coverage.
   Methods Our community-academic-public health partnership, "Unidos en Salud," utilized a theory-informed approach to design our "Motivate, Vaccinate, and Activate" COVID-19 vaccination strategy. Our strategy's design was guided by the PRECEDE Model and sought to address and overcome predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination faced by Latinx individuals in San Francisco. We evaluated our prototype outdoor, "neighborhood" vaccination program located in a central commercial and transport hub in the Mission District in San Francisco, using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework during a 16-week period from February 1, 2021 to May 19, 2021. Programmatic data, city-wide COVID-19 surveillance data, and a survey conducted between May 2, 2021 and May 19, 2021 among 997 vaccinated clients >= 16 years old were used in the evaluation.
   Results There were 20,792 COVID-19 vaccinations administered at the neighborhood site during the 16-week evaluation period. Vaccine recipients had a median age of 43 (IQR 32-56) years, 53.9% were male and 70.5% were Latinx, 14.1% white, 7.7% Asian, 2.4% Black, and 5.3% other. Latinx vaccinated clients were substantially more likely than non-Latinx clients to have an annual household income of less than $50,000 a year (76.1% vs. 33.5%), be a first-generation immigrant (60.2% vs. 30.1%), not have health insurance (47.3% vs. 16.0%), and not have access to primary care provider (62.4% vs. 36.2%). The most frequently reported reasons for choosing vaccination at the site were its neighborhood location (28.6%), easy and convenient scheduling (26.9%) and recommendation by someone they trusted (18.1%); approximately 99% reported having an overall positive experience, regardless of ethnicity. Notably, 58.3% of clients reported that they were able to get vaccinated earlier because of the neighborhood vaccination site, 98.4% of clients completed both vaccine doses, and 90.7% said that they were more likely to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to family and friends after their experience; these findings did not substantially differ according to ethnicity. There were 40.3% of vaccinated clients who said they still knew at least one unvaccinated person (64.6% knew >= 3). Among clients who received both vaccine doses (n = 729), 91.0% said that after their vaccination experience, they had personally reached out to at least one unvaccinated person they knew (61.6% reached out to >= 3) to recommend getting vaccinated; 83.0% of clients reported that one or more friends, and/or family members got vaccinated as a result of their outreach, including 18.9% who reported 6 or more persons got vaccinated as a result of their influence.
   Conclusions A multi-component, "Motivate, Vaccinate, and Activate" community-based strategy addressing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination for the Latinx population reached the intended population, and vaccinated individuals served as ambassadors to recruit other friends and family members to get vaccinated.

TI Analysing Twitter semantic networks: the case of 2018 Italian elections
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID CAMPAIGNS; HASHTAG
AB Social media play a key role in shaping citizens' political opinion. According to the Eurobarometer, the percentage of EU citizens employing online social networks on a daily basis has increased from 18% in 2010 to 48% in 2019. The entwinement between social media and the unfolding of political dynamics has motivated the interest of researchers for the analysis of users online behavior-with particular emphasis on group polarization during debates and echo-chambers formation. In this context, semantic aspects have remained largely under-explored. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by adopting a two-steps approach. First, we identify the discursive communities animating the political debate in the run up of the 2018 Italian Elections as groups of users with a significantly-similar retweeting behavior. Second, we study the mechanisms that shape their internal discussions by monitoring, on a daily basis, the structural evolution of the semantic networks they induce. Above and beyond specifying the semantic peculiarities of the Italian electoral competition, our approach innovates studies of online political discussions in two main ways. On the one hand, it grounds semantic analysis within users' behaviors by implementing a method, rooted in statistical theory, that guarantees that our inference of socio-semantic structures is not biased by any unsupported assumption about missing information; on the other, it is completely automated as it does not rest upon any manual labelling (either based on the users' features or on their sharing patterns). These elements make our method applicable to any Twitter discussion regardless of the language or the topic addressed.
