AB While social ties are central to the field of innovation, the research on the relationship between social ties and environmental innovation is lacking. Based on the resource-based view and social network theory, we construct a research model for identifying the relationships between social ties, resource bricolage, and environmental innovation; we use this to examine the impacts of business, political, and research and development (R&D) ties on firms' levels of radical and incremental eco-innovation, as well as the moderating role of resource bricolage. Multiple regression analysis using survey data from 289 Chinese manufacturing firms is conducted. The results show that political and R&D ties can effectively promote radical eco-innovation, while business and political ties promote incremental eco-innovation. Furthermore, resource bricolage plays a positive moderating role in the relationships between firms' political ties and environmental innovation. These conclusions have certain implications for firms, offering useful insight on how to take full advantage of social ties to acquire various resources and harness resource bricolage strategies to support environmental innovation.

TI Multiplex Network Embedding Model with High-Order Node Dependence
SO COMPLEXITY
LA English
DT Article
AB Multiplex networks have been widely used in information diffusion, social networks, transport, and biology multiomics. They contain multiple types of relations between nodes, in which each type of the relation is intuitively modeled as one layer. In the real world, the formation of a type of relations may only depend on some attribute elements of nodes. Most existing multiplex network embedding methods only focus on intralayer and interlayer structural information while neglecting this dependence between node attributes and the topology of each layer. Attributes that are irrelevant to the network structure could affect the embedding quality of multiplex networks. To address this problem, we propose a novel multiplex network embedding model with high-order node dependence, called HMNE. I IMNE simultaneously considers three properties: (1) intralayer high-order proximity of nodes, (2) interlayer dependence in respect of nodes, and (3) the dependence between node attributes and the topology of each layer. In the intralayer embedding phase, we present a symmetric graph convolution-deconvolution model to embed high-order proximity information as the intralayer embedding of nodes in an unsupervised manner. In the interlayer embedding phase, we estimate the local structural complementarity of nodes as an embedding constraint of interlayer dependence. Through these two phases, we can achieve the disentangled representation of node attributes, which can be treated as fined-grained semantic dependence on the topology of each layer. In the restructure phase of node attributes, we perform a linear fusion of attribute disentangled representations for each node as a reconstruction of original attributes. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six real-world networks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in crossdomain link prediction and shared community detection tasks.

AB There is growing interest in social network-based programmes to improve health, but rigorous methods using Social Network research to evaluate the process of these interventions is less well developed. Using data from the "STis And Sexual Health" (STASH) feasibility trial of a school-based, peer-led intervention on sexual health prevention, we illustrate how network data analysis results can address key components of process evaluations for complex interventions-implementation, mechanisms of impacts, and context. STASH trained students as Peer Supporters (PS) to diffuse sexual health messages though face-to-face interactions and online Facebook (FB) groups. We applied a Multilevel Exponential Random Graph modelling approach to analyse the interdependence between offline friendship relationships and online FB ties and how these different relationships align. Our results suggest that the creation of online FB communities mirrored offline adolescent groups, demonstrating fidelity of intervention delivery. Data on informal friendship networks related to student's individual characteristics (i.e., demographics, sexual health knowledge and adherence to norms, which were included for STASH), contributed to an understanding of the social relational 'building' mechanisms that sustain tie-formation. This knowledge could assist the selection of opinion leaders, improving identification of influential peers situated in optimal network positions. This work provides a novel contribution to understanding how to integrate network research with the process evaluation of a network intervention.

TI Towards Exploring the Influence of Community Structures on Information
   Dissemination in Sina Weibo Networks

ID COMPLEX NETWORKS; PROPAGATION
AB The power of online social networks to propagate information within communities and from one community to the next is undeniable. Both network structure and information propagation affect each other; they restrict and cooperate with each other. However, they can also dynamically reshape the network topology of user's social relationship in this process. The above process ultimately forms a feedback loop: the network structure affects how information spreads, while information propagation reshapes network topologies, so both evolve in concert over time. Using information propagation trees (IPT) of posts from the Sina Weibo microblogging site, we conducted a null model-based analysis to determine the influence of community structures on information propagation. We first generated randomized copies of the IPTs and then mined community structures from the originals and copies for comparison. An in-depth examination of the results in terms of improved significant profile, the length of information propagation path, and the relevance of the nodes in the propagation path indirectly reveals the inhibitory effect of community structures on information propagation.

AB Community coalitions can address local issues with deep, historic, and contextual understanding that enables customized implementation of evidence-based strategies. The individuals within the coalition, their partnerships, and the social context is likely an important component of unraveling the challenges of implementation so interventions reach people in need. We focus on the relevance of baseline coalition-committee network (CCN), the networks of purposely formed subcommittees within community coalitions, structure as one of the moderating, theoretical links between community coalition social networks and intervention success. We explore the baseline composition and characteristics of five CCNs at the beginning of childhood obesity prevention interventions. Using a combination of social network, multidimensional scaling, and correspondence analyses, we examine the structure and heterogeneity of five CCNs, each consisting of a core group of stakeholders in the coalition and sometimes the broader community itself. Cross-sectional analyses are used to examine the composition of coalition-committees related to network density, centralization, hierarchy, and coalition demographics and characteristics. Results indicate that CCNs are patterned in their structure and characteristics, and we discuss whether adjustments to childhood obesity prevention interventions according to baseline structure and characteristics could be advantageous for intervention implementation. Together, these findings can inform future longitudinal investigations into CCN network structure.
