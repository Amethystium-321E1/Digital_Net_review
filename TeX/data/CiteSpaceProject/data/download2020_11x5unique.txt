TI Comparative study of social networks in post-socialist Western Balkan

DE social capital; rural development; transition; Western Balkan
AB Rural areas in the Western Balkan are faced with severe socio-economic and political challenges, including a lack of access to knowledge and information as well as scepticism about formal forms of cooperation. Yet, the evidence regarding the influence of social capital and network structures on the access of the rural population to information and knowledge in these countries is still sparse, even though this can be one of the most influential factors shaping rural development. In this paper, a multi-country comparison was applied to provide empirical evidence of the existing level of social capital structures (networks) in North Macedonia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The conducted analyses indicate that even with the low participation rates, all farmers, both members and non-members of organisations, perceived membership in formal organisations as useful. Additionally, the results support the presumption that even sparse informal networks, mostly built on strong personal ties, are more effective channels for information transfer in the absence of efficient/active formalised types of cooperation. 'this implies that rural development policy should be crafted in a way to transform farmers from passive subjects into creative actors, particularly in sharing and promoting good practices.

TI Application of network analysis and cluster analysis for better
   prevention and control of swine diseases in Argentina
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID CATTLE MOVEMENTS; CENTRALITY; PATTERNS
AB Rationale/background Though much smaller than the bovine industry, the porcine sector in Argentina involves a large number of farms and represents a significant economic sector. In recent years Argentina has implemented a national registry of swine movements amongst other measures, in an effort to control and eventually eradicate endemic Aujesky's disease. Such information can prove valuable in assessing the risk of transmission between farms for endemic diseases but also for other diseases at risk of emergence. Methods Shipment data from 2011 to 2016 were analyzed in an effort to define strategic locations and times at which control and surveillance efforts should be focused to provide cost-effective interventions. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to characterize the network as a whole and at the individual farm and market level to help identify important nodes. Spatio-temporal trends of pig movements were also analyzed. Finally, in an attempt to classify farms and markets in different groups based on their SNA metrics, we used factor analysis for mixed data (FAMD) and hierarchical clustering. Results The network involved approximate 136,000 shipments for a total of 6 million pigs. Over 350 markets and 17,800 production units participated in shipments with another 83,500 not participating. Temporal data of shipments and network metrics showed peaks in shipments in September and October. Most shipments where within provinces, with Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe concentrating 61% of shipments. Network analysis showed that markets are involved in relatively few shipments but hold strategic positions with much higher betweenness compared to farms. Hierarchical clustering yielded four groups based on SNA metrics and node characteristics which can be broadly described as: 1. small and backyard farms; 2. industrial farms; 3. markets; and 4. a single outlying market with extreme centrality values. Conclusion Characterizing the network structure and spatio-temporal characteristics of Argentine swine shipments provides valuable information that can guide targeted and more cost-effective surveillance and control programs. We located key nodes where efforts should be prioritized. Pig network characteristics and patterns can be used to create dynamic disease transmission models, which can both be used in assessing the impact of emerging diseases and guiding efforts to eradicate endemic ones.

TI Identifying Leadership Characteristics from Social Media Data during
   Natural Hazards using Personality Traits
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB With the availability of smart devices and affordable data plans, social media platforms have become the primary source of information dissemination across geographically dispersed users/locations. It has shown great potential across different application domains including event detection, opinion analysis, recommendation, and prediction. However, the process of extracting useful information from the collected voluminous social media data during natural hazards is a standing problem that needs significant attention from the research community. The fine-grained knowledge detailing users' participation in information spreading could be advantageous in developing a reliable social network for the adverse events (Natural Hazards, Man-made attacks etc.). However, there has been no such findings related to identification of leader and their leadership characteristics associated with natural hazards in previous studies. We have collected 20.6 million tweets which were posted by 5.3 million users, during distinct devastating hazards namely - Floods, Hurricane, Earthquake and Typhoons. To achieve the goal, we divided our work in to three parts. Firstly, classify the collected crises data into four domains i.e resource, causality, news, and sympathy by employing deeper recurrent neural network model. Secondly, we used statistical physics of complex network to recognize local as well as global prominent leaders. At last, we curate leadership characteristics in terms of their big five personality traits and emotional traits. Our experimental, results find evidence that local leadership behaviour characteristics are significantly different from global potentials. Where as we also finds that some behaviour traits were certain to classified domains (resource, causality, news, and sympathy) and some were certain to hazard divisions, though emotional characteristics remained consistent. Later, we conclude that local potentials leaders have comparatively higher emotional strength. Furthermore, when the complete local network structure is unavailable, we find that the dynamic rank is reliable indexing proxy for local potentials. The current study, provide useful insight to understand how leadership characteristics are influenced to hazards, domains and centrality of users.

AB Understanding the functions carried out by network subgraphs is important to revealing the organizing principles of diverse complex networks. Here, we study this question in the context of collaborative problem-solving, which is central to a variety of domains from engineering and medicine to economics and social planning. We analyze the frequency of all three- and four-node subgraphs in diverse real problem-solving networks. The results reveal a strong association between a dynamic property of network subgraphs-synchronizability-and the frequency and significance of these subgraphs in problem-solving networks. In particular, we show that highly-synchronizable subgraphs are overrepresented in the networks, while poorly-synchronizable subgraphs are underrepresented, suggesting that dynamical properties affect their prevalence, and thus the global structure of networks. We propose the possibility that selective pressures that favor more synchronizable subgraphs could account for their abundance in problem-solving networks. The empirical results also show that unrelated problem-solving networks display very similar local network structure, implying that network subgraphs could represent organizational routines that enable better coordination and control of problem-solving activities. The findings could also have potential implications in understanding the functionality of network subgraphs in other information-processing networks, including biological and social networks.

AB Patent Citation Analysis has been gaining considerable traction over the past few decades. In this paper, we collect extensive information on patents and citations and provide a perspective of citation network analysis of patents from a statistical viewpoint. We identify and analyze the most cited patents, the most innovative and the highly cited companies along with the structural properties of the network by providing in-depth descriptive analysis. Furthermore, we employ Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to analyze the citation networks. ERGMs enables understanding the social perspectives of a patent citation network which has not been studied earlier. We demonstrate that social properties such as homophily (the inclination to cite patents from the same country or in the same language) and transitivity (the inclination to cite references' references) together with the technicalities of the patents (e.g., language, categories), has a significant effect on citations. We also provide an in-depth analysis of citations for sectors in patents and how it is affected by the size of the same. Overall, our paper delves into European patents with the aim of providing new insights and serves as an account for fitting ERGMs on large networks and analyzing them. ERGMs help us model network mechanisms directly, instead of acting as a proxy for unspecified dependence and relationships among the observations.
