AB Clinical Research Networks (CRNs) are means to improve healthcare delivery, quality of care and patient outcomes. The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Latin America's leading health research organization, has established a CRN to promote interaction and collaboration among its clinical research experts. After a decade of operation, a revitalization process was undertaken out of the need to improve its functionality. This study aimed to describe the evaluation process of the Fiocruz Clinical Research Network (RFPC) by gathering the opinions and perspectives of its members and identifying the network structure. The goal was to improve scientific collaboration and member engagement, thereby increasing the integration, effectiveness, and impact of clinical research conducted at the institution. Clinical research professionals at Fiocruz were invited to participate in an online questionnaire to collect information about their professional experience, the benefits and constraints of participating in research networks, relevant discussion topics, and the challenges of complying with Good Clinical Practices (GCP). With the help of social network analysis, a deeper understanding of the dynamics and structure of professional communication networks was obtained. The questionnaire was completed by 122 professionals (response rate 50.4%), with most respondents being principal investigators (PIs) with more than 10 years of professional experience (24.6%). Participation in research networks was considered beneficial, particularly in working groups (48.4%), and as an opportunity to exchange experiences with other professionals (44.3%). Almost half of the participants (48.4%) did not identify any barriers to participating in a network. Topics that required further discussion included data management, biorepositories and biobanks, and ethical and regulatory issues. Challenges to conducting clinical research with GCP standards included strategic support and funding, staffing and training, data management, infrastructure, quality management, and collaboration. Communication within the research network was loosely structured, with the most experienced professionals holding central positions. This analysis provided valuable insights to support the management of the RFPC. It highlighted the internal community's interests and expectations, identified key areas for improvement in GCP implementation, and influential professionals who could improve information sharing and national integration. The findings have far-reaching implications that can be applied in different contexts. They contribute to the ongoing discussion on the establishment and management of research networks.

AB Prior research suggests that members of terrorist groups prioritize forming network ties based on trust to improve their organizational and operational security. The homophily principle, which postulates that individuals tend to form relationships based on shared characteristics, can be a key mechanism through which people identify trustworthy associates. Next to homophily, the mechanism of establishing interconnected relationships through transitivity is also well-known to serve this purpose and shape community structures in social networks. We analyze the community structures of the Islamist co-offending network in the United States, which is highly violent, to assess whether homophily and transitivity determine which extremists form co-offending ties. We rely on a new database on the individual attributes and the co-offending relationships of 494 Islamist offenders radicalized in the United States between 1993 and 2020. Using community detection algorithms, we show that the US Islamist co-offending network is highly clustered, modular, and includes many small but only a few large communities. Furthermore, results from exponential random graph modeling show that transitive relationships as well as spatial proximity, ideological affiliation, and shared socio-cultural characteristics drive co-offending among US Islamist extremists. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the processes of homophily and transitivity shape violent social networks.

AB With the continuous spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation poses serious threats and concerns. COVID-19-related misinformation integrates a mixture of health aspects along with news and political misinformation. This mixture complicates the ability to judge whether a claim related to COVID-19 is information, misinformation, or disinformation. With no standard terminology in information and disinformation, integrating different datasets and using existing classification models can be impractical. To deal with these issues, we aggregated several COVID-19 misinformation datasets and compared differences between learning models from individual datasets versus one that was aggregated. We also evaluated the impact of using several word- and sentence-embedding models and transformers on the performance of classification models. We observed that whereas word-embedding models showed improvements in all evaluated classification models, the improvement level varied among the different classifiers. Although our work was focused on COVID-19 misinformation detection, a similar approach can be applied to myriad other topics, such as the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine.

ID DYNAMICS
AB The pervasive presence and influence of political bots have become the subject of extensive research in recent years. Studies have revealed that a significant percentage of active accounts are bots, contributing to the polarization of public sentiment online. This study employs an agent-based model in conducting computer simulations of complex social networks, to elucidate how bots, representing diverse ideological perspectives, exacerbate societal divisions. To investigate the dynamics of opinion diffusion and shed light on the phenomenon of polarization caused by the activities of political bots, we introduced bots into a bounded-confidence opinion dynamic model for different social networks, whereby the effects of bots on other agents were studied to provide a comprehensive understanding of their influence on opinion dynamics. The simulations showed that the symmetrical deployment of bots on both sides of the opinion spectrum intensifies polarization. These effects were observed within specific tolerance and homophily ranges, with low and high user tolerances slowing down polarization. Moreover, the average path length of the network and the centrality of the bots had a significant impact on the result. Finally, polarization tends to be lower when humans exhibit reduced confidence in bots. This research not only offers valuable insights into the implications of bot activities on the polarization of public opinion and current state of digital society but also provides suggestions to mitigate bot-driven polarization.

AB Social networks are a mathematical representation of interactions among individuals which are prevalent across various animal species. Studies of human populations have shown the breadth of what can spread throughout a social network: obesity, smoking cessation, happiness, drug use and divorce. 'Betweenness centrality' is a key property of social networks that indicates an individual's importance in facilitating communication and cohesion within the network. Heritability of betweenness centrality has been suggested in several species, however the genetic regulation of this property remains enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that the gene CG14109, referred to as degrees of kevin bacon (dokb), influences betweenness centrality in Drosophila melanogaster. We identify strain-specific alleles of dokb with distinct amino acid sequences and when the dokb allele is exchanged between strains, flies exhibit the betweenness centrality pattern dictated by the donor allele. By inserting a GAL4 reporter into the dokb locus, we confirm that dokb is expressed in the central nervous system. These findings define a novel genetic entry point to study social network structure and thereby establish gene-to-social structure relationships. While dokb sequence homology is exclusive to Diptera, we anticipate that dokb-associated molecular pathways could unveil convergent neural mechanisms of social behaviour that apply in diverse animal species.
