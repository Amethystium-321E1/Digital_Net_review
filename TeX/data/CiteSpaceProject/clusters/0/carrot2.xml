<title>Misery Implicitly Loves Company: Implicit Homophily and Bully Victimization</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440211038360</url>
<snippet>This study focuses on the formation of bullied individuals' friendships and romantic relationships. Individuals bullied in their past may be more likely to form connections with those who share similar oppressive experiences. Thus, we investigated the possibility that implicit homophily underlies the formation of interpersonal relationships among previously bullied individuals. Moreover, we investigated whether these individuals were aware of their friends' and romantic partners' similarly oppressive experiences prior to initiating the relationship. Our findings suggest that the young adults in our sample bullied in grade school are significantly more likely to have a close friend and or significant other who also experienced bullying. The findings of this study contribute to the relatively small, yet growing, body of research on implicit homophily, add to research extending homophily processes to bullies and victims, and are in line with research suggesting that deselection (a form of induced homophily) can coexist with homophily by personal preference.

<title>Interpreting change as controllable: The role of network centrality and self-efficacy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0018726712441642</url>
<snippet>Interpreting organizational change initiatives as controllable can mean the difference between achieving positive or negative outcomes. However, little is known about the factors that underpin such interpretations. This study examines how interpretations of controllability are influenced by individual centrality in social networks and change-related self-efficacy. Drawing on a sample of 148 US public school teachers facing a significant organizational transformation, our analysis reveals that change-related self-efficacy fully mediates relationships between centrality within instrumental and expressive organizational social networks and individual interpretations of change controllability. Network centrality, and the associated access to information and social support that accompany it, are theorized to provide the confidence necessary to interpret change as within one's control. Drawing upon social network theory, we provide insights into how change is interpreted as controllable, and how the nature of change may dictate which types of centrality are most important for such interpretations. Implications for the broader understanding of change are also discussed.

<title>Spanish LGBTQ+ Youth and the Role of Online Networks During the First Wave of Covid-19</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/si.v10i2.4950</url>
<snippet>During the lockdown measures put in place at the time of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Spain (March through June 2020), LGBTQ+ youth lived through a particularly stressful situation that has so far received little attention. Confined in homes that are often hostile to their sexuality, struggling with the transition to online classes, they reached out to Internet social networks to obtain the support most of them lack in person. This article explores the role of technology for LGBTQ+ youth during a period when the educational environment was not supportive of students' sexuality and identity needs. The research assesses correlations between the use of online social networks and the perceptions of support received from others (using the concepts of social support, thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness, and cohabitation in their homes). The study involves a sample of 445 Spanish participants aged 13 to 21. A descriptive multivariate analysis of variance and bivariate correlations was performed. We found that social networks were very important for LGBTQ+ youth during the pandemic, helping them to explore their identities, but could also be a source of violence. In this regard, while trans and nonbinary youth's use of social networks to contact acquaintances show important differences when compared to that of gays, lesbians, and bisexuals, the former group also experiences more violence coming from these networks, finds less social support through them, and feels a stronger sense of burdensomeness in relation to them. Additionally, they were often living with people other than family members during the lockdown. This data suggests the need to offer specific support and online services for LGBTQ+ youth, particularly for trans and nonbinary youth.

<title>Global connectedness of local NGOs: do different types of funding create barriers for cooperation?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11186-021-09439-z</url>
<snippet>How does international financial aid affect the cooperative behavior of local non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Can NGOs, while turning global, preserve peer connections with local actors and be engaged in local issues? The civil society literature contains competing perspectives on and reports of how international financial aid may restructure local civic networks. Some scholars argue that international support comes at the expense of local integration as inclusion in global networks takes local NGOs out of the local context, while others find evidence that organizations do not have to face "a forced choice", and may well be integrated both globally and locally. Drawing on this scholarship, we examine two hypotheses on how transnational funding influences cooperation patterns among NGOs. The hierarchy argument states that public entities tend to cooperate with internationally funded NGOs as external contact signals quality and trustworthiness. The segregation argument, on the contrary, suggests financial homophily according to which organizations are more likely to choose peers similar in sources of funding. To test these hypotheses, we apply Exponential Random Graph Models to the data on cooperation among 221 Kazakhstani NGOs. Results support the segregation hypothesis implying that NGOs are likely to have a bias towards similarly funded peers.

<title>Older adults' online social engagement and social capital: the moderating role of Internet skills</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2020.1804980</url>
<snippet>The emergence of social network sites and online communities has offered new possibilities for older adults to stay socially connected and older adults comprise a growing user group of social media. This paper examines the relationship between older adults' online social engagement and social capital based on a national survey of adults aged 60 and over. Findings show that older adults who engage more often in specific online social activities (i.e., asking questions on social media, looking at photos of family members/others) enjoy greater bridging social capital (both in offline and online contexts) than those who do so less often. Furthermore, Internet skills moderate the relationship between online social engagement and social capital. Specifically, older adults with greater Internet skills benefit relatively more from engaging in specific online social activities more often with respect to online bridging. The paper discusses the implications for digital inequality scholarship.

<title>Network domains in social networking sites: expectations, meanings, and social capital</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1050051</url>
<snippet>This paper examines why the use of social networking sites (SNSs) leads to different results in cultivating bridging and bonding social capital for different groups of people. Based on in-depth interviews of 45 university students in Hong Kong, I find that Mainland Chinese students studying in Hong Kong actively use SNSs for seeking practical information about offline matters, and they obtain substantial enacted support from other Mainland students of the same university through SNS use. As a result, they accumulate both bridging and bonding social capital. Local Hong Kong students, however, use SNSs mainly for social information seeking and are only able to accrue limited bridging social capital through SNS use. Drawing on the theory of network domains, I argue that the different offline network structures in which students are located - namely, homogeneous and closed networks versus heterogeneous and open networks - explain this difference. Students with closed offline networks have defined expectations of online ties; they think of their online activities as practical and leading to real changes in their status among peers. Those with open networks have indefinite expectations of their online audience; thus, they interpret online activities differently, thinking of them as recreational, and they are playful in their online behaviour. These different outcomes of online activities consequently lead to diverse results in social capital accrual.

<title>Examining physical and virtual sexual and drug risk venue co-attendance among PrEP-eligible Latinx sexual minority men</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-67814-z</url>
<snippet>Disparities in Latinx sexual minority men (LSMM) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) initiation and adherence demonstrate the need for innovative strategies to improve outcomes along the PrEP Care Continuum. The purpose of this study was to examine physical and virtual risk venue co-attendance among LSMM of varying stages of PrEP use living in South Florida, an Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) priority jurisdiction. Venue co-attendance may be leveraged to support equitable dissemination and implementation (D&amp;I) of HIV and drug use preventive interventions to LSMM. Ninety-four LSMM completed surveys on PrEP use and identified physical and virtual sexual and drug risk venues (where men seek sex partners and/or have sex or access or use drugs). Bivariate analyses examined differences in demographics and venue endorsement by PrEP status. Exponential random graph models examined endorsement of venues by PrEP status. One-mode projection visualizations portray the structure of venue co-attendance networks by PrEP status. Participants identified 49 physical and virtual sexual and drug risk venues. A homophily effect of PrEP status on venue endorsement was identified for both sexual and drug risk venues. Network size and density differed by PrEP status and whether the venue was identified as a sexual or drug risk location. Online dating apps, bars, and saunas had the highest centrality in each network type suggesting their potential role in implementing preventive programming. This study identified specific sexual and drug risk venues that may be leveraged to both disseminate targeted PrEP and harm reduction information and to implement interventions to improve PrEP uptake and adherence among LSMM living in EHE priority jurisdictions.

<title>The microstructures of network recall: How social networks are encoded and represented in human memory</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.11.003</url>
<snippet>A growing number of studies indicate that aspects of psychology and cognition influence network structure, but much remains to be learned about how network information is stored and retrieved from memory. Are networks recalled as dyads, as triads, or more generally as sub-groups? We employ an experimental design coupled with exponential random graph models to address this issue. We find that respondents flexibly encode social information as triads or groups, depending on the network, but not as dyads. This supports prior research showing that networks are stored using "compression heuristics", but also provides evidence of cognitive flexibility in the process of encoding relational information.

<title>Contact activity and dynamics of the social core</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0103-y</url>
<snippet>Humans interact through numerous communication channels to build and maintain social connections: they meet face-to-face, make phone calls or send text messages, and interact via social media. Although it is known that the network of physical contacts, for example, is distinct from the network arising from communication events via phone calls and instant messages, the extent to which these networks differ is not clear. We show here that the network structure of these channels show large structural variations. The various channels account for diverse relationships between pairs of individuals and the corresponding interaction patterns across channels differ to an extent that social ties cannot easily be reduced to a single layer. Each network of interactions, however, contains both central and peripheral individuals: central members are characterized by higher connectivity and can reach a large fraction of the network within a low number of steps, in contrast to the nodes on the periphery. The origin and purpose of each communication network also determine the role of their respective central members: highly connected individuals in the person-to-person networks interact with their environment in a regular manner, while members central in the social communication networks display irregular behavior with respect to their physical contacts and are more active through irregular social events. Our results suggest that due to the inherently different functions of communication channels, each one favors different social behaviors and different strategies for interacting with the environment. These findings can facilitate the understanding of the varying roles and impact individuals have on the population, which can further shed light on the prediction and prevention of epidemic outbreaks, or information propagation.

<title>Correcting misinformation by health organizations during measles outbreaks: A controlled experiment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209505</url>
<snippet>Background During epidemic crises, some of the information the public receives on social media is misinformation. Health organizations are required to respond and correct the information to gain the public's trust and influence it to follow the recommended instructions. Objectives (1) To examine ways for health organizations to correct misinformation concerning the measles vaccination on social networks for two groups: pro-vaccination and hesitant; (2) To examine the types of reactions of two subgroups (pro-vaccination, hesitant) to misinformation correction; and (3) To examine the effect of misinformation correction on these two subgroups regarding reliability, satisfaction, self-efficacy and intentions. Methods A controlled experiment with participants divided randomly into two conditions. In both experiment conditions a dilemma was presented as to sending a child to kindergarten, followed by an identical Facebook post voicing the children mothers' concerns. In the third stage the correction by the health organization is presented differently in two conditions: Condition 1 -common information correction, and Condition 2-recommended (theory-based) information correction, mainly communicating information transparently and addressing the public's concerns. The study included (n = 243) graduate students from the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences at Haifa University. Results A statistically significant difference was found in the reliability level attributed to information correction by the Health Ministry between the Control condition and Experimental condition (sig&lt;0.001), with the average reliability level of the subjects in Condition 2 (M = 5.68) being considerably higher than the average reliability level of subjects in Condition 1 (4.64). A significant difference was found between Condition 1 and Condition 2 (sig&lt;0.001), with the average satisfaction from the Health Ministry's response of Condition 2 subjects (M = 5.75) being significantly higher than the average satisfaction level of Condition 1 subjects (4.66). Similarly, when we tested the pro and hesitant groups separately, we found that both preferred the response presented in Condition 2. Conclusion It is very important for the organizations to correct misinformation transparently, and to address the emotional aspects for both the pro-vaccination and the hesitant groups. The pro-vaccination group is not a captive audience, and it too requires a full response that addresses the public's fears and concerns.

<title>A multi-component, community-based strategy to facilitate COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Latinx populations: From theory to practice</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257111</url>
<snippet>Background COVID-19 vaccine coverage in the Latinx community depends on delivery systems that overcome barriers such as institutional distrust, misinformation, and access to care. We hypothesized that a community-centered vaccination strategy that included mobilization, vaccination, and "activation" components could successfully reach an underserved Latinx population, utilizing its social networks to boost vaccination coverage. Methods Our community-academic-public health partnership, "Unidos en Salud," utilized a theory-informed approach to design our "Motivate, Vaccinate, and Activate" COVID-19 vaccination strategy. Our strategy's design was guided by the PRECEDE Model and sought to address and overcome predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination faced by Latinx individuals in San Francisco. We evaluated our prototype outdoor, "neighborhood" vaccination program located in a central commercial and transport hub in the Mission District in San Francisco, using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework during a 16-week period from February 1, 2021 to May 19, 2021. Programmatic data, city-wide COVID-19 surveillance data, and a survey conducted between May 2, 2021 and May 19, 2021 among 997 vaccinated clients &gt;= 16 years old were used in the evaluation. Results There were 20,792 COVID-19 vaccinations administered at the neighborhood site during the 16-week evaluation period. Vaccine recipients had a median age of 43 (IQR 32-56) years, 53.9&#37; were male and 70.5&#37; were Latinx, 14.1&#37; white, 7.7&#37; Asian, 2.4&#37; Black, and 5.3&#37; other. Latinx vaccinated clients were substantially more likely than non-Latinx clients to have an annual household income of less than $50,000 a year (76.1&#37; vs. 33.5&#37;), be a first-generation immigrant (60.2&#37; vs. 30.1&#37;), not have health insurance (47.3&#37; vs. 16.0&#37;), and not have access to primary care provider (62.4&#37; vs. 36.2&#37;). The most frequently reported reasons for choosing vaccination at the site were its neighborhood location (28.6&#37;), easy and convenient scheduling (26.9&#37;) and recommendation by someone they trusted (18.1&#37;); approximately 99&#37; reported having an overall positive experience, regardless of ethnicity. Notably, 58.3&#37; of clients reported that they were able to get vaccinated earlier because of the neighborhood vaccination site, 98.4&#37; of clients completed both vaccine doses, and 90.7&#37; said that they were more likely to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to family and friends after their experience; these findings did not substantially differ according to ethnicity. There were 40.3&#37; of vaccinated clients who said they still knew at least one unvaccinated person (64.6&#37; knew &gt;= 3). Among clients who received both vaccine doses (n = 729), 91.0&#37; said that after their vaccination experience, they had personally reached out to at least one unvaccinated person they knew (61.6&#37; reached out to &gt;= 3) to recommend getting vaccinated; 83.0&#37; of clients reported that one or more friends, and/or family members got vaccinated as a result of their outreach, including 18.9&#37; who reported 6 or more persons got vaccinated as a result of their influence. Conclusions A multi-component, "Motivate, Vaccinate, and Activate" community-based strategy addressing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination for the Latinx population reached the intended population, and vaccinated individuals served as ambassadors to recruit other friends and family members to get vaccinated.

<title>General and health-related social media use among adults with children in the household: Findings from a national survey in the United States</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2021.07.003</url>
<snippet>Objective: Examine predictors of social media use among a nationally representative sample of adults with children in the household. Methods: Data were collected from the Health Information National Trends (HINTS) Survey from 2017 to 2020 (N = 3559). Multivariate logistic regression models assessed the association between sociodemographic variables and social networking site (SNS) use, SNS use to share health information, participation in online forum or support groups for health issues and watching health-related videos on YouTube. Results: Older adults and men were significantly less likely to use social media (p &lt; .05). Non-Hispanic African American (aOR: 1.83; 95&#37;CI: 1.30-2.57), Hispanic (aOR: 2.16; 95&#37;CI: 1.56-2.99), and Asian (aOR: 2.82; 95&#37;CI: 1.67-4.75) adults were more likely to watch health-related videos on YouTube. Conclusions: Racial/ethnic minorities with children in the household were more likely to seek health information on YouTube, highlighting opportunities to disseminate culturally relevant, accurate messages on the platform. Effective health communication targeted to specific demographics can help counter misinformation and promote health behavior particularly during public health emergencies. Practice Implications: Providers need to foster trust so that patients are comfortable to ask questions in addition to seeking information online. Providers can direct patients to credible resources to counter misinformation exposure and promote healthy behavior. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Wild jackdaws can selectively adjust their social associations while preserving valuable long-term relationships</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40808-7</url>
<snippet>Influential theories of the evolution of cognition and cooperation posit that tracking information about others allows individuals to adjust their social associations strategically, re-shaping social networks to favour connections between compatible partners. Crucially, to our knowledge, this has yet to be tested experimentally in natural populations, where the need to maintain long-term, fitness-enhancing relationships may limit social plasticity. Using a social-network-manipulation experiment, we show that wild jackdaws (Corvus monedula) learned to favour social associations with compatible group members (individuals that provided greater returns from social foraging interactions), but resultant change in network structure was constrained by the preservation of valuable pre-existing relationships. Our findings provide insights into the cognitive basis of social plasticity and the interplay between individual decision-making and social-network structure.

<title>Social capital and employee well-being: disentangling intrapersonal and interpersonal selection and influence mechanisms</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3917/rfs.493.0613</url>
<snippet>We argue that sociological explanations proposed within the social capital framework to explain individual well-being are incomplete because they do not differentiate between interpersonal influence and selection mechanisms, on the one hand, and cognitive intra-personal processes. on the other. To this end. three theoretical models of the dynamic interaction between interpersonal trust and job satisfaction will be used to derive and empirically test six hypotheses. First, according to influence mechanisms, an individual's job satisfaction can be the result of the number of sociometric trust choices he or she receives (popularity effect) or the level of job satisfaction of those actors he/she trusts (contagion effect). Second, selection mechanisms postulate that a focal actor will be more likely to develop interpersonal trust in colleagues with a high job satisfaction (attractiveness effect) or with similar levels of job satisfaction as the focal actor (homophily effect). Third, according to intrapersonal spillover mechanisms, a high level of job satisfaction can either facilitate the creation of interpersonal trust relationships (satisfaction spillover effect), or individuals initiating a high number of interpersonal trust relationships can exhibit higher levels of satisfaction (trust spillover effect). To simultaneously test these six hypotheses, longitudinal intra-organizational social network data from a Dutch housing company (n = 57) were used. We found a significant contagion effect, but no support for a popularity effect or either selection effect. Moreover, contrary to what we expected, employees with a low level of job satisfaction were significantly more likely to develop trust relationships with others.

<title>Explaining Attitude-Consistent Exposure on Social Network Sites: The Role of Ideology, Political Involvement, and Network Characteristics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393211056224</url>
<snippet>There are rising concerns that social network sites (SNS) facilitate the creation of echo chambers, in which attitude-consistent information becomes the norm while attitude-challenging information is avoided. This study aims to investigate theoretically derived predictors of attitude-consistent and attitude-challenging exposure on SNS. We theorize that three key sets of predictors may influence attitude-consistent and attitude-challenging exposure: ideology, cognitive, and behavioral indicators of political involvement, and network characteristics. In a two-wave panel study, we predict the frequency of attitude-consistent and attitude-challenging exposure as well as relative attitude-consistent exposure, measured as attitude-consistent exposure as a share of overall opinion exposure. The results demonstrate that extreme ideological positions, higher political knowledge, and low-effort political participation predicted an increase in (relative) attitude-consistent exposure. Cross-social class exposure predicted a decrease in (relative) attitude-consistent exposure. The findings challenge existing arguments that SNS may per se facilitate attitude-consistent exposure.

<title>Hidden messages: mapping nations' media campaigns</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-023-09382-7</url>
<snippet>Powerful actors have engaged in information control for centuries, restricting, promoting, or influencing the information environment as it suits their evolving agendas. In the Digital Age, information control has moved online, and information operations now target the online platforms that play a critical role in news engagement and civic debate. In this paper, we use a discrete-time stochastic model to analyze coordinated activity in an online social network, representing the behaviors of accounts as interacting Markov chains. From a dataset of 31,521 tweets posted by 206 accounts, half of which were identified by Twitter as participating in a state-linked information operation, we evaluate the coordination, measured by the apparent influence, between pairs of state-linked accounts compared to unaffiliated accounts. Our analysis reveals that state-linked actors demonstrate significantly higher levels of coordination among themselves compared to their coordination with unaffiliated accounts. Furthermore, the degree of coordination observed between state-linked accounts is more than seven times greater than the coordination observed between unaffiliated accounts. Moreover, we find that the account that represented the most coordinated activity in the network had no followers, demonstrating the power of our modeling approach to unearth hidden connections even in the absence of explicit network structure.

<title>"It's like these CHCs don't exist, are they featured anywhere?": Social network analysis of community health committees in a rural and urban setting in Kenya</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220836</url>
<snippet>Background In Kenya, Community Health Committees (CHC) were established to enhance community participation in health services. Their role is to provide leadership, oversight in delivery of community health services, promote social accountability and mobilize resources for community health. CHCs form social networks with other actors, with whom they exchange health information for decision-making and accountability. This case study aimed to explore the structure of a rural and an urban CHC network and to analyze how health-related information flowed in these networks. Understanding the pathways of information in community settings may provide recommendations for strategies to improve the role and functioning of CHCs. Methods In 2017, we conducted 4 focus group discussions with 27 community discussants and 10 semi-structured interviews with health professionals in a rural area and an urban slum. Using social network analysis, we determined the structure of their social networks and how health related information flowed in these networks. Results Both CHCs were composed of respected persons nominated by their communities. Each social network had 12 actors that represented both community and government institutions. CHCs were not central actors in the exchange of health-related information. Health workers, community health volunteers and local Chiefs in the urban slum often passed information between the different groups of actors, while CHCs hardly did this. Therefore, CHCs had little control over the flow of health-related information. Although CHC members were respected persons who served in multiple roles within their communities, this did not enhance their centrality. It emerged that CHCs were often left out in the flow of health-related information and decision-making, which led to demotivation. Community health volunteers were more involved by other actors such as health managers and non-governmental organizations as a conduit for health-related information. Conclusion Social network analysis demonstrated how CHCs played a peripheral role in the flow of health-related information. Their perception of being left out of the information flow led to demotivation, which hampered their ability to facilitate community participation in community health services; hence challenging effective participation through CHCs.

<title>What Makes Weak Ties Strong?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-030921-034152</url>
<snippet>We raise two challenges concerning the validity of arguments underlying Granovetter's strength of weak ties (SWT) thesis: (a) whether weak ties are actually bridges, i.e., they help reach more socially distant actors than strong ties, and (b) whether weak ties transmit information effectively enough so that weak ties' alleged structural properties make them more useful than strong ties. In the course of reviewing subsequent research that has made progress in addressing these challenges, we identify both potential limits and possibilities for the SWT thesis. We argue for the importance of identifying how actors' agency-i.e., the way people use their ties-may affect social networks' value. We conclude by summarizing some outstanding questions that progress on the SWT thesis has generated.

<title>Social network research and human subjects protection: Towards more effective infectious disease control</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2005.01.006</url>
<snippet>The issue of human subject protection in relation to social network research on the spread and control of human pathogens is considered. As this area derives most of its concepts and methods from social network analysis more generally, the present discussion has wider relevance. One problem is that some Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) have assumed that if a participant (who gave informed consent) is to be asked to name network associates these too - automatically - would be human subjects from whom informed consent also must be obtained. Invariably, if this occurs proposed research - whatever its funding and potential contributions might be - is blocked. A conservative approach is taken here. The Common Rule is assumed to provide relevant guidance, the responsibility of IRBs is to make decisions based on the Common Rule, and in consequence the burden is on those proposing social network research to design - and defend - their planned work with this in mind. At the same time, it is argued that it is important not to stifle beneficial research by adding to one inherently conservative review process (of grant proposals) another (of IRBs) so that work is prevented simply because it is research at the frontiers rather than 'safe' research, © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

<title>Vertical organizations, flat networks: Centrality and criminal collaboration in the Italian-American Mafia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.06.001</url>
<snippet>While criminal organizations often feature hierarchical positions, scholars debate the extent to which networks of informal collaboration among criminals reflect such hierarchies. This research uses historical data on collaboration involving more than 700 criminals across 24 Italian-American Mafia families and applies network regression models and simulations to determine whether mafiosi of similar centrality-based status were more likely to be criminal associates than mafiosi of dissimilar status. Rather than forming vertical collaborations linking mafia members into a centralized, hierarchical network structure, we find that mafiosi collaborated disproportionately more with colleagues of similar status. While network centrality predicted tie formation, formal rank in an organizational chart generally did not. Knowledge simply of a covert organization's formal structure may not translate to understanding "on-the-ground" collaborations.

<title>Innovation network structure, government R&amp;D investment and regional innovation efficiency: Evidence from China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286096</url>
<snippet>Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2019, this paper uses a two-stage DEA model to measure regional innovation efficiency, then non-parametric test is used to examine the impact of innovation network structure and government R&amp;D investment on regional innovation efficiency. The results show that, at the provincial level, innovation efficiency of regional R&amp;D is not necessarily in direct proportion to the innovation efficiency in the commercialization stage. Commercialization efficiency is not necessarily high in provinces with high technical R&amp;D efficiency. At the national level, the innovation efficiency gap between our country's R&amp;D and commercialization stage is small, indicating that the development of the national innovation efficiency is more and more balanced. Innovation network structure can promote the R&amp;D efficiency, but has no significant effect on the commercialization efficiency. Government R&amp;D investment helps to improve the R&amp;D efficiency, but it is not conducive to the improvement of commercialization efficiency. The interaction between innovation network structure and government R&amp;D investment will have compound effects on regional innovation efficiency; the region with underdeveloped innovation network structure can increase the government R&amp;D investment to make it have a higher level of R&amp;D. This paper provides insights into how to improve innovation efficiency in different social networks and policy environments.

<title>A systematic review of worldwide causal and correlational evidence on digital media and democracy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-022-01460-1</url>
<snippet>One of today's most controversial and consequential issues is whether the global uptake of digital media is causally related to a decline in democracy. We conducted a systematic review of causal and correlational evidence (N = 496 articles) on the link between digital media use and different political variables. Some associations, such as increasing political participation and information consumption, are likely to be beneficial for democracy and were often observed in autocracies and emerging democracies. Other associations, such as declining political trust, increasing populism and growing polarization, are likely to be detrimental to democracy and were more pronounced in established democracies. While the impact of digital media on political systems depends on the specific variable and system in question, several variables show clear directions of associations. The evidence calls for research efforts and vigilance by governments and civil societies to better understand, design and regulate the interplay of digital media and democracy. This systematic review on digital media and democracy finds beneficial relationships mostly in emerging democracies but detrimental associations in established democracies for different political variables across methods.

<title>The Relationship Between Emotional Dependence on Facebook and Psychological Well-Being in Adolescents Aged 13-16</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12187-016-9438-3</url>
<snippet>In most countries, Facebook is one of the top social networking sites among children and adolescents. Several studies have investigated the effect of Facebook dependency on individuals' psychological well-being. However, inadequate studies have examined the impacts of Facebook in eudaimonic well-being. The current study explores how emotional dependence on Facebook relates to psychological well-being in eudaimonic approach. A total of 401, 13 to 16 yearsold who studied at an upper secondary school in Malaysia participated in this study. We expected a negative association between emotional dependence on Facebook and psychological wellbeing. The moderation effect of self-efficacy was examined in the current research. The results of structural equation modeling revealed that emotional dependence on Facebook negatively effects adolescents' overall psychological well-being. The influence was more pronounced on autonomy, purpose in life, and positive relationship with others. The results also demonstrated that high self-efficacy did not reduce negative impacts of Facebook emotional dependence on adolescents' psychological well-being.

<title>The Strength of Structural Diversity in Online Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.34133/2021/9831621</url>
<snippet>Understanding the way individuals are interconnected in social networks is of prime significance to predict their collective outcomes. Leveraging a large-scale dataset from a knowledge-sharing website, this paper presents an exploratory investigation of the way to depict structural diversity in directed networks and how it can be utilized to predict one's online social reputation. To capture the structural diversity of an individual, we first consider the number of weakly and strongly connected components in one's contact neighborhood and further take the coexposure network of social neighbors into consideration. We show empirical evidence that the structural diversity of an individual is able to provide valuable insights to predict personal online social reputation, and the inclusion of a coexposure network provides an additional ingredient to achieve that goal. After synthetically controlling several possible confounding factors through matching experiments, structural diversity still plays a nonnegligible role in the prediction of personal online social reputation. Our work constitutes one of the first attempts to empirically study structural diversity in directed networks and has practical implications for a range of domains, such as social influence and collective intelligence studies.

<title>Predicting Opinion Leaders in Twitter Activism Networks: The Case of the Wisconsin Recall Election</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764214527091</url>
<snippet>This study employs content and network analysis techniques to explore the predictors of opinion leadership in a political activism network on Twitter. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using user-generated content to measure user characteristics. The characteristics were analyzed to predict users' performance in the network. According to the results, Twitter users with higher connectivity and issue involvement are better at influencing information flow on Twitter. User connectivity was measured by betweenness centrality, and issue involvement was measured by a user's geographic proximity to a given event and the contribution of engaging tweets. In addition, the results show that tweets by organizations had greater influence than those by individual users.

<title>Measuring Social Capital: Accounting for Nested Data and Subnetworks Within Schools</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-015-0945-2</url>
<snippet>Social capital is a central concept in social science research, and it is measured in diverse ways. Few measurement approaches take the network structure of complex institutional settings into account. In this study, using data from a large-scale school-based randomized field trial, we develop several factor analytic models to test the validity and reliability of a new survey battery capturing multiple dimensions of social capital in such settings. We demonstrate that it is important to account for institutional and network structure in social capital measures, and we show how social capital can be operationalized as the shared variance between different relational characteristics in complex settings with multiple subnetworks.

<title>Social network composition of vascular patients and its associations with health behavior and clinical risk factors</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185341</url>
<snippet>Background This study aimed to explore linkages of patients' social network composition with health behaviors and clinical risk factors. Methods/Design This observational study was embedded in a project aimed at improving cardiovascular risk management (CRVM) in primary care. 657 vascular patients (227 with cardiovascular disease, 380 at high vascular risk), mean age 72.4 (SD 9.4) years, were recruited as were individuals patients considered important for dealing with their disease, so called alters (n = 487). Network composition was measured with structured patient questionnaires. Both patients and alters completed questionnaires to measure health behavior (habits for physical activity, diet, and smoking). Clinical risk factors (systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol level, and body mass index) were extracted from patients' medical records. Six logistic regression analyses, using generalized estimating equations, were used to test three hypothesized effects of network composition (having alters with healthful behaviors, without depression, and with specialized knowledge) on six outcomes, adjusted for demographic, personal and psychological characteristics. Results Having alters with overall healthful behavior was related to healthful patient diet (OR 2.14, 95&#37; CI: 1.52-3.02). Having non-smoking alters in networks was related to reduced odds for patient smoking (OR 0.17, 95&#37; CI: 0.05-0.60). No effects of presence of non-depressed alters were found. Presence of alters with specialized knowledge on CVRM was inversely related to healthful diet habits of patients (OR 0.47, 95&#37; CI 0.24-0.89). No significant associations between social network composition and clinical risk factors were found. Discussion Diet and smoking, but not physical exercise and clinical risk factors, were associated with social network composition of patients with vascular conditions. In this study of vascular patients, controlling for both personal and psychological factors, fewer network influences were found compared to previous research. Further research is needed to examine network structure characteristics as well as the role of psychological factors to enhance understanding health behavior of patients involved in CVRM.

<title>Shaping opinions in social networks with shadow banning</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299977</url>
<snippet>The proliferation of harmful content and misinformation on social networks necessitates content moderation policies to maintain platform health. One such policy is shadow banning, which limits content visibility. The danger of shadow banning is that it can be misused by social media platforms to manipulate opinions. Here we present an optimization based approach to shadow banning that can shape opinions into a desired distribution and scale to large networks. Simulations on real network topologies show that our shadow banning policies can shift opinions and increase or decrease opinion polarization. We find that if one shadow bans with the aim of shifting opinions in a certain direction, the resulting shadow banning policy can appear neutral. This shows the potential for social media platforms to misuse shadow banning without being detected. Our results demonstrate the power and danger of shadow banning for opinion manipulation in social networks.

<title>Link recommendation algorithms and dynamics of polarization in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2102141118</url>
<snippet>The level of antagonism between political groups has risen in the past years. Supporters of a given party increasingly dislike members of the opposing group and avoid intergroup interactions, leading to homophilic social networks. While new connections offline are driven largely by human decisions, new connections on online social platforms are intermediated by link recommendation algorithms, e.g., "People you may know" or "Whom to follow" suggestions. The long-term impacts of link recommendation in polarization are unclear, particularly as exposure to opposing viewpoints has a dual effect: Connections with out-group members can lead to opinion convergence and prevent group polarization or further separate opinions. Here, we provide a complex adaptive-systems perspective on the effects of link recommendation algorithms. While several models justify polarization through rewiring based on opinion similarity, here we explain it through rewiring grounded in structural similarity-defined as similarity based on network properties. We observe that preferentially establishing links with structurally similar nodes (i.e., sharing many neighbors) results in network topologies that are amenable to opinion polarization. Hence, polarization occurs not because of a desire to shield oneself from disagreeable attitudes but, instead, due to the creation of inadvertent echo chambers. When networks are composed of nodes that react differently to out-group contacts, either converging or polarizing, we find that connecting structurally dissimilar nodes moderates opinions. Overall, our study sheds light on the impacts of social-network algorithms and unveils avenues to steer dynamics of radicalization and polarization in online social networks.

<title>Social media sensors as early signals of influenza outbreaks at scale</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-024-00474-1</url>
<snippet>Detecting early signals of an outbreak in a viral process is challenging due to its exponential nature, yet crucial given the benefits to public health it can provide. If available, the network structure where infection happens can provide rich information about the very early stages of viral outbreaks. For example, more central nodes have been used as social network sensors in biological or informational diffusion processes to detect early contagious outbreaks. We aim to combine both approaches to detect early signals of a biological viral process (influenza-like illness, ILI), using its informational epidemic coverage in public social media. We use a large social media dataset covering three years in a country. We demonstrate that it is possible to use highly central users on social media, more precisely high out-degree users from Twitter, as sensors to detect the early signals of ILI outbreaks in the physical world without monitoring the whole population. We also investigate other behavioral and content features that distinguish those early sensors in social media beyond centrality. While high centrality on Twitter is the most distinctive feature of sensors, they are more likely to talk about local news, language, politics, or government than the rest of the users. Our new approach could detect a better and smaller set of social sensors for epidemic outbreaks and is more operationally efficient and privacy respectful than previous ones, not requiring the collection of vast amounts of data.

<title>The gender gap in job authority: Do social network resources matter?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0001699319847504</url>
<snippet>Women generally have less job authority than men. Previous research has shown that human capital, family features and contextual factors cannot fully explain this gender authority gap. Another popular explanation holds that women's career opportunities are limited because their social networks comprise less beneficial contacts and resources than men's. Yet, the role of social networks has received little attention in empirical research seeking to explain the gender gap in job authority. This study examines to what extent gender differences in social networks exist and are related to the gender authority gap. Drawing on two strands of social network theory, we develop hypotheses about the role of network diversity and network status. We test these hypotheses using representative longitudinal data from the NEtherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study (2009-2013). Results reveal that women generally had less diverse occupational networks in terms of contacts' occupations and were less likely to know managers than men, network features which are found to be significantly related to job authority. Controlling for these gender differences in networks leads to a reduction of the observed gender authority gap that is statistically significant but modest in substantive terms.

<title>Online social integration is associated with reduced mortality risk</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1605554113</url>
<snippet>Social interactions increasingly take place online. Friendships and other offline social ties have been repeatedly associated with human longevity, but online interactions might have different properties. Here, we reference 12 million social media profiles against California Department of Public Health vital records and use longitudinal statistical models to assess whether social media use is associated with longer life. The results show that receiving requests to connect as friends online is associated with reduced mortality but initiating friendships is not. Additionally, online behaviors that indicate face-to-face social activity (like posting photos) are associated with reduced mortality, but online-only behaviors (like sending messages) have a nonlinear relationship, where moderate use is associated with the lowest mortality. These results suggest that online social integration is linked to lower risk for a wide variety of critical health problems. Although this is an associational study, it may be an important step in understanding how, on a global scale, online social networks might be adapted to improve modern populations' social and physical health.

<title>Social Isolation in America</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-071312-145646</url>
<snippet>We offer a new measure for social isolation for contemporary society, where opportunities for making connections with others have become ubiquitous. We develop this measure after reviewing previous research on social isolation that we segment into two perspectives. On the one side, isolation has been studied as a negative outcome of processes related to modernization; on the other side, isolation has been studied as a structural position potentially capable of delivering positive returns. Although academic interest in isolation is long-standing, recent years have seen an explosion of research on the topic. We explore the connection between this explosion and new social media and highlight a division within the literature between researchers who see new social media as creating more feelings of isolation and others who think that the jury is still out. In the final section of the article, we offer our novel conceptual framework for studying isolation.

<title>Analyzing the factors that influence the seeking and sharing of information on the smart city digital platform: Empirical evidence from Indonesia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.101876</url>
<snippet>Smart city initiatives are considered as the solutions for urban problems. One dimension of a smart city, i.e., smart people/society, suggests that a smart city requires high-quality social interactions and social relationships that help cities connect with their residents and the outside world. For this purpose, smart cities in Indonesia have developed digital platforms (internet websites and mobile applications) to disseminate the cities' programs and information and facilitate sharing of information among its residents. This study aimed to investigate the factors that affect the seeking and sharing of information on the smart city digital platforms. We used a quantitative approach by conducting surveys in 8 smart cities in Indonesia, with 1161 respondents. The survey data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that social factors (sense of belonging and seeking reputations) have dominant roles in determining residents' intention to seek information on smart city platforms. In turn, the intention to seek information is the key factor that affects the residents' intention to share information on the smart city platforms and on their online social network. This paper provides insights on the factors that need more attention from smart city administrators to improve resident engagement and enhance the dimension of smart people.

<title>Structural transition in social networks: The role of homophily</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-40990-z</url>
<snippet>We introduce a model for the formation of social networks, which takes into account the homophily or the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others, and the mechanisms of global and local attachment as well as tie reinforcement due to social interactions between people. We generalize the weighted social network model such that the nodes or individuals have Ffeatures and each feature can have q different values. Here the tendency for the tie formation between two individuals due to the overlap in their features represents homophily. We find a phase transition as a function of F or q, resulting in a phase diagram. For fixed q and as a function of F the system shows two phases separated at F-c. For F &lt; F-c large, homogeneous, and well separated communities can be identified within which the features match almost perfectly (segregated phase). When F becomes larger than Fc the nodes start to belong to several communities and within a community the features match only partially (overlapping phase). Several quantities reflect this transition, including the average degree, clustering coefficient, feature overlap, and the number of communities per node. We also make an attempt to interpret these results in terms of observations on social behavior of humans.

<title>Mapping the two levels of digital divide: Internet access and social network site adoption among older adults in the USA</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1109695</url>
<snippet>Older adults have increasingly adopted Internet and social network sites (SNSs), but little communication scholarship has explored systematic differences in access within this population. Using a nationally representative sample of Americans over the age of 50 years from the 2012 Health and Retirement Study, we examine Internet access (N=18,851) and SNS adoption patterns (N=869) among this sample and explore how these patterns vary by age. Regarding Internet access, results suggest that while the gender divide has reversed in favor of women, older adults who are economically, socioculturally, or physically disadvantaged are less likely to have reliable Internet access. In addition, the view that the various divides in Internet access are less of a concern for those who are younger is only partially supported, as some access-related divides do not vary by age or even decrease with age. For SNS adoption, we found that access to technological resources (diversity of online activities) positively predicts SNS use. Moreover, SNS users are more likely to be younger, female, widowed, and homemakers, perhaps because these individuals are more motivated to use SNSs to complement or compensate for their existing social status. These findings reveal unique challenges and motivations in relation to Internet access and SNS adoption patterns across the later life span.

<title>Short-term and long-term effects of a social network intervention on friendships among university students</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59594-z</url>
<snippet>Informal social relations, such as friendships, are crucial for the well-being and success of students at all levels of education. Network interventions can aim at providing contact opportunities in school settings to prevent the social isolation of individuals and facilitate integration between otherwise segregated social groups. We investigate the short-term and long-term effects of one specific network intervention in an undergraduate cohort freshly admitted to an engineering department (N=226). In this intervention, we randomly assigned students into small groups at an introduction event two months prior to their first day at university. The groups were designed to increase mixed-gender contact opportunities. Two months after the intervention, we find a higher rate of friendships, common friends, and mixed-gender friendships in pairs of students who were assigned to the same group than in pairs from different groups (short-term effects). These effects gradually diminish over the first academic year (long-term effects). Using stochastic actor-oriented models, we investigate the long-term trajectory of the intervention effects, while considering alternative network processes, such as reciprocity, transitivity, homophily, and popularity. The results suggest that even though the induced friendship ties are less stable than other friendships, they may serve as early seeds for complex social network processes. Our study shows that simple network interventions can have a pronounced short-term effect and indirect long-term effects on the evolution and structure of student communities.

<title>A network centrality bias: Central individuals in workplace networks have more supportive coworkers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.12.002</url>
<snippet>Combining the results of two empirical studies, we investigate the role of alters' motivation in explaining change in ego's network position over time. People high in communal motives, who are prone to supportive and altruistic behavior in their interactions with others as a way to gain social acceptance, prefer to establish ties with co-workers occupying central positions in organizational social networks. This effect results in a systematic network centrality bias: The personal network of central individuals (individuals with many incoming ties from colleagues) is more likely to contain more supportive and altruistic people than the personal network of in-dividuals who are less central (individuals with fewer incoming ties). This result opens the door to the possibility that the effects of centrality so frequently documented in empirical studies may be due, at least in part, to characteristics of the alters in an ego's personal community, rather than to egos themselves. Our findings invite further empirical research on how alters' motives affect the returns that people can reap from their personal networks in organizations.

<title>Homophily and the Speed of Social Mobilization: The Effect of Acquired and Ascribed Traits</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095140</url>
<snippet>Large-scale mobilization of individuals across social networks is becoming increasingly prevalent in society. However, little is known about what affects the speed of social mobilization. Here we use a framed field experiment to identify and measure properties of individuals and their relationships that predict mobilization speed. We ran a global social mobilization contest and recorded personal traits of the participants and those they recruited. We studied the effects of ascribed traits (gender, age) and acquired traits (geography, and information source) on the speed of mobilization. We found that homophily, a preference for interacting with other individuals with similar traits, had a mixed role in social mobilization. Homophily was present for acquired traits, in which mobilization speed was faster when the recuiter and recruit had the same trait compared to different traits. In contrast, we did not find support for homophily for the ascribed traits. Instead, those traits had other, non-homophily effects: Females mobilized other females faster than males mobilized other males. Younger recruiters mobilized others faster, and older recruits mobilized slower. Recruits also mobilized faster when they first heard about the contest directly from the contest organization, and decreased in speed when hearing from less personal source types (e. g. family vs. media). These findings show that social mobilization includes dynamics that are unlike other, more passive forms of social activity propagation. These findings suggest relevant factors for engineering social mobilization tasks for increased speed.

<title>Women behaving badly: negative posts on Facebook memorial pages</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1257040</url>
<snippet>This study explores negative posts in Facebook pages dedicated to dead subjects. As with places for mourning in offline environments, memorial pages in Facebook appear to exude a sacred character as objects to both celebrate the life of the deceased and grieve their departure with others. Through a two-step content analysis of an initial sample of 600 pages containing the R.I.P.' acronym in their title, we found, however, a number of posts violating conventional expectations of respect for these mourning spaces. Negative posts in memorial pages take the form of flames (i.e., insults directed at the subject of the page, its administrator, or other visitors), venting (e.g., violent language against the victimizers of the subject of a memorial page), or spam' (i.e., advertisement and content not related to the subject and purpose of the page). Moreover, while results show that most memorial pages in Facebook are created and maintained by women (even thought the subject in the majority of those pages are young males who died an untimely death), they also reveal that women post the majority of negative posts in those pages as well. In other words, whereas women seem to perpetuate traditional offline roles in connection to mourning and grieving rituals, in the online world, they are also the first ones challenging the socially sanctioned sacral attributes of those practices in social networking sites.

<title>The formation of political discussion networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211609</url>
<snippet>Dialogues among politicians provide a window into political landscapes and relations among parties and nations. Existing research has focused on the outcomes of such dialogues and on the structure of social networks on which they take place. Little is known, however, about how political discussion networks form and which are the main driving forces behind their formation. We study a collection of ego-networks from 30 randomly sampled Romanian politicians to reveal fundamental processes behind the formation of political discussion networks. We show that ties in such networks tend to be strong and balanced, and that their organization is not affected by sex, age or education homophily. We use the exponential family of random graph models for small networks to assess likely closure mechanisms and possible homophily effects, but we note that further research and additional data are needed to fully understand the impact of context and political affiliations on the generalization of our findings.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764214527092</url>
<snippet>Social media communication is characterized by reduced anonymity and off-to-online social interactions. These characteristics require scholars to revisit social influence mechanisms online. The current study builds on social influence literature to explore social network and gender effects on online behavior. Findings from a quasi-experiment suggest that both network-related variables and gender are significantly associated with online behavior. Perceived social environment, measured by personal network exposure rate, is more significant than objective reality, measured by frequency of received social messages, in determining behavior. We discuss the implications of social contagion effects on web-based strategic communication-including advertising, political campaigns, and social mobilization. Data limitations and the difficulty of measuring social network influence via social media are also discussed.

<title>Responsiveness of Mining Community Acceptance Model to Key Parameter Changes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3458</url>
<snippet>The mining industry has difficulties predicting changes in the level of community acceptance of its projects over time. These changes are due to changes in the society and individual perceptions around these mines as a result of the mines' environmental and social impacts. Agent-based modeling can be used to facilitate better understanding of how community acceptance changes with changing mine environmental impacts. This work investigates the sensitivity of an agent-based model (ABM) for predicting changes in community acceptance of a mining project due to information diffusion to key input parameters. Specifically, this study investigates the responsiveness of the ABM to average degree (total number of friends) of the social network, close neighbour ratio (a measure of homophily in the social network) and number of early adopters ("innovators"). A two-level full factorial experiment was used to investigate the sensitivity of the model to these parameters. The primary (main), secondary and tertiary effects of each parameter were estimated to assess the model's sensitivity. The results show that the model is more responsive to close neighbour ratio and number of early adopters than average degree. Consequently, uncertainty surrounding the inferences drawn from simulation experiments using the agent-based model will be minimized by obtaining more reliable estimates of close neighbour ratio and number of early adopters. While it is possible to reliably estimate the level of early adopters from the literature, the degree of homophily (close neighbour ratio) has to be estimated from surveys that can be expensive and unreliable. Further, work is required to find economic ways to document relevant degrees of homophily in social networks in mining communities.

<title>Robustness and rich clubs in collaborative learning groups: a learning analytics study using network science</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71483-z</url>
<snippet>Productive and effective collaborative learning is rarely a spontaneous phenomenon but rather the result of meeting a set of conditions, orchestrating and scaffolding productive interactions. Several studies have demonstrated that conflicts can have detrimental effects on student collaboration. Through the application of network science, and social network analysis in particular, this learning analytics study investigates the concept of group robustness; that is, the capacity of collaborative groups to remain functional despite the withdrawal or absence of group members, and its relation to group performance in the frame of collaborative learning. Data on all student and teacher interactions were collected from two phases of a course in medical education that employed an online learning environment. Visual and mathematical analysis were conducted, simulating the removal of actors and its effect on the group's robustness and network structure. In addition, the extracted network parameters were used as features in machine learning algorithms to predict student performance. The study contributes findings that demonstrate the use of network science to shed light on essential elements of collaborative learning and demonstrates how the concept and measures of group robustness can increase understanding of the conditions of productive collaborative learning. It also contributes to understanding how certain interaction patterns can help to promote the sustainability or robustness of groups, while other interaction patterns can make the group more vulnerable to withdrawal and dysfunction. The finding also indicate that teachers can be a driving factor behind the formation of rich clubs of well-connected few and less connected many in some cases and can contribute to a more collaborative and sustainable process where every student is included.Y

<title>Academic performance and behavioral patterns</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0138-8</url>
<snippet>Identifying the factors that influence academic performance is an essential part of educational research. Previous studies have documented the importance of personality traits, class attendance, and social network structure. Because most of these analyses were based on a single behavioral aspect and/or small sample sizes, there is currently no quantification of the interplay of these factors. Here, we study the academic performance among a cohort of 538 undergraduate students forming a single, densely connected social network. Our work is based on data collected using smartphones, which the students used as their primary phones for two years. The availability of multi-channel data from a single population allows us to directly compare the explanatory power of individual and social characteristics. We find that the most informative indicators of performance are based on social ties and that network indicators result in better model performance than individual characteristics (including both personality and class attendance). We confirm earlier findings that class attendance is the most important predictor among individual characteristics. Finally, our results suggest the presence of strong homophily and/or peer effects among university students.

<title>Structural Inequities and Social Networks Impact Hormone Use and Misuse Among Transgender Women in Los Angeles County</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-017-1143-x</url>
<snippet>In order to reduce gender dysphoria and combat stigma, transgender women often affirm their gender through social and medical transition, which may include cross-sex hormone therapy. This study examined associations between medically monitored hormone use and hormone misuse (non-prescribed hormone use including "fillers"), structural inequities (access to housing, health insurance, and income), and social network dynamics among 271 transgender women in Los Angeles. Hormone use status was coded trichotomously (hormone use, hormone misuse, no hormone use), and robust multinomial logistic regression as well as novel social network analysis was conducted to examine associations. Results demonstrated that younger, African-American/Black transgender women were most likely to engage in hormone misuse compared to transgender women who were older or non-African-American/Black. One-third of the sample reported sex work as a main source of income, and this group was more likely to misuse hormones than those with another primary source of income. Transgender women with access to stable housing and health insurance were most likely to engage in medically monitored hormone use. Social network analysis revealed that transgender women with a greater number of hormone-using network alters were most likely to misuse hormones, but that using the Internet to find transgender friends mitigated this association. Results demonstrate the multifaceted risk profile of transgender women who use and misuse hormones, including that social networks play an important role in hormone usage among transgender women.

<title>Exploring Within-Gender Differences in Friendships Using an Online Social Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-024-02906-5</url>
<snippet>People tend to befriend others similar to themselves, generating a pattern called homophily. However, existing studies on friendship patterns often rely on surveys that assess the perspective of relatively few participants on their friendships but do not measure actualized friendship patterns. Here, we used data from a large Slovakian online social network to assess the role of gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) in same-gender online connections among more than 400,000 users. We found that age and BMI homophily occurred in both men's and women's same-gender connections, but somewhat more strongly among men's. Yet, as women diverged in BMI, their connections were less likely to be reciprocated. We discuss how the evolutionary legacy of men's coalitional competition (e.g., warfare) and women's mating competition or recruitment of allocare providers might contribute to these patterns in modern same-gender relationships. For example, men's engagement in physical activities may lead to similar formidability levels among their same-gender peers. Altogether, our findings highlight the importance of trait similarity to same-gender friendship patterns.

<title>Online Networks and Subjective Well-Being: The Effect of "Big Five Personality Traits"</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/si.v9i4.4507</url>
<snippet>This article provides an empirical examination of how online social networks affect subjective well-being, namely enquiring if networks mediate the effect of personality on subjective well-being of the individuals who use those networks. We use the theories of complementarity of face-to-face and online networks, preferential attachment, and the "Big Five Personality Traits" to test the following hypothesis: Given that online and offline networks complement each other as integrative factors that generate happiness, greater use of online networks would imply greater happiness. We also hypothesize that networks mediate the effect of personality on subjective well-being. Data was compiled from interviews of 4,922 people aged 18 years and older, carried out by the Centre for Sociological Research of Spain in 2014 and 2016. The results confirm the hypothesis and show how online networks, when controlled for personality traits, have a significant and even greater effect on subjective well-being than face-to-face networks.

<title>Computer networks as social networks: Collaborative work, telework, and virtual community</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.213</url>
<snippet>When computer networks link people as well as machines, they become social networks. Such computer-supported social networks (CSSNs) are becoming important bases of virtual communities, computer-supported cooperative work, and telework. Computer-mediated communication such as electronic mail and computerized conferencing is usually text-based and asynchronous. It has limited social presence, and on-line communications are often more uninhibited, creative, and blunt than in-person communication. Nevertheless, CSSNs sustain strong, intermediate, and weak ties that provide information and social support in both specialized and broadly based relationships. CSSNs foster virtual communities that are usually partial and narrowly focused, although some do become encompassing and broadly based. CSSNs accomplish a wide variety of cooperative work, connecting workers within and between organizations who are often physically dispersed. CSSNs also link teleworkers from their homes or remote work centers to main organizational offices. Although many relationships function off-line as well as on-line, CSSNs have developed their own norms and structures. The nature of the medium both constrains and facilitates social control. CSSNs have strong societal implications, fostering situations that combine global connectivity, the fragmentation of solidarities, the de-emphasis of local organizations (in the neighborhood and workplace), and the increased importance of home bases.

<title>Reinforced structural holes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2015.04.008</url>
<snippet>Holes in social structure are variably reinforced by the social organization around the hole. The more reinforced the hole, the greater the difficulty in bridging it, but the more likely a successful bridge will carry information novel, and so potentially valuable, to people on the other side. To study how reinforcement varies with access to structural holes, and the achievement associated with access, I propose a measure of access to reinforced structural holes (RSH), and present results predicting achievement in an integrated banker organization and a balkanized supply-chain organization. In both study populations, the people who have access to structural holes also have access to reinforced structural holes, and all measures of access have a statistically significant association with achievement. However, there is no consistent prediction advantage from incorporating reinforcement in measures of access to structural holes. The reinforced-holes measure predicts compensation better or as well as network constraint and betweenness, but is weaker or no better than a count of nonredundant contacts. I do not infer from the results a rank-order of alternative measures so much as substitutability. I expect achievement to be associated with access to structural holes, but I expect the association to vary across alternative measures depending on how achievement is achieved in a specific population.

<title>User Behavior on Online Social Networks: Relationships among Social Activities and Satisfaction</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12101656</url>
<snippet>Social networking sites (SNSs) are now ubiquitous communities for constant online interpersonal interactions that trigger symmetric or asymmetric effects on our everyday life. Recent studies advocate in favor of the significant role that SNSs have in promoting well-being and, more importantly, in disseminating reliable information during a global crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the growing importance of SNSs to the global framework, the main purpose of this study is to empirically assess the link between the use of symmetric social networks such as Facebook, or asymmetric social networks, like Instagram, and the level of satisfaction, employing the methodology of structural equation modeling. The results of the research validate the hypothesis that SNS activities increase the level of satisfaction, and therefore, that there is a direct link between the number of posts and comments and the level of satisfaction. Furthermore, based on the reversible and significant link between the level of satisfaction and the importance attributed to SNSs, the main conclusion of the study is that the higher the importance of the SNS, the greater the level of dissatisfaction experienced by users. Also, public activities on social networks positively affect social network satisfaction, while private activities have a direct negative relationship with the importance of social networks.

<title>An entropy-based method to control COVID-19 rumors in online social networks using opinion leaders</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.102048</url>
<snippet>-In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, people spread various COVID-19-related rumors and hoaxes that negatively influence human civilization through online social networks (OSN). The proposed research addresses the unique and innovative approach to controlling COVID-19 rumors through the power of opinion leaders (OLs) in OSN. The entire process is partitioned into two phases; the first phase describes the novel Reputation-based Opinion Leader Identification (ROLI) algorithm, including a unique voting method to identify the top-T OLs in the OSN. The second phase describes the technique to measure the aggregated polarity score of each posted tweet/post and compute each user's reputation. The empirical reputation is utilized to calculate the user's trust, the post's entropy, and its veracity. If the experimental entropy of the post is lower than the empirical threshold value, the post is likely to be categorized as a rumor. The proposed approach operated on Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit social networks for validation. The ROLI algorithm provides 91&#37; accuracy, 93&#37; precision, 95&#37; recall, and 94&#37; F1-score over other Social Network Analysis (SNA) measures to find OLs in OSN. Moreover, the proposed approach's rumor controlling effectiveness and efficiency is also estimated based on three standard metrics; affected degree, represser degree, and diffuser degree, and obtained 26&#37;, 22&#37;, and 23&#37; improvement, respectively. The concluding outcomes illustrate that the influence of OLs is exceptionally significant in controlling COVID-19 rumors.

<title>Impact of correcting misinformation on social disruption</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265734</url>
<snippet>People are obtaining more and more information from social media and other online sources, but the spread of misinformation can lead to social disruption. In particular, social networking services (SNSs) can easily spread information of uncertain authenticity and factuality. Although many studies have proposed methods that addressed how to suppress the spread of misinformation on SNSs, few works have examined the impact on society of diffusing both misinformation and its corrective information. This study models the effects of effort to reduce misinformation and the diffusion of corrective information on social disruption, and it clarifies these effects. With the aim of reducing the impact on social disruption, we show that not only misinformation but also corrective information can cause social disruption, and we clarify how to control the spread of the latter to limit its impact. We analyzed the misinformation about a toilet-paper shortage and its correction as well as the social disruption this event caused in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. First, (1) we analyzed the extent to which misinformation and its corrections spread on SNS, and then (2) we created a model to estimate the impact of misinformation and its corrections on the world. Finally, (3) We used our model to analyze the change in this impact when the diffusion of the misinformation and its corrections changed. Based on our analysis results in (1), the corrective information spread much more widely than the misinformation. From the model developed in (2), the corrective information caused excessive purchasing behavior. The analysis results in (3) show that the amount of corrective information required to minimize the societal impact depends on the amount of misinformation diffusion. Most previous studies concentrated on the impact of corrective information on attitudes toward misinformation. On the other hand, the most significant contribution of this study is that it focuses on the impact of corrective information on society and clarifies the appropriate amount of it.

<title>Mean-field theory of social laser</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12327-w</url>
<snippet>In this work we suggest a novel paradigm of social laser (solaser), which can explain such Internet inspired social phenomena as echo chambers, reinforcement and growth of information cascades, enhancement of social actions under strong mass media operation. The solaser is based on a wellknown in quantum physics laser model of coherent amplification of the optical field. Social networks are at the core of the solaser model; we define them by means of a network model possessing power-law degree distribution. In the solaser the network environment plays the same role as the gain medium has in a physical laser device. We consider social atoms as decision making agents (humans or even chat bots), which possess two (mental) states and occupy the nodes of a network. The solaser establishes communication between the agents as absorption and spontaneous or stimulated emission of socially actual information within echo chambers, which mimic an optical resonator of a convenient (physical) laser. We have demonstrated that social lasing represents the second order nonequilibrium phase transition, which evokes the release of coherent socially stimulated information field represented with the order parameter. The solaser implies the formation of macroscopic social polarization and results in a huge social impact, which is realized by viral information cascades occurring in the presence of population imbalance (social bias). We have shown that decision making agents follow an adiabatically time dependent mass media pump, which acts in the network community reproducing various reliable scenarios for information cascade evolution. We have also shown that in contrast to physical lasers, due to node degree peculiarities, the coupling strength of decision making agents with the network may be enhanced root &lt; k &gt; times. It leads to a large increase of speed, at which a viral message spreads through a social media. In this case, the mass media pump supports additional reinforcement and acceleration of cascade growth. We have revealed that the solaser model in some approximations possesses clear links with familiar !sing and SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) models typically used for evaluating a social impact and information growth, respectively. However, the solaser paradigm can serve as a new platform for modelling temporal social events, which originate from "microscopic" (quantum-like) processes occurring in the society. Our findings open new perspectives for interdisciplinary studies of distributed intelligence agents behavior associated with information exchange and social impact.

<title>Women Favour Dyadic Relationships, but Men Prefer Clubs: Cross-Cultural Evidence from Social Networking</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118329</url>
<snippet>The ability to create lasting, trust-based friendships makes it possible for humans to form large and coherent groups. The recent literature on the evolution of sociality and on the network dynamics of human societies suggests that large human groups have a layered structure generated by emotionally supported social relationships. There are also gender differences in adult social style which may involve different trade-offs between the quantity and quality of friendships. Although many have suggested that females tend to focus on intimate relations with a few other females, while males build larger, more hierarchical coalitions, the existence of such gender differences is disputed and data from adults is scarce. Here, we present cross-cultural evidence for gender differences in the preference for close friendships. We use a sample of similar to 112,000 profile pictures from nine world regions posted on a popular social networking site to show that, in self-selected displays of social relationships, women favour dyadic relations, whereas men favour larger, all-male cliques. These apparently different solutions to quality-quantity trade-offs suggest a universal and fundamental difference in the function of close friendships for the two sexes.

<title>Becoming roller derby grrrls: Exploring the gendered play of affect in mediated sport cultures</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1012690212446451</url>
<snippet>This article explores how the global revival of roller derby as an alternative sport for women has been mobilised through online social networks, league promotion and fan sites that create imagined communities of roller grrrls'. In the creation of sport culture we argue that the virtual performance of derby' identities is as significant as the embodiment of play. Like other sports, derby sites mobilise affect (passion, pleasure, pain, desire to play) through a discourse of empowerment' that urges women to overcome limits and reinvent gendered subjectivity. However, within the virtual space of roller derby, complex affects are produced and circulated within power relations that can include or exclude. Through an analysis of the way affect is mobilised in selected roller derby sites, we identify how virtual sport identities are connected through the movement of affects' across bodies and leagues. These affects both circumscribe and undermine the notion of a single derby community.

<snippet>We use Italian data from the Multipurpose Household Survey to explore how participation in social networking sites (SNS) such as Facebook and Twitter affects the most economically relevant aspect of social capital, trust. We account for measures of trust in strangers (often referred to as social trust), trust in neighbours (particularized trust) and trust in the police (institutional trust). We address endogeneity in the use of SNS by exploiting the variation in the availability of broadband for high-speed Internet, which relates to technological characteristics of the pre-existing voice telecommunication infrastructures. We find that all the forms of trust significantly decrease with participation in online networks. We discuss several interpretations of the results in light of the specific features of Internet-mediated social interaction.

<title>Social networks reveal cultural behaviour in tool-using using dolphins</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms1983</url>
<snippet>Animal tool use is of inherent interest given its relationship to intelligence, innovation and cultural behaviour. Here we investigate whether Shark Bay bottlenose dolphins that use marine sponges as hunting tools (spongers) are culturally distinct from other dolphins in the population based on the criteria that sponging is both socially learned and distinguishes between groups. We use social network analysis to determine social preferences among 36 spongers and 69 non-spongers sampled over a 22-year period while controlling for location, sex and matrilineal relatedness. Homophily (the tendency to associate with similar others) based on tool-using status was evident in every analysis, although maternal kinship, sex and location also contributed to social preference. Female spongers were more cliquish and preferentially associated with other spongers over non-spongers. Like humans who preferentially associate with others who share their subculture, tool-using dolphins prefer others like themselves, strongly suggesting that sponge tool-use is a cultural behaviour.

<title>Network Position and Crowdsourcing Innovation Contribution Behavior: The Moderating Role of Knowledge Absorption Capacity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/9969509</url>
<snippet>Purpose. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between network position and crowdsourcing innovation contribution behavior and the moderating effects of knowledge absorption capacity on the aforementioned relationship. Design/Methodology/Approach. Focusing on the Chinese context, the study conducts empirical research with the user's knowledge-sharing network of the MIUI community to test the research model. The negative binomial regression model which is suitable for processing discrete data is used to examine the main effects of the network position, knowledge absorption capacity, and crowdsourcing innovation contribution behavior. Findings. The findings reveal that the closer the user gets to the center of the network, the more likely they will contribute. The users' knowledge absorption capacity can help stimulate the users' crowdsourcing innovation contribution behavior, and the users with stronger knowledge absorption capacity are more likely to transform their network position advantages into innovative contribution behaviors. Practical Implications. The study provides evidence that network position has a positive impact on their crowdsourcing innovation contribution behavior, and knowledge absorption capacity promotes the crowdsourcing innovation behavior of users. Managers should encourage users to occupy a favorable network position and increase knowledge exchange with other users, while at the same time continuously improving their own knowledge absorption capacity. Originality/Value. This study combines social network theory and the individual mindset to introduce knowledge absorptive capacity into the relationship model of the user's network position and crowdsourcing innovation contribution behavior, thereby constructing a complete path of "knowledge supply-knowledge acquisition-knowledge application-knowledge output." The study contributes to provide a theoretical basis for an in-depth understanding of the influence relationship between network position and crowdsourcing innovation contribution behavior. Also, it provides a reference for enterprises to carry out practical crowdsourcing innovation community governance and improve innovation performance.

<title>Untangling the team social capital-team innovation link: The role of proportional task conflict as well as group- and differentiated individual-focused transformational leadership</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00187267221080995</url>
<snippet>Findings from prior research on the relationship between a team's social network architecture and team innovation have been inconclusive. Integrating social network theory with input-process-output models of team innovation, our research aims to reconcile the mixed findings in the literature by introducing a novel process perspective as well as highlighting a relevant contingency factor to untangle the team social capital-team innovation link. We propose that team social capital, operationalized as bridging and bonding social capital, negatively influences team innovation via team proportional task conflict, which is the level of task conflict teams experience proportional to the general level of team conflict (i.e. task, relationship and process conflict). In addition, we expected group and differentiated individual-focused transformational leadership to buffer the negative indirect effect of team social capital on team innovation via team proportional task conflict. Results from time-lagged data collected from research and development teams in Iraq revealed that teams with bonding and bridging social capital are less innovative because they experience less proportional task conflict. Furthermore, group-focused transformational leadership buffered the negative indirect relationship of team bridging social capital on team innovation via proportional task conflict. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

<snippet>Social network analysis, now often thought of simply as network science, has penetrated nearly every scientific and many scholarly fields and has become an indispensable resource. Yet, social networks are special by virtue of being specifically social, and our growing understanding of the brain is affecting our understanding of how social networks form, mature, and are exploited by their members. We discuss the expanding research on how the brain manages social information, how this information is heuristically processed, and how network cognitions are affected by situation and circumstance. In the process, we argue that the cognitive turn in social networks exemplifies the modern conception of the brain as fundamentally reprogrammable by experience and circumstance. Far from social networks being dependent upon the brain, we anticipate a modern view in which cognition and social networks coconstitute each other.

<title>When is brokerage negatively associated with economic benefits? Ethnic diversity, competition, and common-pool resources</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2015.11.004</url>
<snippet>There is a growing body of literature positively linking dimensions of social capital to economic benefits. Yet recent research also points to a potential "dark side" of social capital, where over-embeddedness in networks and the pressures associated with brokerage are hypothesized to constrain actors, having a negative effect on economic outcomes. This dichotomy suggests that context is important, yet the overwhelming majority of existing empirical evidence stems from socially homogenous populations in corporate and organizational settings, limiting a broader understanding of when and how context matters. We advance this discourse to a socially fragmented, ethnically diverse common-pool resource system where information is highly valuable and competition is fierce. Merging several unique datasets from Hawaii's pelagic tuna fishery, we find that network prominence, i.e., being well connected locally, has a significant, positive effect on economic productivity. In contrast, we find that brokerage, defined here as ties that bridge either structurally distinct or ethnically distinct groups, has a significant, negative effect. Taken together, our results provide empirical support to widespread claims of the value of information access in common-pool resource systems, yet suggest that in ethnically diverse, competitive environments, brokers may be penalized for sharing information across social divides. Our results thus contribute to an emerging theory on the fragile nature of brokerage that recognizes its potential perils and the importance of context. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Making "Friends" in a Virtual World: The Role of Preferential Attachment, Homophily, and Status</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439315605476</url>
<snippet>Graphical virtual worlds add two new layers to the old question what determines friendship formation. First, it is possible to distinguish between off-line (player) and online (avatar) characteristics. Second, these environments offer new possibilities for studying friendship formation. By tracking friendship requests and their acceptance rate, researchers are able to distinguish between with whom players want to become friends and with whom they actually do become friends. This article examined friendship formation in Timik, a graphical virtual world targeted at Polish teenagers. Homophily, preferential attachment and status were tested as possible underlying mechanisms. Results showed that preferential attachment and status drove invitations: Players wanted to become friends with high-status players. However, high-status players were also more likely to reject offers. Homophily only played a minor role. Players preferred players of the same avatar class and similar age but of the opposite sex. Too similar avatars were disliked. The results are discussed in the light of the generalizability of off-line theories of friendship formation to online worlds.

<snippet>This paper examines the role of gender in the formation of research collaboration networks, by investigating the composition of networks through connections to diverse professional communities. Drawing on an ego network approach, we examine gender differences among researchers' networks in terms of partner diversity, openness and brokerage roles. We use data from 897 valid responses to a questionnaire administered to biomedical scientists in Spain, which enquired into multiple aspects of personal research networks. Our findings show that women form more diverse networks and brokerage triads than men. This result is reinforced if we consider the most heterogeneous brokerage triads in terms of professional differences among network partners (i.e., consultant and liaison). Our results suggest that women are more likely to access non-redundant knowledge and richer research perspectives via their knowledge-flow intermediary roles. This research suggests the need for analyses of gender and networks that go beyond a gender-to-gender approach.

<title>Towards hypermedia campaigning? Perceptions of new media's importance for campaigning by party strategists in comparative perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2014.993679</url>
<snippet>This paper analyses strategic thinking around election campaign communication in a rapidly evolving media environment, characterized by the rise of digital communication channels and online social networks as new tools of political campaigning. Using an expert survey with campaign managers of 68 political parties within 12 European nations, representing both old and new EU member states, the study investigates the perceived importance of different types of communication platforms in meeting campaign objectives, especially with regard to differences between new and direct modes of campaigning in comparison to traditional campaign channels. The attributed significance to these various channels is then analysed against a range of variables on macro (country) level as well as meso (party) level. The results suggest that while some differences can be observed in regard to the perceptions of particular types of social media between individual strategists working for parties as well as between strategists working in new and old EU member states (e.g. Facebook is seen as more important in younger democracies), overall we can see a relatively high level of homogeneity in the perceived importance of campaign communication in the sample. The data point to the embedding of new communication platforms within election campaign strategies across most nations and parties; this indicates that the move towards 'hypermedia' campaign style, integrating both old and new campaign tools and communication platforms, is now becoming a standard feature of professional campaigning strategy in Europe.

<title>Friendship Network and Dental Brushing Behavior among Middle School Students: An Agent Based Modeling Approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169236</url>
<snippet>By using a standard questionnaire, the level of dental brushing frequency was assessed among 201 adolescent female middle school students in Tehran. The initial assessment was repeated after 5 months, in order to observe the dynamics in dental health behavior level. Logistic Regression model was used to evaluate the correlation among individuals' dental health behavior in their social network. A significant correlation on dental brushing habits was detected among groups of friends. This correlation was further spread over the network within the 5 months period. Moreover, it was identified that the average brushing level was improved within the 5 months period. Given that there was a significant correlation between social network's nodes' in-degree value, and brushing level, it was suggested that the observed improvement was partially due to more popularity of individuals with better tooth brushing habit. Agent Based Modeling (ABM) was used to demonstrate the dynamics of dental brushing frequency within a sample of friendship network. Two models with static and dynamic assumptions for the network structure were proposed. The model with dynamic network structure successfully described the dynamics of dental health behavior. Based on this model, on average, every 43 weeks a student changes her brushing habit due to learning from her friends. Finally, three training scenarios were tested by these models in order to evaluate their effectiveness. When training more popular students, considerable improvement in total students' brushing frequency was demonstrated by simulation results.

<title>Spread of gambling abstinence through peers and comments in online self-help chat forums to quit gambling</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-07714-2</url>
<snippet>Habit formation occurs in relation to peer habits and comments. This general principle was applied to gambling abstinence in the context of online self-help forums to quit gambling. Participants in this study, conducted between September 2008 and March 2020, were 161 abstinent and 928 non-abstinent gamblers who participated in online self-help chat forums to quit gambling. They received 269,317 comments during their first 3 years of forum participation. Gamblers had an increased likelihood of 3-year continuous gambling abstinence if they had many peers in the forums. However, they had a decreased likelihood of gambling abstinence if they received rejective comments from the forums. Based on these results, online social network-based interventions may be a new treatment option for gamblers.

<title>Susceptibility to social influence predicts behavior on Facebook</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229337</url>
<snippet>Susceptibility to social influence (SSI) has been reported as a key factor for social influence in online social networks (OSNs) such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. In four online studies, we show that the personality trait of SSI, namely the susceptibility to normative influence (SNI), predicts the extent to which Facebook users comply with the behavior of others on Facebook (e.g., buying, voting, or visiting what other OSN users post). In Studies 1a and 1b, we find that SSI correlates with diverse OSN behaviors, which are the typical results of being affected by social influence. In Study 1b, we find that the perceived importance of the topic of OSN behaviors (e.g., fashion or politics) moderates the effect of SNI on OSN behavior, with a higher importance resulting in a stronger effect of SNI on OSN behavior. In Studies 2 and 3, we find that SNI predicts the extent Facebook users hypothetically "like" diverse topics on Facebook. We also find partial support for the idea that there are interactions between SNI and the Big Five personality traits (i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) on OSN behavior. Specifically, the extent to which the Big Five personality traits of openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism predict OSN behavior depends on Facebook users' SNI. Our studies contribute to research on the personality-based prediction of OSN behavior and help in better understanding the dynamics of social influence in OSNs, underlining the vulnerability of susceptible OSN users.

<title>A Qualitative Study to Examine Feasibility and Design of an Online Social Networking Intervention to Increase Physical Activity in Teenage Girls</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0150817</url>
<snippet>Background Online social networks present wide-reaching and flexible platforms through which to deliver health interventions to targeted populations. This study used a social marketing approach to explore teenage girls' perceptions of physical activity and the potential use of online social networks to receive a physical activity intervention. Methods Six focus groups were conducted with 19 Australian teenage girls (ages 13 to 18 years) with varying levels of physical activity and socioeconomic status. A semi-structured format was used, with groups discussion transcribed verbatim. Content analysis identified emergent themes, with triangulation and memos used to ensure accuracy. Results Physical activity was most appealing when it emphasised sport, exercise and fitness, along with opportunities for socialisation with friends and self-improvement. Participants were receptive to delivery of a physical activity intervention via online social networks, with Facebook the most widely reported site. Participants commonly accessed online social networks via mobile devices and particularly smartphones. Undesirable features included promotion of physical activity in terms of walking; use of cartoon imagery; use of humour; and promotion of the intervention via schools, each of which were considered "uncool". Participants noted that their parents were likely to be supportive of them using an online social networking physical activity intervention, particularly if not promoted as a weight loss intervention. Conclusion This study identified key features likely to increase the feasibility and retention of an online social networking physical activity intervention for teenage girls. Guidelines for the design of interventions for teenage girls are provided for future applications.

<title>Finding Teens in TheirSpace: Using Social Networking Sites to Connect Youth to Sexual Health Services</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13178-011-0043-4</url>
<snippet>The increasing popularity and widespread use of the Internet has made it an emerging venue for delivering health-related messages and interventions. The current study explored the potential for using social networking sites (SNS), specifically MySpace, to connect youth to sexual health services. Surveys and focus groups with youth aged 14-19 living in low-income communities in California revealed high levels of overall Internet access, frequent use of SNS, and experience in searching for health information online. However, disparities in frequency and location of Internet access by race/ethnicity, and hesitancy among some youth to join a clinic's online social network, may affect the success of this new strategy in some populations. Interviews with clinic staff highlighted the successes and challenges of using MySpace as part of their outreach efforts. Staff described balancing the benefits of web-based outreach, including its low cost, wide reach, and teen friendliness, with its challenges, including overcoming technological barriers, ensuring teens' safety from inappropriate contact, and remaining timely and relevant given the dynamic nature of the Internet. This study indicates that SNS and other technologies have strong potential for reaching diverse youth with critical health information when implemented as part of a comprehensive outreach strategy.

<title>Citizen-Driven International Networks and Globalization of Social Movements on Twitter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439315617263</url>
<snippet>Social media offer an avenue for the formation of citizen-driven global networks that are vital to mobilizing international support and curating global public discourse in social movements. This study looks into the global flow of information and communication about Hong Kong's Occupy Central Movement with a focus on the country/territory-level international network that emerged on Twitter. Drawing on the world systems theory and the literature on social movement, it examines whether the globalization of a local social movement via social media is circumscribed by the existing order of the world system (i.e., from the developed core countries/territories to the developing peripheral). It focuses its analysis on the network structure and the predictors of countries/territories' centrality in the network. Findings of the social network analysis show that the structure of the international network still follows the existing order of the world system to a large extent. It is further supported by the result of the multivariate analysis that national income, a widely used benchmark for determining a country/territory's position in the world economy, is significantly and substantially related to centrality. However, national income does not have the largest predicting power. Instead, a country/territory's level of political grievances is found to be the strongest predictor. In addition, countries/territories with high Internet penetration rates tend to have high-centrality scores, and yet the effect size is smaller than the other predictors.

<title>Identities in flux: Cognitive network activation in times of change</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.01.001</url>
<snippet>Using a dynamic cognitive model, we experimentally test two competing hypotheses that link identity and cognitive network activation during times of change. On one hand, affirming people's sense of power might give them confidence to think beyond the densest subsections of their social networks. Alternatively, if such power affirmations conflict with people's more stable status characteristics, this could create tension, deterring people from considering their networks' diversity. We test these competing hypotheses experimentally by priming people at varying levels of status with power (high/low) and asking them to report their social networks. We show that confirming identity-not affirming power-cognitively prepares people to broaden their social networks when the world is changing around them. The emotional signature of having a confirmed identity is feeling comfortable and in control, which mediates network activation. We suggest that stable, confirmed identities are the foundation from which people can exhibit greater network responsiveness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<title>Real-time Twitter interactions during World Breastfeeding Week: A case study and social network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249302</url>
<snippet>Using Twitter to implement public health awareness campaigns is on the rise, but campaign monitoring and evaluation are largely dependent on basic Twitter Analytics. To establish the potential of social network theory-based metrics in better understanding public health campaigns, we analyzed real-time user interactions on Twitter during the 2020 World Breastfeeding Week (WBW) as an exemplar case. Social network analysis (SNA), including community and influencer identification, as well as topic modeling were used to compare the activity of n = 29,958 campaign participants and n = 10,694 reference users from the six-months pre-campaign period. Users formed more inter-connected relationships during the campaign, retweeting and mentioning each other 46,161 times compared to 10,662 times in the prior six months. Campaign participants formed identifiable communities that were not only based on their geolocation, but also based on interests and professional background. While influencers who dominated the WBW conversations were disproportionally members of the scientific community, the campaign did mobilize influencers from the general public who seemed to play a "bridging" role between the public and the scientific community. Users communicated about the campaign beyond its original themes to also discuss breastfeeding within the context of social and racial inequities. Applying SNA allowed understanding of the breastfeeding campaign's messaging and engagement dynamics across communities and influencers. Moving forward, WBW could benefit from improving targeting to enhance geographic coverage and user interactions. As this exemplar case indicates, social network theory and analysis can be used to inform other public health campaigns with data on user interactions that go beyond traditional metrics.

<title>Do online social media cut through the constraints that limit the size of offline social networks?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.150292</url>
<snippet>The social brain hypothesis has suggested that natural social network sizes may have a characteristic size in humans. This is determined in part by cognitive constraints and in part by the time costs of servicing relationships. Online social networking offers the potential to break through the glass ceiling imposed by at least the second of these, potentially enabling us to maintain much larger social networks. This is tested using two separate UK surveys, each randomly stratified by age, gender and regional population size. The data show that the size and range of online egocentric social networks, indexed as the number of Facebook friends, is similar to that of offline face-to-face networks. For one sample, respondents also specified the number of individuals in the inner layers of their network (formally identified as support clique and sympathy group), and these were also similar in size to those observed in offline networks. This suggests that, as originally proposed by the social brain hypothesis, there is a cognitive constraint on the size of social networks that even the communication advantages of onlinemedia are unable to overcome. In practical terms, it may reflect the fact that real (as opposed to casual) relationships require at least occasional face-to-face interaction to maintain them.

<title>Diffusion Dynamics of Energy Saving Practices in Large Heterogeneous Online Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164476</url>
<snippet>Online social networks are today's fastest growing communications channel and a popular source of information for many, so understanding their contribution to building awareness and shaping public perceptions of climate change is of utmost importance. Today's online social networks are composed of complex combinations of entities and communication channels and it is not clear which communicators are the most influential, what the patterns of communication flow are, or even whether the widely accepted two-step flow of communication model applies in this new arena. This study examines the diffusion of energy saving practices in a large online social network across organizations, opinion leaders, and the public by tracking 108,771 communications on energy saving practices among 1,084 communicators, then analyzing the flow of information and influence over a 28 day period. Our findings suggest that diffusion networks of messages advocating energy saving practices are predominantly led by the activities of dedicated organizations but their attempts do not result in substantial public awareness, as most of these communications are effectively trapped in organizational loops in which messages are simply shared between organizations. Despite their comparably significant influential values, opinion leaders played a weak role in diffusing energy saving practices to a wider audience. Thus, the two-step flow of communication model does not appear to describe the sharing of energy conservation practices in large online heterogeneous networks. These results shed new light on the underlying mechanisms driving the diffusion of important societal issues such as energy efficiency, particularly in the context of large online social media outlets.

<snippet>The use of Twitter by politicians, parties, and the general audience in politics, particularly during election campaigns, has become an extremely popular research field almost overnight. Even though Twitter, a medium that emerged early in 2006 - the first tweet was posted on 21 March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter - and elections occurring only every few years, it has already received much academic attention. The studies produced are very diverse, ranging from analyzing how politicians or citizens use Twitter, to looking at their activities and the content of political Twitter messages, to network studies of Twitter users. This review will cover many types of studies that characterize the field. The large diversity in the studies conducted on elections will be represented in this review of approaches.

<title>From Natural Variation to Optimal Policy? The Importance of Endogenous Peer Group Formation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA10168</url>
<snippet>We take cohorts of entering freshmen at the United States Air Force Academy and assign half to peer groups designed to maximize the academic performance of the lowest ability students. Our assignment algorithm uses nonlinear peer effects estimates from the historical pre-treatment data, in which students were randomly assigned to peer groups. We find a negative and significant treatment effect for the students we intended to help. We provide evidence that within our optimally designed peer groups, students avoided the peers with whom we intended them to interact and instead formed more homogeneous subgroups. These results illustrate how policies that manipulate peer groups for a desired social outcome can be confounded by changes in the endogenous patterns of social interactions within the group.

<title>Information gerrymandering and undemocratic decisions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1507-6</url>
<snippet>People must integrate disparate sources of information when making decisions, especially in social contexts. But information does not always flow freely. It can be constrained by social networks(1-3) and distorted by zealots and automated bots(4). Here we develop a voter game as a model system to study information flow in collective decisions. Players are assigned to competing groups (parties) and placed on an 'influence network' that determines whose voting intentions each player can observe. Players are incentivized to vote according to partisan interest, but also to coordinate their vote with the entire group. Our mathematical analysis uncovers a phenomenon that we call information gerrymandering: the structure of the influence network can sway the vote outcome towards one party, even when both parties have equal sizes and each player has the same influence. A small number of zealots, when strategically placed on the influence network, can also induce information gerrymandering and thereby bias vote outcomes. We confirm the predicted effects of information gerrymandering in social network experiments with n = 2,520 human subjects. Furthermore, we identify extensive information gerrymandering in real-world influence networks, including online political discussions leading up to the US federal elections, and in historical patterns of bill co-sponsorship in the US Congress and European legislatures. Our analysis provides an account of the vulnerabilities of collective decision-making to systematic distortion by restricted information flow. Our analysis also highlights a group-level social dilemma: information gerrymandering can enable one party to sway decisions in its favour, but when multiple parties engage in gerrymandering the group loses its ability to reach consensus and remains trapped in deadlock.

<title>An Urban Network Study of Government Procurement Activities: A Case Study of Northeast China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/8819441</url>
<snippet>Urban networks have been widely examined using infrastructure connection and firm connection data. In particular, urban networks constructed based on firm connection data have been used to depict the circulation of capital, information, personnel, and products between cities. Existing studies on firm connection networks rely on either inter- or intrafirm relationships. However, there exist various important extra-firm relationships, such as those between firms and governments, research institutions, and nonprofit organizations. This study innovatively incorporates the extra-firm relationships between governments and firms into urban network construction to provide new insights into the field of urban network research. Using Northeast China as a case study, we construct government procurement activity (GPA) connection networks for both central projects and local projects at the regional and national scales. Social network analysis and regression analysis are used to analyze the network characteristics and factors associated with the network structure. The results show that three provincial capitals (Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang) hold dominant positions across all the networks. While these capitals serve as GPA suppliers in the region, they are mainly GPA consumers nationally. The factors of spatial proximity, economic development, population, and provincial boundaries were found to be significantly associated with GPA connections. Our study provides important insights into the role of cities in firm-government supply-demand networks. This research can be used to help formulate effective strategies to improve a city's competitiveness and cities' cooperation in the GPA supply-demand network.

<title>Product information diffusion model and reasoning process in consumer behavior</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05636</url>
<snippet>Information diffusion on social media has become a major approach in people's daily communication, and the value contained therein holds great interest for both academic and industrial communities. However, the process of information diffusion is affected by many factors, and the complexity of that process has not been fully explored. Most previous studies have concentrated on the strategies and driving forces in social media operations, as well as the identification of influential seed nodes, yet analyses of consumer behavior choice in the process of information diffusion are rare. Thus, This study proposes a multipoint cross-diffusion model based on Map Reduce, which improves the single-point model and can better describe the product information diffusion process. On that basis, a Bayesian network model of product information diffusion was constructed to analyze the associations between factors and consumer behaviors. Moreover, the posterior probability of consumer behavior choice affected by a series of factors in the information forwarding process was considered and analyzed. This study's findings can be used to estimate the posterior probability that users will purchase, forward, or stay silent, thereby predicting the effect of product diffusion and obtaining the quantitative relationships between factors and consumer behavior.

<snippet>Personality traits are important factors in determining online behaviors. Especially personality traits are linked with users' behavior on Facebook. Despite the substantial quantity of studies conducted on the relationship between personality factors and Facebook addiction, researchers have yet to reach an agreement. This study sought to examine the relationship between personality traits and Facebook addiction. In this meta-analysis study, agreeableness, openness to experience and conscientiousness were negatively related to Facebook addiction. Loneliness, narcissism, impulsivity and shyness were significantly correlated with Facebook addiction. Meta analysis also found that geographical location, personality scales, Facebook addiction scales, publication status moderated the link between personality variables and Facebook addiction. The limitations and future directions are discussed.

<snippet>Models of social networks depict individuals' dependency. They offer a systematic way to capture the connectedness and opinion formations in the complex web of interpersonal influences. This paper studies price stability of a capital market, where the dynamics of participants' opinion formations is formalized using social network models. Stability condition is derived. It is also identified how network structures are important in communications and in determining market stability. it is found that factors or highly-connected networks and balanced weight allocation on information sources can in fact be stabilizing. In applications, this study supports the view that the key to reduce the volatility behaviour of emerging-market securities lies in the development of an efficient investor base. It is suggested that one way to achieve this is by broadening and diversifying both the international and domestic investor categories for the underlying market. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

<title>The effect of individual variation on the structure and function of interaction networks in harvester ants</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2011.0059</url>
<snippet>Social insects exhibit coordinated behaviour without central control. Local interactions among individuals determine their behaviour and regulate the activity of the colony. Harvester ants are recruited for outside work, using networks of brief antennal contacts, in the nest chamber closest to the nest exit: the entrance chamber. Here, we combine empirical observations, image analysis and computer simulations to investigate the structure and function of the interaction network in the entrance chamber. Ant interactions were distributed heterogeneously in the chamber, with an interaction hot-spot at the entrance leading further into the nest. The distribution of the total interactions per ant followed a right-skewed distribution, indicating the presence of highly connected individuals. Numbers of ant encounters observed positively correlated with the duration of observation. Individuals varied in interaction frequency, even after accounting for the duration of observation. An ant's interaction frequency was explained by its path shape and location within the entrance chamber. Computer simulations demonstrate that variation among individuals in connectivity accelerates information flow to an extent equivalent to an increase in the total number of interactions. Individual variation in connectivity, arising from variation among ants in location and spatial behaviour, creates interaction centres, which may expedite information flow.

<title>Impact of methods for reducing respondent burden on personal network structural measures</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2006.12.005</url>
<snippet>We examine methods for reducing respondent burden in evaluating alter-alter ties on a set of network structural measures. The data consist of two sets, each containing 45 alters from respondent free lists: the first contains 447 personal networks, and the second 554. Respondents evaluated the communication between 990 alter pairs. The methods were (1) dropping alters from the end of the free-list, (2) randomly dropping alters, (3) randomly dropping links, and (4) predicting ties based on transitivity. For some measures network structure is captured with samples of less than 20 alters; other measures are less consistent. Researchers should be aware of the need to sample a minimum number of alters to capture structural variation.

<title>Unspeaking on Facebook? Testing network effects on self-censorship of political expressions in social network sites</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-014-0078-8</url>
<snippet>The aim of this study is to explore online social network exposure effects on predicting individual's willingness to self-censor political expression (WTSC) and political posting behaviors. The spiral of silence (SOS) theory is applied to the context of online social networks wherein three major network characteristics are highlighted: reduced privacy, integration of multiple social context/relationships, and increase in unanticipated exposure to different opinions. The discussion leads us to propose three possible network effects in terms of WTSC and posting behavior including 'relationship-specific fear of isolation', 'incongruence with dominant political orientation', and 'exposure to diverse opinions'. Results show that the exposure to diverse opinions is positively associated with WTSC, which in turn is associated with political posting behavior online. Interestingly, while fear of isolation from offline contacts increases WTSC, it has a positive association with actual posting behavior. We speculate to what extent the social conformity proposition of the SOS theory should persist online and call for further exploration of informational nfluence as conceptually distinct from normative influence.

<title>The Social Origins of Networks and Diffusion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/681275</url>
<snippet>Recent research on social contagion has demonstrated significant effects of network topology on the dynamics of diffusion. However, network topologies are not given a priori. Rather, they are patterns of relations that emerge from individual and structural features of society, such as population composition, group heterogeneity, homophily, and social consolidation. Following Blau and Schwartz, the author develops a model of social network formation that explores how social and structural constraints on tie formation generate emergent social topologies and then explores the effectiveness of these social networks for the dynamics of social diffusion. Results show that, at one extreme, high levels of consolidation can create highly balkanized communities with poor integration of shared norms and practices. As suggested by Blau and Schwartz, reducing consolidation creates more crosscutting circles and significantly improves the dynamics of social diffusion across the population. However, the author finds that further reducing consolidation creates highly intersecting social networks that fail to support the widespread diffusion of norms and practices, indicating that successful social diffusion can depend on moderate to high levels of structural consolidation.

<title>The Effects of Prime Supporters within a College Student's Support Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>College students face academic and emotional challenges within and outside of the classroom. There is not a unique way to deal with all of these challenges, however obtaining support from other individuals in their network can be an important factor in their success in dealing with these challenges. Exploratory social support network data from 38 undergraduate students were collected and analyzed to find common network structures and examine the relationship between these structures and student characteristics, GPA, perceived social support, and use of other help resources. We found half of the students had what we defined to be a novel network characteristic, prime supporters, which are individuals who provided academic and emotional support to students for both routine and intense academic and emotional problems. We found students with a prime supporter in their social network tended to have higher GPAs and perceived social support than those without a prime supporter. Students with prime supporters also had differences in academic help-seeking behavior. These findings suggest the need for further research on the social networks of college students, particularly the presence of individuals who are providers of multiple sources of support.

<title>Gatekeeping Fake News Discourses on Mainstream Media Versus Social Media</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439318795849</url>
<snippet>This study analyzes mainstream media (MSM) coverage of fake news discourse and compares it with social networking sites (SNS) users who reference the term "fakenews" in their tweets. The study employs computational methods by analyzing over 8 million tweets and 1,350 news stories using topic modeling. Building on the theory of (networked) gatekeeping and Herman and Chomsky's propaganda model, the results show that SNS users follow networked gatekeeping practices by mostly associating fake news references to the alleged bias of MSM. On the other hand, MSM coverage tends to link fake news to SNS's negative role in spreading misinformation. I argue here that there is a networked flak activity on Twitter which is defined as a collective negative response to MSM in order to discipline it, change its tone and editorial stance, or undermine the public's trust in it.

<title>Social support and mental health in late adolescence are correlated for genetic, as well as environmental, reasons</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-13449-2</url>
<snippet>Late adolescence is a crucial, but underexplored, developmental stage with respect to the aetiology of social support. These individuals are experiencing many major life changes and social support can help them adjust to the associated environmental stressors of this time. Using 1,215 18-year-old twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study, we collected measures of two indices of support: support quality and support quantity, as well as wellbeing and depression. Both support indices were moderately heritable (55&#37; and 49&#37;, respectively), an interesting finding given the many environmental changes that late adolescents are encountering that could be environmentally altering their social network structures. Finding a genetic influence on support suggests the presence of gene-environment correlation whereby individuals create and perceive their supportive environment based upon their genetic predispositions. Shared genetic influences mediated the moderate phenotypic correlation (mean r = 0.46) between support and mental health. Genetic correlations were higher between support quality and mental health (mean rA = 0.75), than between support quantity and mental health (mean rA = 0.54), reflecting the phenotypic pattern. This suggests that interventions should focus more on making late adolescents aware of the support quality around them than encouraging them to increase their social network size.

<title>A Network-Based Indicator of Travelers Performativity on Instagram</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-020-02326-7</url>
<snippet>The spread of Internet and online social media has created a huge amount of data able to provide new insights to researchers in different disciplinary fields, but it also presents new challenges for data science. Data arising from online social networks can be naturally coded as relational data in affiliation and adjacency matrices, then analyzed with social network analysis. In this study, we apply an interdisciplinary approach (based on automatic visual content analysis, social network analysis, and exploratory statistical techniques) to define and derive a suitable indicator for characterizing places, along with the online activities of travelers, in terms of sharing images. We envisage a novel storytelling perspective where stories are related to places and the narrative activity is realized through posting images. Specifically, we use data extracted from an online social network (i.e., Instagram) to identify travelers' paths among sites of interests. Starting from a large collection of pictures geolocalized in a pre-specified set of locations (i.e., five locations in the Campania region of Italy during the 2018 Christmas season), we use automatic alternative text to produce an ex-post taxonomy of images on the most recurrent themes emerging from pictures posted on Instagram. Quantitative measures defined on the co-occurrence of locations and the emerging themes are used to build a statistical indicator able to characterize paths among different locations as narrated from travelers' posts. The proposed analysis, presented and discussed along with real data, can be useful for stakeholders interested in the fields of policy-making, communication design, and territory profiling strategies.

<title>Twitter and divides in the Dutch parliament: social and political segregation in the following, @-mentions and retweets networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2024.2305159</url>
<snippet>MPs communication on Twitter with other MPs may facilitate forming cross-party solidarity networks and provide public micro deliberation but may also be segregated leading to information bubbles and political polarization. That party-based division lines are running through the online communication networks of politicians is a well-established finding in social media studies; however important knowledge gaps have remained on the complexity of Twitter's multilayered network developments and their interrelatedness with socio-demographic segregation. Here, we integrate the online-network literature with that on the political consequences of the digital architecture of social media platforms to theorize and scrutinize the extent to which and why Twitter following, @-mentioning and retweeting networks among MPs are segregated along party lines and sex, age and ethnicity. Our unique dynamic take allows us to rigorously study network segregation, including feedback mechanisms between Twitter layers, based on descriptive network statistics and SIENA analyses for Dutch MPs at three time points. The findings show that political segregation patterns are strongest within the retweet layer and weakest for @-mentions. The interrelations between the Twitter network layers aggravate party-based segregation over time. MP Twitter networks are not consistently segregated along social dimensions.

<title>Networking Behavior as a Mediation in University Graduates' HEXACO Personality Effects on Job Search Outcomes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440221091818</url>
<snippet>Based on the individual difference and social network theory, this research proposed the mediation model, with job search networking behavior as a mediator in the links between six HEXACO personality dimensions and job search outcomes. A survey was implemented in a sample of 773 university graduates. The findings suggest that honesty-humility, extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience were positively, while emotionality was negatively, related to networking behavior. In turn, networking behavior was positively related to number of job interviews obtained and number of job offers received. Furthermore, the results showed the mediating role of networking behavior in the personality traits-job search outcomes relationships. The findings are discussed in both theory and practical implications.

<title>Brain Sensitivity to Exclusion is Associated with Core Network Closure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-33624-3</url>
<snippet>Humans are driven to pursue and preserve social relationships, and these motivations are reinforced through biological systems. In particular, individual differences in the tuning of biological systems that respond to social threats may motivate individuals to seek out differently structured social environments. Drawing on a sample of adolescent males who underwent fMRI brain imaging (n = 74) and contributed Facebook data, we examined whether biological responses to a common scenariobeing excluded from an activity with peers -was associated with their social network structure. We find that neural responses during social exclusion in a priori hypothesized "social pain" regions of the brain (dACC, AI, subACC) are associated with the density and transitivity of core friendship networks. These findings suggest that neural reactivity to exclusion may be one factor that underlies network "safety". More broadly, the study shows the potential of linking social cognitive tendencies to social structural properties.

<title>Low credibility URL sharing on Twitter during reporting linking rare blood clots with the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0296444</url>
<snippet>The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by an "infodemic" of misinformation. Misleading narratives around the virus, its origin, and treatments have had serious implications for public health. In March 2021, concerns were raised about links between the Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZ) COVID-19 vaccine and recipients developing blood clots. This paper aims to identify whether this prompted any reaction in the diffusion of low-credibility COVID-19-relate information on Twitter. Twitter's application programming interface was used to collect data containing COVID-19-related keywords between 4th and 25th March 2021, a period centred on the peak of new coverage linking rare blood clots with the AZ vaccine. We analysed and visualised the data using temporal analysis and social network analysis tools. We subsequently analysed the data to determine the most influential users and domains in the propagation of low-credibility information about COVID-19 and the AZ vaccine. This research presents evidence that the peak of news coverage linking rare blood clots with the AZ vaccine correlated with an increased volume and proportion of low-credibility AZ-related content propagated on Twitter. However, no equivalent changes to the volume, propagation, or network structure for the full dataset of COVID-19-related information or misinformation were observed. The research identified RT.com as the most prolific creator of low-credibility COVID-19-related content. It also highlighted the crucial role of self-promotion in the successful propagation of low-credibility content on Twitter. The findings suggest that the simple approach adopted within the research to identify the most popular and influential sources of low-credibility content presents a valuable opportunity for public health authorities and social media platforms to develop bespoke strategies to counter the propagation of misinformation in the aftermath of a breaking news event.

<title>Dynamic games on arbitrary networks with two types of players</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmateco.2024.102990</url>
<snippet>We focus on asymmetric games on networks with two types of players characterized by their different intrinsic preferences. In general, it is NP -hard to calculate a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (PNE) for an asymmetric network game, which makes us difficult to predict the evolutionary outcome. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the tempered best response dynamics (tBRD). We develop an approximate approach that can transform the tBRD into a system of deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODE) for 2 x 2 asymmetric games with arbitrary payoff values and network structures. This then allows us to evaluate the effect of network structure on the evolutionary outcome without calculating the PNE. We highlight the importance of the network homophily index in the strategy evolution. For games with strategic complements, a lower homophily index promotes coordination. In contrast, games with strategic substitutes have a unique stable equilibrium for a higher homophily index and have two stable equilibria for a low homophily index. Finally, for games with a mixture of strategic complements and strategic substitutes, a lower homophily index in general promote cyclic behaviors and inhibits the existence of stable equilibrium. We then apply our approach to analyze the influence of social networks on the election and discuss the electoral strategies for the majority and minority parties.

<title>Social class, social networks and variety of weak and strong practices</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/soc4.13124</url>
<snippet>Most research on the structural foundations of cultural consumption views tastes and practices as a better or worse emanation of social class or status. In contrast, this paper shows that cultural consumption is also embedded in a larger system of social networks. Not only does it examine whether having more diversified personal network translates into being involved in a wider range of cultural activities (omnivorousness), it also tests whether holding networks of different strength corresponds with different levels of cultural engagement (strong vs. weak). Based on the survey data collected in Poland in 2017, the analyses yield three main findings. First, cultural consumption continues to reflect social class divisions and is a potential mechanism for social exclusion. Second, network diversity is associated with cultural variety independently of class position. Third, the number of weak ties people hold is more strongly associated with the number of "weak" practices (that is practices of less frequency) and the number of strong ties is positively associated with the number of strong practices (voraciousness). These findings are discussed in terms of balance theory, interactional foci and weak versus strong culture. The implications of the article are that omnivorism both signifies class boundaries and indicates participation in different network structures.

<title>The geographical dynamics of global R&amp;D collaboration networks in robotics: Evidence from co-patenting activities across urban areas worldwide</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281353</url>
<snippet>The focus of this study is on the geography of robotics Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities. The objectives are, first, to identify hotspots in robotics R&amp;D worldwide, and second, to characterise structures and dynamics of global robotics R&amp;D collaboration networks through detailed geographical lenses of global urban areas. We use patents as marker for R&amp;D activities, and accordingly focus on technologically oriented R&amp;D, drawing on information from patents applied for between 2002 and 2016. We employ an appropriate search strategy to identify relevant robotics patents based on detailed levels of the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) and assign patents to more than 900 global urban areas based on the inventor addresses. The co-patent networks are examined from a Social Network Analysis (SNA) perspective by means of robotics co-patents, contributing to a global network where urban areas are the nodes inter-linked by joint inventive activities recorded in robotics patents. Global SNA measures illustrate structures and dynamics of the network as a whole, while local measures indicate the specific positioning and roles of urban areas in the network. The results are original in characterising the global spatial emergence of this generic new industry, highlighting prominent urban hotspots in terms of specialisation in robotics R&amp;D, pointing to a global shift reflected by the increasing role of emerging economies, in particular China. The global robotics R&amp;D has grown significantly both in total patenting and also in terms of R&amp;D collaboration activities between urban areas. Also, for the networks, growth is not equally distributed, but is rather characterised by significant spatial shifts, both in terms of cities declining or climbing up the specialisation ranking, but even more in terms of the spatial network structure.

<title>Estimating the causal effect of social capital: A review of recent research</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.32.061604.123150</url>
<snippet>Although there is a large literature on social capital, empirical estimates of the effect of social capital may be biased because of social homophily, the tendency of similar people to become friends with each other. Despite the methodological difficulties, a recent literature has emerged across several different disciplines that tries to estimate the causal effect of social capital. This paper reviews this recent empirical literature on social capital, paying close attention to the statistical and theoretical assumptions involved. Overall, there is evidence that genuine progress has been made in estimating the effect of social capital. The reviewed articles should provide useful examples for future research.

<title>Building Bridges: Exploring the Communication Trends and Perceived Sociopolitical Benefits of Adolescents Engaging in Online Social Justice Efforts</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0044118X17723656</url>
<snippet>The exploration of social networking sites (SNS) offers great potential for understanding novel forms of youth civic engagement within the 21st century. SNS can foster a young person's social capital by connecting them to others with different backgrounds, thereby exposing them to alternative perspectives and lived experiences within a growingly polarized political environment. This study provides an innovative framework for examining the communication trends and perceived sociopolitical benefits for adolescents engaging diverse groups in a youth-led social-justice-oriented SNS. The author linked three school-based youth participatory action research projects involving 54 high school students through an SNS. Employing a mixed-method approach (i.e., social network analysis, key student interviews), results indicate an increase in communication between students in different schools and an increase in levels of civic participation. In addition, interviewees reported perceived gains in communication, perspective taking, and sociopolitical awareness. Implications for practitioners, as well as future research, are discussed.

<title>Research on opinion polarization by big data analytics capabilities in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.101902</url>
<snippet>Opinion polarization in online social networks causes a lot of concerns on its social, economic, and political impacts, and is becoming an important topic for academic research. Based on the system theory, a theoretical framework on analyzing opinion polarization combining big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) is proposed. A web crawler is used to collect data from the Sina Weibo platform on the topic of "Tangping". Concerning the characteristics of the big data environment, social network analysis (SNA), machine learning, text clustering and content analysis are used to mine opinion polarization of "Tangping" on Weibo. Results show that social network users holding the same opinion indicate the phenomenon of aggregation. Although no influential users support the opinion of "Tangping" on Weibo, a high percentage of people advocate the idea. The supporting group has the most clusters while the opposing group has the highest density of keywords. The research contributes to the existing literature on applying BDAC to analyze online polarization from the perspective of the system from user behavior and interaction to topic clustering and keywords identification. The conceptual system framework shows superiority in the integration of information coordination of microsystem and exosystem. Guidance strategies are put forward to supplement the formation theory of opinion polarization and provide suggestions to reasonably regulate network group polarization.

<title>Modelling opinion dynamics in the age of algorithmic personalisation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-43830-2</url>
<snippet>Modern technology has drastically changed the way we interact and consume information. For example, online social platforms allow for seamless communication exchanges at an unprecedented scale. However, we are still bounded by cognitive and temporal constraints. Our attention is limited and extremely valuable. Algorithmic personalisation has become a standard approach to tackle the information overload problem. As result, the exposure to our friends' opinions and our perception about important issues might be distorted. However, the effects of algorithmic gatekeeping on our hyper-connected society are poorly understood. Here, we devise an opinion dynamics model where individuals are connected through a social network and adopt opinions as function of the view points they are exposed to. We apply various filtering algorithms that select the opinions shown to each user (i) at random (ii) considering time ordering or (iii) its current opinion. Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between such mechanisms and crucial features of real networks. We found that algorithmic filtering might influence opinions' share and distributions, especially in case information is biased towards the current opinion of each user. These effects are reinforced in networks featuring topological and spatial correlations where echo chambers and polarisation emerge. Conversely, heterogeneity in connectivity patterns reduces such tendency. We consider also a scenario where one opinion, through nudging, is centrally pushed to all users. Interestingly, even minimal nudging is able to change the status quo moving it towards the desired view point. Our findings suggest that simple filtering algorithms might be powerful tools to regulate opinion dynamics taking place on social networks.

<snippet>The ongoing debate surrounding the impact of the Internet Research Agency's (IRA) social media campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential election has largely overshadowed the involvement of other actors. Our analysis brings to light a substantial group of suspended Twitter users, outnumbering the IRA user group by a factor of 60, who align with the ideologies of the IRA campaign. Our study demonstrates that this group of suspended Twitter accounts significantly influenced individuals categorized as undecided or weak supporters, potentially with the aim of swaying their opinions, as indicated by Granger causality.

<title>Bursts of communication increase opinion diversity in the temporal Deffuant model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-52458-w</url>
<snippet>Human interactions create social networks forming the backbone of societies. Individuals adjust their opinions by exchanging information through social interactions. Two recurrent questions are whether social structures promote opinion polarisation or consensus and whether polarisation can be avoided, particularly on social media. In this paper, we hypothesise that not only network structure but also the timings of social interactions regulate the emergence of opinion clusters. We devise a temporal version of the Deffuant opinion model where pairwise social interactions follow temporal patterns. Individuals may self-organise into a multi-partisan society due to network clustering promoting the reinforcement of local opinions. Burstiness has a similar effect and is alone sufficient to refrain the population from consensus and polarisation by also promoting the reinforcement of local opinions. The diversity of opinions in socially clustered networks thus increases with burstiness, particularly, and counter-intuitively, when individuals have low tolerance and prefer to adjust to similar peers. The emergent opinion landscape is well-balanced regarding groups' size, with relatively short differences between groups, and a small fraction of extremists. We argue that polarisation is more likely to emerge in social media than offline social networks because of the relatively low social clustering observed online, despite the observed online burstiness being sufficient to promote more diversity than would be expected offline. Increasing the variance of burst activation times, e.g. by being less active on social media, could be a venue to reduce polarisation. Furthermore, strengthening online social networks by increasing social redundancy, i.e. triangles, may also promote diversity.

<title>Self-Presentation and Adolescent Altruistic Behaviors in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/1719564</url>
<snippet>Social networks provide a convenient place for people to interact; members in social networks may create new connections or break existing connections, driving the evolution of complex network structure. Dynamics in social networks, such as opinion formation and spreading dynamics, may result in complex collective phenomena. This paper conducts a survey on 495 students from six schools in Shaanxi, Henan, and Zhejiang provinces and discusses the impact of self-presentation on adolescent network altruistic behaviors, the intermediary role of social ability cognition, and the moderating role of privacy awareness. The results show the following: (1) Self-presentation in social networks can positively predict adolescent network altruistic behaviors. The positive prediction effect of network sharing is the largest, and the positive prediction effect of network support is the least. (2) Social ability cognition plays an intermediary role between self-presentation and adolescent network altruistic behaviors. (3) The moderating effect of privacy awareness is not significant.

<title>Facebook: public space, or private space?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2013.870591</url>
<snippet>Social networks have become a central feature of everyday life. Most young people are members of at least one online social network, and they naturally provide a great deal of personal information as a condition for participation in the rich online social lives these networks afford. Increasingly, this information is being used as evidence in criminal and even civil legal proceedings. These latter uses, by actors involved in the justice system, are typically justified on the grounds that social network information is essentially public in nature, and thus does not generate a subjective expectation of privacy necessary to support a civil rights-based privacy protection. This justification, however, is based on the perceptions of individuals who are outside the online social network community, rather than reflecting the norms and privacy practices of participants in online social networks. This project takes a user-centric approach to the question of whether online social spaces are public venues, examining of the information-related practices of social network participants, focusing on how they treat their own information and that of others posted in online social spaces. Our results reveal that online social spaces are indeed loci of public display rather than private revelation: online profiles are structured with the view that 'everyone' can see them, even if the explicitly intended audience is more limited. These social norms are inconsistent with the claim that social media are private spaces; instead, it appears that participants view and treat online social networks as public venues.

<title>The role of crowdsourcing in product design: The moderating effect of user expertise and network connectivity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101496</url>
<snippet>To meet the challenges of customization and personalized design in the context of the digital economy, increasing numbers of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are using crowdsourcing platforms to seek product design innovation. While crowdsourcing has significant potential for eliciting product ideas, it remains unclear whether it can generate high-quality designs for relatively more complex product design tasks. Based on a leading social new product development website Quirky.com, we explore the antecedents of a firm?s adoption decision of crowdsourcing, the impact of crowdsourcing on product design quality, and the moderating effect of user expertise and network connectivity by utilizing treatment effect model. The results indicate that: (1) crowdsourcing has a significant positive impact on product design quality; (2) user expertise positively moderates the role of crowdsourcing in product design quality; (3) network connectivity has an inverted U-shaped moderating effect on crowdsourcing and product design quality relationship; (4) the probability of firm?s crowdsourcing adoption is negatively correlated with the complexity and reliability of initial product idea but positively correlated with popularity, novelty, and numbers of images. This study not only enriches the crowdsourcing and social network theory; but also provides guidance for crowdsourcing platform firms to better manage the crowdsourcing process and user crowdsourcing communities.

<title>Mapping the connections of health professionals to COVID-19 myths and facts in the Australian Twittersphere</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2022.2032260</url>
<snippet>The spread of COVID-19 misinformation on social media has elicited concern amongst scholars, health agencies and governments owing to its potential harms to public health. This article addresses the question of how networks of Australian health professionals engaged with COVID-19 facts and myths on Twitter between August and October 2020. After reviewing selected literature on COVID-19 misinformation, we present our analytical choices and the methodology we used to constitute datasets of COVID-19 factual and mythical hashtags and of verified Australian health professional accounts (N:377). The article distinguishes between the capacities of 'actor-actants' and 'issue-actants,' and between the adoption of 'field' and 'contested' hashtags during a controversy. We identify categories of Australian health professional Twitter accounts such as GPs, nurses, specialists, public health professionals and researchers, and analyse the patterns of connections between these actor-actants and COVID-19 facts and myths. We find that these categories exhibit clearly distinct behaviour when tweeting or retweeting factual and mythical hashtags. Even though the rate of Australian health professionals' connection with myths in comparison to facts on Twitter is low, hashtags such as #hydroxychloroquine attracted significant engagement. We examine these hashtags' context and find that they were mainly being debunked, though a minority of accounts endorsed them. We analyse these adoption patterns, and critically assess the 'echo chamber effect.' We also consider public health and privacy implications for the dissemination of accurate information, for trust in health professionals during a pandemic, and for combatting misinformation.

<title>(De)Politicizing Polyamory: Social Media Comments on Media Representations of Consensual Non-Monogamies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-020-01887-5</url>
<snippet>Our research sits at the intersection of communication studies, sociology, cyberculture, and political philosophy and theory. In 2014, a 10+-min segment on polyamory aired on Portuguese open-access national television, during the prime-time newscast, and was viewed by several million people, according to official reports. The news piece was also advertised and shared online, especially via Facebook, by the network's official page. Moreover, the piece was aired within the context of a segment that celebrated the 40-year anniversary of the 1974 liberal revolution that overthrew the right-wing dictatorial regime that ruled Portugal for more than half of the twentieth century. This context served to frame polyamory (alongside other topics) as explicitly political by presenting them as freedoms seized by that liberal revolution. This study used a mixed-method approach to the analysis of online comments on Facebook made with respect to the referred news piece, by deploying both content analysis and critical discourse analysis to try to understand how the political nature of polyamory is negotiated (affirmed or disavowed), and what ideal of the "political" is mobilized in that negotiation, in connection with other elements of intimate citizenship and modes of systemic discrimination. Through this analysis, we will deepen our understanding of how lay people construe the "political" and the (non-)politicalness of polyamory. It also helps advance contemporary understandings of how polyamory is represented in mainstream media, understood by audiences, and how media-and debates on online social networks-can both amplify and help fight against harmful stereotypes of minorities. Through this research, we contribute to political theory by opening up new ways of conceptualizing the realm of the political as an open-ended definition that must encompass changes in modes of sociality, including a politics of relating as a sub-field, likewise to the study of social movements, and their strategies, around consensual non-monogamies. Overall, results show that the recognition of the validity of polyamory is not the same as the realization that relationship orientation is a political issue in itself and that a privatized mode of understanding politics seems prevalent as well as the default framework used in the comments we analyzed. In addition to that, and as other research has already noted, incivility and hate speech was prevalent in online comments and discussions, further dampening the political potential of dissident modes of existence, especially given that incivility is also deployed by those speaking in favor of Othered identities and experiences.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-29224-w</url>
<snippet>The dynamics of social networks is a complex process, as there are many factors which contribute to the formation and evolution of social links. While certain real-world properties are captured by the degree-driven preferential attachment model, it still cannot fully explain social network dynamics. Indeed, important properties such as dynamic community formation, link weight evolution, or degree saturation cannot be completely and simultaneously described by state of the art models. In this paper, we explore the distribution of social network parameters and centralities and argue that node degree is not the main attractor of new social links. Consequently, as node betweenness proves to be paramount to attracting new links - as well as strengthening existing links -, we propose the new Weighted Betweenness Preferential Attachment (WBPA) model, which renders quantitatively robust results on realistic network metrics. Moreover, we support our WBPA model with a socio-psychological interpretation, that offers a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind social network dynamics.

<title>Inadequate Interactions and Unbalanced Power Between Scientists and the Public in Chinese Knowledge Sharing Network: Social Network Analysis of the Topic of Genetically Modified Food on Zhihu</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393221087668</url>
<snippet>This study takes the scientific discussion about genetically modified food on Zhihu as an example, using the method of social network analysis to explore the interactions between Chinese scientists and the public online. The findings indicate that both scientists and non-scientists are inclined to interact with users with a similar identity. Cross-group interactions seem to be hard to achieve on Zhihu. Furthermore, compared with non-scientists, scientist users tend to hold significantly stronger digital social capital than non-scientists on Zhihu. It is suggested that the knowledge sharing network has not fully achieved the goal of effectively promoting equally science dialogue in China.

<title>Wired to mobilize: The effect of social networking messages on voter turnout</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2014.09.004</url>
<snippet>Recent scholarship has documented the effect of online social networking on political participation, a relationship hypothesized to be due to the generation of social capital. This paper tests the hypothesis that impersonal get-out-the-vote messages delivered via an online social network can increase voter turnout. Specifically, this study uses a field experiment of randomly assigned students from a large southern public university to test the effect of exposure to political messages via Facebook on the likelihood of them voting in the November 2010 election. The results indicate that encouragements to vote delivered through a social networking site can have substantively large effects on political behavior. (C) 2014 Western Social Science Association.

<title>Collaboration strategies for publishing articles in international journals - A study of Polish scientists in economics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2015.07.001</url>
<snippet>This study investigates the importance of co-authorship ego-networks to scientific performance. In particular, the focus is on Polish researchers in economics, who need 'catch-up strategies' to aid them in publishing papers in international journals. Brokerage is identified as one of the most important correlatives of publishing success. However, in many cases, the best performers are smart collaborators who take advantage of the benefits of both bridging and bonding social capital. In general, co-authorship itself does not provide an advantage. Instead, a proper collaboration strategy appears to be more important. Additionally, embeddedness of authors within their affiliations should be considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Validation of the Social Networking Activity Intensity Scale among Junior Middle School Students in China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165695</url>
<snippet>Background Online social networking use has been integrated into adolescents' daily life and the intensity of online social networking use may have important consequences on adolescents' well-being. However, there are few validated instruments to measure social networking use intensity. The present study aims to develop the Social Networking Activity Intensity Scale (SNAIS) and validate it among junior middle school students in China. Methods A total of 910 students who were social networking users were recruited from two junior middle schools in Guangzhou, and 114 students were retested after two weeks to examine the test-retest reliability. The psychometrics of the SNAIS were estimated using appropriate statistical methods. Results Two factors, Social Function Use Intensity (SFUI) and Entertainment Function Use Intensity (EFUI), were clearly identified by both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. No ceiling or floor effects were observed for the SNAIS and its two subscales. The SNAIS and its two subscales exhibited acceptable reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89, 0.90 and 0.60, and test-retest Intra-class Correlation Coefficient = 0.85, 0.87 and 0.67 for Overall scale, SFUI and EFUI subscale, respectively, p&lt;0.001). As expected, the SNAIS and its subscale scores were correlated significantly with emotional connection to social networking, social networking addiction, Internet addiction, and characteristics related to social networking use. Conclusions The SNAIS is an easily self-administered scale with good psychometric properties. It would facilitate more research in this field worldwide and specifically in the Chinese population.

<title>The digital covenant: non-centralized platform governance on the mastodon social network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2022.2147400</url>
<snippet>The majority of scholarship on platform governance focuses on for-profit, corporate social media with highly centralized network structures. Instead, we show how non-centralized platform governance functions in the Mastodon social network. Through an analysis of survey data, Github and Discourse developer discussions, Mastodon Codes of Conduct, and participant observations, we argue Mastodon's platform governance is an exemplar of the covenant, a key concept from federalist political theory. We contrast Mastodon's covenantal federalism platform governance with the contractual form used by corporate social media. We also use covenantal federalist theory to explain how Mastodon's users, administrators, and developers justify revoking or denying membership in the federation. In doing so, this study sheds new light on the innovations in platform governance that go beyond the corporate/alt-right platform dichotomy.

<title>Embedded Distress: Social Integration, Gender, and Adolescent Depression</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/soac034</url>
<snippet>In adolescence, teens manage close friendships while simultaneously evaluating their social position in the larger peer context. Conceptualizing distinct local and global network structures clarifies how social integration relates to mental wellbeing. Examining local cohesion and global embeddedness in the context of key factors related to mental health, such as gender and friends' depression, can further distinguish when the structure and content of social integration relate to higher and lower depressive levels. Analyses using survey data from PROSPER (n = 27,091, grades 9-12) indicate global embeddedness is generally protective, but for girls, greater global embeddedness when friends are more depressive is associated with increased depressive symptoms. For girls, greater local cohesion reduces associations between more depressive friends and increased depressive levels, while for boys, both local cohesion and friends' depression are largely irrelevant. Results indicate the importance of considering both local and global network integration in tandem with gender and friends' depression to understand how social integration relates to mental health.

<title>Spreading of fake news, competence and learning: kinetic modelling and numerical approximation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2021.0159</url>
<snippet>The rise of social networks as the primary means of communication in almost every country in the world has simultaneously triggered an increase in the amount of fake news circulating online. The urgent need for models that can describe the growing infodemic of fake news has been highlighted by the current pandemic. The resulting slowdown in vaccination campaigns due to misinformation and generally the inability of individuals to discern the reliability of information is posing enormous risks to the governments of many countries. In this research using the tools of kinetic theory, we describe the interaction between fake news spreading and competence of individuals through multi-population models in which fake news spreads analogously to an infectious disease with different impact depending on the level of competence of individuals. The level of competence, in particular, is subject to evolutionary dynamics due to both social interactions between agents and external learning dynamics. The results show how the model is able to correctly describe the dynamics of diffusion of fake news and the important role of competence in their containment.This article is part of the theme issue 'Kinetic exchange models of societies and economies'.

<title>Reconsidering evidence of moral contagion in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01133-5</url>
<snippet>The ubiquity of social media use and the digital data traces it produces has triggered a potential methodological shift in the psychological sciences away from traditional, laboratory-based experimentation. The hope is that, by using computational social science methods to analyse large-scale observational data from social media, human behaviour can be studied with greater statistical power and ecological validity. However, current standards of null hypothesis significance testing and correlational statistics seem ill-suited to markedly noisy, high-dimensional social media datasets. We explore this point by probing the moral contagion phenomenon, whereby the use of moral-emotional language increases the probability of message spread. Through out-of-sample prediction, model comparisons and specification curve analyses, we find that the moral contagion model performs no better than an implausible XYZ contagion model. This highlights the risks of using purely correlational evidence from large observational datasets and sounds a cautionary note for psychology's merge with big data. Burton et al. probe the question of moral contagion through out-of-sample prediction, model comparisons and specification curve analyses, demonstrating the limitations of conclusions based on large-scale, observational social media datasets alone.

<title>Civility 2.0: a comparative analysis of incivility in online political discussion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2014.940365</url>
<snippet>In an effort to clean up user comment sections, news organizations have turned to Facebook, the world's largest social network site, as a way to make users more identifiable and accountable for the content they produce. It is hypothesized that users leaving comments via their Facebook profile will be less likely to engage in uncivil and impolite discussion, even when it comes to discussing politically sensitive and potentially divisive issues. By analysing the content of discussion as it occurs in response to political news content on the Washington Post Facebook, and comparing it to that which occurs on the Washington Post website where users are afforded a relatively high level of anonymity, the present study determines the extent to which Facebook increases the level of civility and impoliteness in an area of political discussion renowned for uncivil and impolite communicative behaviour. In line with earlier theories of social interaction, the paper finds that political discussion on The Washington Post website is significantly more likely to be uncivil than discussion of the same content on the Washington Post Facebook page. Moreover, the incivility and impoliteness on the Washington Post website are significantly more likely to be directed towards other participants in the discussion compared to The Washington Post Facebook page.

<title>Does it take &lt;i&gt;three&lt;/i&gt; to dance the Tango? Organizational design, triadic structures and boundary spanning across subunits</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.04.002</url>
<snippet>In this paper, we investigate the processes of boundary spanning across subunits within organizational networks. We hypothesize that patterns of advice across organizational subunits are explained by different triadic mechanisms depending on the organizational design of the intra-organizational network. In organizational networks characterized by limited hierarchical differentiation among members and horizontal coordination, we found triadic cyclic closure to be positively associated to boundary spanning across subunits; but when the network reflects an organizational structure with formal hierarchical differentiation among members, then we found triadic transitive closure to be associated to boundary spanning across subunits. We test these predictions in two empirical studies consisting of two organizational networks that differ from each other in organizational design. We adopt a Bayesian approach for exponential random graph models specifically designed for the statistical analysis of interpersonal relationships within and across subgroups or subunits. We suggest that the effects of informal, triadic network configurations on boundary spanning are contingent on formal organizational design.

<title>Homophily in the Guise of Cross-Linking: Political Blogs and Content</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764214527090</url>
<snippet>This study examines the behavior of influential political blogs (conservative and liberal) in reference to external viral content during March 2007 and June 2009. We analyze homophily and cross-ideological (heterophily) practices. We propose a multidimensional model that employs both qualitative and quantitative methods for examining homophily behaviors by looking at three dimensions: blog-to-blog, blog-tovideo, blog post-to-video. Findings show that while homophily patterns prevail, some limited occurrences of cross-ideological practices exist. The cross-linking practices may include deliberative motives, but in essence they are not created for the purposes of discourse. Instead, these cross-linking practices strengthen previously held political stances of the users who create them and negatively portray and reframe content of alternative views. This represents homophily in the guise of cross-linking.

<title>What Drives Ethnic Homophily? A Relational Approach on How Ethnic Identification Moderates Preferences for Same-Ethnic Friends</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122419846849</url>
<snippet>Individual preferences for same-ethnic friends contribute to persistent segregation of adolescents' friendship networks. Yet, we know surprisingly little about the mechanisms behind ethnic homophily. Prior research suggests that ethnic homophily is ubiquitous, but a social identity perspective indicates that strong ingroup identification drives ingroup favoritism. Combining a social identity perspective with a relational approach, we ask whether the presumed increased homophily of high identifiers extends to all ingroup members, or whether it is conditional on the strength of same-ethnics' identification. We propose that the strength of ethnic identification affects not only how much individuals desire same-ethnic friends, but also how attractive they are as potential friends to others. Fitting stochastic actor-oriented models to German adolescent school-based network panel data, we find that ethnic homophily is driven by an interplay of peers' ethnic identification: high identifiers befriend same-ethnic peers who share their strong ethnic identification, while excluding same-ethnic low identifiers. Low identifiers, in turn, tend to avoid befriending inter-ethnic high identifiers. Our relational approach reveals that ethnic homophily is hardly ubiquitous but requires strong identification of both parties of a (potential) friendship.

<title>Competition between global and local online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep25116</url>
<snippet>The overwhelming success of online social networks, the key actors in the Web 2.0 cosmos, has reshaped human interactions globally. To help understand the fundamental mechanisms which determine the fate of online social networks at the system level, we describe the digital world as a complex ecosystem of interacting networks. In this paper, we study the impact of heterogeneity in network fitnesses on the competition between an international network, such as Facebook, and local services. The higher fitness of international networks is induced by their ability to attract users from all over the world, which can then establish social interactions without the limitations of local networks. In other words, inter-country social ties lead to increased fitness of the international network. To study the competition between an international network and local ones, we construct a 1: 1000 scale model of the digital world, consisting of the 80 countries with the most Internet users. Under certain conditions, this leads to the extinction of local networks; whereas under different conditions, local networks can persist and even dominate completely. In particular, our model suggests that, with the parameters that best reproduce the empirical overtake of Facebook, this overtake could have not taken place with a significant probability.

<title>Nonreligious Group Factors Versus Religious Belief in the Prediction of Prosociality</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-014-0700-0</url>
<snippet>Previous research has suggested that religious belief is associated with a range of prosocial behaviors such as social embeddedness and generosity. However, this literature has often conflated belief in God with group involvement and failed to control for demographic and social network effects. Rather than assessing prosociality by comparing religious group members with the unaffiliated, the present study also includes secular/nonreligious group members. Multiple regression analyses controlling for confounds diminishes many of the apparent differences between religious and nonreligious individuals. Belief in God itself accounts for approximately 1-2 &#37; of the variance in social embeddedness domains and &lt; 1 &#37; of the variance in the domains of outside-group charity and community volunteering. Belief in God is associated with homophily and parochial behavior such as within-group charitable donations and constrained contact with different others. These findings indicate that prosocial benefits are more related to general group membership equally available to religious and secular group members alike than they are to specifically religious content. Religious beliefs are related to within-group prosociality as well as homophily and parochialism directed to those outside the group.

<title>Social influence and political mobilization: Further evidence from a randomized experiment in the 2012 US presidential election</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173851</url>
<snippet>A large-scale experiment during the 2010 U.S. Congressional Election demonstrated a positive effect of an online get-out-the-vote message on real world voting behavior. Here, we report results from a replication of the experiment conducted during the U.S. Presidential Election in 2012. In spite of the fact that get-out-the-vote messages typically yield smaller effects during high-stakes elections due to saturation of mobilization efforts from many sources, a significant increase in voting was again observed. Voting also increased significantly among the close friends of those who received the message to go to the polls, and the total effect on the friends was likely larger than the direct effect, suggesting that understanding social influence effects is potentially even more important than understanding the direct effects of messaging. These results replicate earlier work and they add to growing evidence that online social networks can be instrumental for spreading offline behaviors.

<title>Epidemic modeling for misinformation spread in digital networks through a social intelligence approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-69657-0</url>
<snippet>Online digital networks, including social networks, have significantly impacted individuals' personal and professional lives. Aside from exchanging news and topics of interest, digital networks play an essential role in the diffusion of information, which frequently significantly impacts worldwide societies. In this paper, we present a new mathematical epidemic model for digital networks that considers the sentiment of solitary misinformation in the networks and characteristics of human intelligence that play an important role in judging and spreading misinformation inside the networks. Our mathematical analysis has proved the existence and validity of the system in a real-time environment. Considering the real-world data, our simulation predicts how the misinformation could spread among different global communities and when an intervention mechanism should have to be carried out by the policyholders. Our simulation using the model proves that effective intervention mechanisms by isolating the fake news can effectively control the spread of misinformation among larger populations. The model can analyze the emotional and social intelligence of groups frequently subjected to disinformation and disseminating fake news.

<title>Modelling Animal Group Fission Using Social Network Dynamics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0097813</url>
<snippet>Group life involves both advantages and disadvantages, meaning that individuals have to compromise between their nutritional needs and their social links. When a compromise is impossible, the group splits in order to reduce conflict of interests and favour positive social interactions between its members. In this study we built a dynamic model of social networks to represent a succession of temporary fissions involving a change in social relations that could potentially lead to irreversible group fission (i.e. no more group fusion). This is the first study that assesses how a social network changes according to group fission-fusion dynamics. We built a model that was based on different parameters: the group size, the influence of nutritional needs compared to social needs, and the changes in the social network after a temporary fission. The results obtained from this theoretical data indicate how the percentage of social relation transfer, the number of individuals and the relative importance of nutritional requirements and social links influence the average number of days before irreversible fission occurs. The greater the nutritional needs and the higher the transfer of social relations during temporary fission, the fewer days will be observed before an irreversible fission. It is crucial to bridge the gap between the individual and the population level if we hope to understand how simple, local interactions may drive ecological systems.

<title>Exploring the effects of social capital on the compulsive use of online social networks in civil unrest contexts</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09990</url>
<snippet>The use of online social networking sites has become part of everyday life for more than three billion people worldwide. However, its use may go beyond being a habit, leading to compulsive use behaviours that jeopardize the well-being of an individual and the whole society. This study proposes and evaluates a theoretical model that examines the four dimensions of social capital, mediated by bonding and bridging social capital, as drivers of compulsive use of online social networks in the context of civil unrest. We evaluate the model using partial least squares structural equation modelling with data collected from a developing country. We found that reciprocity is the most important driver for bonding and bridging social capital with online members. Whereas trust, contra-dicting most of the literature in the field, was not statistically significant over bonding and bridging social capital. Bonding social capital shows a significant association with compulsive use behaviour. On the other hand, the effect of bridging social capital on compulsive use behaviour, although not significant, may become significant in the presence of a strong usage habit.

<title>Cross-platform analysis of public responses to the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence on Twitter and Reddit</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05359-9</url>
<snippet>Online social networks (OSNs) have become a powerful tool to study collective human responses to extreme events such as earthquakes. Most previous research concentrated on a single platform and utilized users' behaviors on a single platform to study people's general responses. In this study, we explore the characteristics of people's behaviors on different OSNs and conduct a cross-platform analysis of public responses to earthquakes. Our findings support the Uses and Gratification theory that users on Reddit and Twitter are engaging with platforms that they may feel best reflect their sense of self. Using the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes as our study cases, we collected 510,579 tweets and 45,770 Reddit posts (including 1437 submissions and 44,333 comments) to answer the following research questions: (1) What were the similarities and differences between public responses on Twitter and Reddit? (2) Considering the different mechanisms of Twitter and Reddit, what unique information of public responses can we learn from Reddit as compared with Twitter? By answering these research questions, we aim to bridge the gap of cross-platform public responses research towards natural hazards. Our study evinces that the users on the two different platforms have both different topics of interest and different sentiments towards the same earthquake, which indicates the necessity of investigating cross-platform OSNs to reveal a more comprehensive picture of people's general public responses towards certain disasters. Our analysis also finds that r/conspiracy subreddit is one of the major venues where people discuss the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes on Reddit and different misinformation/conspiracies spread on Twitter and Reddit platforms (e.g., "Big one is coming" on Twitter and "Nuclear test" on Reddit).

<title>Social Network Analysis of Nonprofits in Disaster Response: The Case of Twitter During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393221130674</url>
<snippet>The COVID-19 pandemic has created complex problems that require organizations to collaborate within and across the sector line. Social media data can provide insights into how nonprofits interact for the pandemic response from both social network and geographical perspectives. This study innovatively investigated the connection and interaction patterns among 74 National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD) nonprofits and three government agencies based on structural analyses and content analyses of their Twitter communications during the long-term global COVID-19 pandemic. The daily tweeting quantities of all nonprofits were generally consistent with the pandemic severity in the United States before July 2020 and remained stable afterward. Nonprofits' tweets can reflect their purposes of sharing information, building communities, and taking actions for disaster response. Government agencies played leadership roles in providing COVID-19 guidelines and information. Human services, International and Foreign Affairs, and Public and Societal Benefit nonprofits, especially American Red Cross played central roles in the nonprofit communication network. Possible explanations include the following: (1) Geographically, connections and interactions among nonprofits are more likely to happen within the same city or in neighboring states. (2) Both mission homophily and heterophily contribute to connections and interactions among nonprofits, depending on their subsectors. The findings not only help the public better understand how nonprofits are collaboratively fighting the pandemic, but also provide guidance for nonprofits to plan for better interactions and communications in future disaster response.

<title>Homophily and Insularity Dynamics in an Echo Chambers: Computational Models for the Study of the Conspiracy Subculture in Facebook</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-024-03461-1</url>
<snippet>The research focuses on developing a computational model (agent-based) to describe and analyse the structure and evolution of a conspiracy bubble within Facebook. The methodological framework relies on a hypothesis, previously validated in other digital contexts, asserting that user groups interested in conspiracy topics form not isolated cliques but rather constitute a subculture characterised by a system of "subjective understanding" (Tucker, W. T. (1965). Max Weber's verstehen. Sociol Q, 6(2), 157-165) and specific interpretative categories (Russo &amp; Cecconi, Russo, V., Cecconi, F. (2023). Collettivi digitali e cultura della disinformazione. Analisi di una bolla cospirazionista durante la pandemia di Covid-19. Sociologia Italiana, (22).; Barkun, Barkun, A culture of conspiracy: Apocalyptic visions in contemporary America, University of California Press, 2013; Grusauskaite et al., Grusauskaite et al., New Media &amp; Society, 2023). In accordance with this hypothesis, the research design incorporates four types of entities: the conspiracy articles generated in the digital space, the websites where they come from, the public pages and groups where they are shared, and the users engaging with this content. The methodological process unfolds in two phases: (1) descriptive, data mining and analysis of the content and structure of a conspiracy bubble, along with the construction of a relational dataset; (2) experimental, development of the agent-based model, creation of scenarios, model validation, simulation, and subsequent data analysis. The research findings reveal a bubble comprising a singular component characterised by hub nodes functioning as cultural catalysts and specific interpretative categories shared among users. Simulation results show that the network fragments in response to changes in two article properties acting as 'glue': political orientation and the incitement of fear and hate.

<title>How social learning amplifies moral outrage expression in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abe5641</url>
<snippet>Moral outrage shapes fundamental aspects of social life and is now widespread in online social networks. Here, we show how social learning processes amplify online moral outrage expressions over time. In two preregistered observational studies on Twitter (7331 users and 12.7 million total tweets) and two preregistered behavioral experiments (N = 240), we find that positive social feedback for outrage expressions increases the likelihood of future outrage expressions, consistent with principles of reinforcement learning. In addition, users conform their outrage expressions to the expressive norms of their social networks, suggesting norm learning also guides online outrage expressions. Norm learning overshadows reinforcement learning when normative information is readily observable: in ideologically extreme networks, where outrage expression is more common, users are less sensitive to social feedback when deciding whether to express outrage. Our findings highlight how platform design interacts with human learning mechanisms to affect moral discourse in digital public spaces.

<title>A network-based explanation of inequality perceptions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.02.007</url>
<snippet>Across income groups and countries, individual citizens perceive economic inequality spectacularly wrong. These misperceptions have far-reaching consequences, as it might be perceived inequality, not actual inequality informing redistributive preferences. The prevalence of this phenomenon is independent of social class and welfare regime, which suggests the existence of a common mechanism behind public perceptions. The literature has identified several stylised facts on how individual perceptions respond to actual inequality and how these biases vary systematically along the income distribution. We propose a network-based explanation of perceived inequality building on recent advances in random geometric graph theory. The generating mechanism can replicate all of aforementioned stylised facts simultaneously. It also produces social networks that exhibit salient features of real-world networks; namely, they cannot be statistically distinguished from small-world networks, testifying to the robustness of our approach. Our results, therefore, suggest that homophilic segregation is a promising candidate to explain inequality perceptions with strong implications for theories of consumption and voting behaviour.

<title>Building disaster resilience using social messaging networks: the WeChat community in Houston, Texas, during Hurricane Harvey</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/disa.12388</url>
<snippet>Analyses of disaster resilience have focused increasingly on the role of social capital and online social networks in recovery. This study complements this field of work by investigating three key issues. First, it examines how a social messaging application, WeChat, helped individuals to access and to mobilise three types of social capital-bonding, bridging, and linking-during Hurricane Harvey, a Category 4 storm that made landfall in Louisiana and Texas in the United States in August 2017, resulting in significant flooding and loss of life. Second, it pinpoints and assesses quantitatively how individuals' WeChat group usage and social capital influenced their post-disaster well-being. Third, it demonstrates how a minority and immigrant community in Houston, Texas, overcame the disadvantages commonly observed in other disaster research through the utilisation of social media. The findings of this study should aid governmental and community efforts to foster resilience in the face of natural and human-induced hazards.

<title>People are scarier than ghosts? Workplace haters and knowledge sharing</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.13278</url>
<snippet>Objective.In the workplace, colleague relationship deeply affects employees' work attitude and behavior, but it is rarely taken seriously. Based on the cognitive-affective personality system theory and social network theory, this study examined the influence of three common workplace haters (negative gossiper, two-faced person, and loafer) on employee well-being and knowledge sharing and explores the moderating effect of organizational social capital. Method.The study used longitudinal design, three-wave, and 409 valid supervisor-employee pairs (233 direct supervisors and 409 employees) from 10 companies in Taiwan to test these hypothetical relationships. Results. The findings of this study showed that: (1) workplace haters negatively affects employee well-being; (2) employee well-being positively affects knowledge sharing; (3) employee well-being mediates the relationship between workplace haters and knowledge sharing; and (4) organizational social capital moderates the relationship between workplace haters and employee well-being. Conclusion. The study has important contributions to the literature on workplace haters, coworker interaction, and social capital. Implications for behavioral researchers and human resource managers are discussed.

<title>Is the Excessive Use of Microblogs an Internet Addiction? Developing a Scale for Assessing the Excessive Use of Microblogs in Chinese College Students</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0110960</url>
<snippet>More and more college students are using microblogs, with some excessive users demonstrating addiction-like symptoms. However, there is currently no published scale available for use in assessing excessive use of these microblogs, a significant impediment to advancing this area of research. We collected data from 3,047 college students in China and developed a Microblog Excessive Use Scale (MEUS) for Chinese college students, comparing it with criteria used for assessing Internet addiction. Our diagnostic scale featured three factors, two of which-"withdrawal and health problem'' and "time management and performance''-are already included in Internet addiction assessment scales. The third factor, "social comfort,'' does not appear in Internet addiction assessment scales. Our study found that females have significantly higher MEUS scores than males, and that total MEUS scores positively correlated with scores from "self-disclosure'' and `` real social interaction'' scales. These findings differ from results obtained in previous investigations into Internet addiction. Our results indicate that some characteristics of the excessive use of microblogs are different to those of Internet addiction, suggesting that microblog overuse may not correspond exactly to the state of Internet addiction.

<title>Heterosexual Marital Intention: The Influences of Confucianism and Stigma Among Chinese Sexual Minority Women and Men</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-021-02229-9</url>
<snippet>In traditional Confucianist culture in China, marriage and offspring are highly valued, placing sexual minority adults under tremendous pressure to marry an opposite sex partner. This study explored how Confucianism and stigma were associated with the intention to pursue a heterosexual marriage among Chinese sexual minority individuals as well as the moderating mechanisms of gender and age. Cross-sectional data were collected from 747 participants via online social networks from March to June 2020. Items assessed Confucianism values (communalism, filial piety, traditional gender roles); stigma (rejection sensitivity, social discrimination); and heterosexual marital intention (HMI). A total of 1.7&#37; (n = 12) participants had ever been married, 11.6&#37; (n = 87) planned to marry a different-sex partner, 60.4&#37; (n = 451) had no intention to pursue a heterosexual marriage, and 26.4&#37; (n = 197) had no specific marital plan. Bisexual participants scored significantly higher than homosexual individuals in HMI. Sexual minority adults with high levels of Confucianism and stigma were more likely to intend to marry. Importantly, both individual stigma (rejection sensitivity) and interpersonal stigma (social discrimination) partially mediated the relationship between Confucianism and HMI. Confucianism had a stronger impact on HMI for men than women, and age moderated the influence of Confucianism (including communalism and filial piety) on HMI, with a stronger impact for younger than older generations. This study contributes to a better understanding of how Confucianism and stigma may be connected to the intention to pursue a heterosexual marriage, suggesting culture-modified theories of stigma and sexual minority stress are needed to explain the experiences of sexual minority people in contemporary China.

<title>The dual network structure of organizational problem solving: A case study on open source software development</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2012.12.003</url>
<snippet>We reconstruct the dual network structure generated by the association between 72 contributors and 737 software bugs engaged during a full development cycle of the free/open source software project Epiphany. Estimates of structural parameters of Exponential Random Graph Models for two-mode networks reveal the structural logics shaping activities of collaborative problem solving. After controlling for contributor-specific and software bug-specific characteristics, we find that contributors ("problem solvers") tend to distribute their activity over multiple software bugs. At the same time, however, we find that software bugs ("problems") tend not to share multiple contributors. This dual tendency toward de-specialization and exclusivity is sustained by specific local network dependencies revealed by our analysis which also suggests possible organizational mechanisms that may be underlying the puzzling macro-structural regularities frequently observed, but rarely explained, in the production of open source software. By combining these mechanisms with the influence of contributors characterized by different levels of involvement in the project, we provide micro-level evidence of structural interdependence between "core" and "peripheral" members identified exclusively on the basis of their individual level of contribution to the project.

<title>Polarized information ecosystems can reorganize social networks via information cascades</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2102147118</url>
<snippet>The precise mechanisms by which the information ecosystem polarizes society remain elusive. Focusing on political sorting in networks, we develop a computational model that examines how social network structure changes when individuals participate in information cascades, evaluate their behavior, and potentially rewire their connections to others as a result. Individuals follow proattitudinal information sources but are more likely to first hear and react to news shared by their social ties and only later evaluate these reactions by direct reference to the coverage of their preferred source. Reactions to news spread through the network via a complex contagion. Following a cascade, individuals who determine that their participation was driven by a subjectively "unimportant" story adjust their social ties to avoid being misled in the future. In our model, this dynamic leads social networks to politically sort when news outlets differentially report on the same topic, even when individuals do not know others' political identities. Observational follow network data collected on Twitter support this prediction: We find that individuals in more polarized information ecosystems lose cross-ideology social ties at a rate that is higher than predicted by chance. Importantly, our model reveals that these emergent polarized networks are less efficient at diffusing information: Individuals avoid what they believe to be "unimportant" news at the expense of missing out on subjectively "important" news far more frequently. This suggests that "echo chambers"-to the extent that they exist-may not echo so much as silence.

<title>The Power of Social Commerce: Understanding the Role of Social Word-of-Mouth Behaviors and Flow Experience on Social Media Users' Purchase Intention</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440241278452</url>
<snippet>Social commerce has emerged as a phenomenon that supports social interaction and user-generated content, allowing individuals to make informed purchasing decisions. This study aims to identify the antecedents of the sWOM behaviors present in social network sites (SNSs). Specifically, tie strength, homophily, trust, informational, and normative influence were included as sWOM antecedents. This study provides a deeper understanding of sWOM behavior in SNSs by identifying and analyzing separately three interrelated behaviors with distinct antecedents: opinion-giving, opinion-seeking, and opinion-passing. Additionally, flow experience is proposed as a less studied antecedent that interacts with all sWOM behaviors, and simultaneously, purchase intention. Our results suggest that flow experience, followed by opinion-seeking and opinion-passing, exerts the greatest influence on purchase intention. Additionally, our findings reveal that informative and normative influence are the analyzed antecedents that have the greatest impact on purchase intention.JEL Classification: M31. This study analyzes the sequential process of evaluation and use of social networks regarding the intention to purchase products recommended by other consumers. Three types of internet behaviors are differentiated: searching for product information, sharing this information with one's contacts in social networks, and/or generating opinions and evaluations about the products. Several factors have been identified that could enhance both the three aforementioned behaviors and the final purchase intention of the product itself: tie strength, homophily, trust, informative influence, normative influence, and flow experience. The results of the study allow us to conclude that flow experience as well as opinion-seeking and opinion-passing behaviors are the factors that enhance product purchase intention the most. Of the remaining factors analyzed, the effect of informative and normative influences is most significant.

<title>On the validity of perceived social structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2020.102384</url>
<snippet>The validity of survey-based reports of social relationships is a critical assumption for much social network research. Research on informant accuracy has shown that observational data and recalled behavior by informants are imperfectly correlated, which calls into question whether complex relations like friendship and advice-seeking can be accurately measured from individual reports. A class of network inference models, the Bayesian Network Accuracy Models, growing out of the pioneering work of Batchelder and Romney on inference from informant reports, provides a principled basis for inferring network structure given such error-prone data. Using these models, we can gain insight into the accuracy of informants' self and proxy reports of social ties, and more broadly, the reliability and validity of respondents' reports of informal social relations. While existing data does not provide a criterion validity check for inferring most relationships, other notions of validity and/or reliability can still be applied. For instance, if friendship reports are generated from a common underlying network that is perceivable (albeit imperfectly) by all actors, then random subsets of actors should produce estimates that should agree (i.e., split-half reliability). Using informant reports on friendship and advice-seeking networks from four different organizations, we show substantially higher levels of split-half reliability than can be explained by chance, suggesting that models are indeed estimating a common underlying relation. We also show that informants' errors appear to be structured in ways that are consistent with cognitive models of social perception, with greater accuracy on average for large-scale network features rather than fine details, for own versus others' ties, and for core-periphery structures versus bipartitions. Evidence from construct validity checks further suggests the that common networks underlying informants' reports have properties that would be expected of true social structures. Taken together, our findings support the view that informants' mental models of social structure, while error-prone, nevertheless reflect an underlying social reality.

<title>Overcoming Uncertainty in Novel Technologies: The Role of Venture Capital Syndication Networks in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Startup Investments in Korea and Japan</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems12030072</url>
<snippet>This paper investigates how historical inter-firm syndication networks influence venture capitalists' (VCs) propensity to invest in startups pursuing novel, uncertain technologies, with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI). We theorize that VCs' positional attributes within cumulative syndication networks determine their access to external expertise and intelligence that aid AI investment decisions amidst informational opacity. Specifically, reachability to prior AI investors provides referrals and insights transmitted across short network paths to reduce ambiguity. Additionally, VC brokerage between disconnected industry clusters furnishes expansive, non-redundant information that is pivotal for discovering and assessing AI opportunities. Through hypotheses grounded in social network theory, we posit network-based mechanisms that equip VCs to navigate uncertainty when engaging with ambiguous innovations like AI. We test our framework, utilizing comprehensive historical records of global venture capital investments. Analyzing the location information of VC firms in this database, we uncovered a history of 14,751 investments made by Korean and Japanese firms. Using these data, we assembled an imbalanced panel dataset from 1984 to 2022 spanning 230 Korean and 413 Japanese VCs, with 4508 firm-year observations. Negative binomial regression analysis of this dataset reveals how historical relational patterns among venture capital firms foster readiness to evaluate unfamiliar innovations.

<title>The role of geography in the complex diffusion of innovations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-72137-w</url>
<snippet>The urban-rural divide is increasing in modern societies calling for geographical extensions of social influence modelling. Improved understanding of innovation diffusion across locations and through social connections can provide us with new insights into the spread of information, technological progress and economic development. In this work, we analyze the spatial adoption dynamics of iWiW, an Online Social Network (OSN) in Hungary and uncover empirical features about the spatial adoption in social networks. During its entire life cycle from 2002 to 2012, iWiW reached up to 300 million friendship ties of 3 million users. We find that the number of adopters as a function of town population follows a scaling law that reveals a strongly concentrated early adoption in large towns and a less concentrated late adoption. We also discover a strengthening distance decay of spread over the life-cycle indicating high fraction of distant diffusion in early stages but the dominance of local diffusion in late stages. The spreading process is modelled within the Bass diffusion framework that enables us to compare the differential equation version with an agent-based version of the model run on the empirical network. Although both model versions can capture the macro trend of adoption, they have limited capacity to describe the observed trends of urban scaling and distance decay. We find, however that incorporating adoption thresholds, defined by the fraction of social connections that adopt a technology before the individual adopts, improves the network model fit to the urban scaling of early adopters. Controlling for the threshold distribution enables us to eliminate the bias induced by local network structure on predicting local adoption peaks. Finally, we show that geographical features such as distance from the innovation origin and town size influence prediction of adoption peak at local scales in all model specifications.

<title>Self-Esteem Shapes the Impact of GPA and General Health on Facebook Addiction: A Mediation Analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439316656606</url>
<snippet>This study investigates the mediation impact of grade point average (GPA) and general health positive on Facebook addiction via self-esteem (SE) under the provision of active daily use of Facebook. We reached 120 participants who are college students. Our sample comprised 63 (52.5&#37;) females and 57 (47.5&#37;) males. We collected data through an online questionnaire. Structural equation modeling using IBM SPSS AMOS and mediation analysis were performed. The findings of the study suggested that SE is a critical and shaping construct when the decreasing impact of both GPA and general health positive on Facebook addiction is a concern. College students with low GPA and general health-positive feelings have low SE, which in turn increases the possibility of becoming a Facebook addict. Moreover, active daily use of Facebook is another factor triggering addiction. Recommendations and further research studies are presented.

<title>Top management team social capital, digital technology and enterprise innovation performance</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2023.2282067</url>
<snippet>Top management team (TMT) social capital plays an important role in obtaining innovation resources and improving enterprise innovation performance (EIP). However, there are few literatures on the impact of different dimensions of TMT social capital on EIP, especially in the digital era. Taking the listed companies disclosed by Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2008-2019 as samples, based on resource-based view and social network theory, a moderated mediation model is constructed. This paper examines the mechanism of TMT social capital affecting EIP, the mediating role of digital technology and the moderating role of network position. The results show that, TMT overseas capital and academic capital have significant positive effects on EIP; digital technology mediates the relationship between overseas capital, academic capital and EIP; network position moderates the relationship between academic capital and digital technology. Furthermore, the mediating role of digital technology in the relationship between academic capital and EIP is moderated by network position. The research conclusion enriches the research on TMT social capital, digital technology and EIP, and provides helpful guidance for enterprises to make full use of TMT social capital to manage digital technology and improve EIP.

<title>It Takes Two: The Interplay of Individual and Group Theology on Social Embeddedness</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01427.x</url>
<snippet>Prior research argues that religious homophily in social networks is a product of overlapping interests and activities unintentionally leading to relationships or the intentional seeking of relationships with people of similar religious beliefs. This article advances research on religious homophily by including the role that exclusive theological beliefs play in explaining religious homophily among friends. We lay out three propositions for individual-, congregational-, and cross-level effects on the relationship between exclusive theology and embeddedness within one's congregation. Using multilevel models and data from the U.S. Congregational Life Survey (USCLS), we find support for our three propositions. We discuss our findings in terms of how exclusive theologies may contribute to bonding forms of social capital, but limit exposure to diverse social perspectives and bridging forms of social capital.

<title>Homophily and Segregation in Cooperative Networks&lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708142</url>
<snippet>Social networks affect individuals' ability to solve conflicts between individual and collective interests. Indeed, the ability to seek out cooperative others is a key explanation for the high levels of cooperation observed in social life. In contrast to existing research on cooperation and networks, sorting in the real world is typically driven by homophily, or similarity on socially significant attributes like ethnicity or religion. Here the authors develop and test an argument about how homophily alters network dynamics and cooperation using a large web-based experiment and an agent-based model. They find that homophily promotes cooperation, net of key determinants of cooperation. Further, homophily drives the selection of new ties, increasing clustering in dynamic networks. The authors also demonstrate the consequences of in-group preferences for between-group segregation. Their results therefore shed light on how cooperation can evolve in networks and how this process contributes to network-level segregation.

<title>Taking Communities into the Groan Zone: Subjective Wellbeing in the Face of Demographic Change, Racial Diversity, and Political Difference&lt;SUP&gt;☆&lt;/SUP&gt;</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ruso.12472</url>
<snippet>This paper draws from a dataset focusing on two rural communities in Colorado (USA). Data collection occurred over two periods: late-2019 and again during COVID-19 lockdowns in mid-2020. The communities differed demographically: one had a growing minoritized population, especially among its youth; the other was overwhelmingly white. The paper troubles the concept of subjective wellbeing (SWB) as it asks about the productive potentials of discomfort, with assistance from such concepts as colorblind ideology, motivated reasoning, and network homophily. While important to think about so-called positive emotional states in the context of community development, we must also ask questions like, "SWB for who and at whose expense?" How respondents thought about individual- and community-level SWB had much to do with the social networks they were in. I also explore why the community that fared pandemic-related disruptions, from a SWB standpoint, better than the other performed worse during this same period from an economic (material) standpoint. Sociological factors explain these dynamics, which are leveraged to enhance our understanding of how to conceptualize community development in productive ways. In sum, I argue that certain expressions of discomfort have value and are therefore necessary for creating resilient, flourishing, and, ultimately, just communities.

<title>SEDIS-A Rumor Propagation Model for Social Networks by Incorporating the Human Nature of Selection</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems11010012</url>
<snippet>The explosive evolution of the internet has paved the path for the rise of social networks, which can help people connect remotely. Currently, social networks are commonly used for sharing thoughts, feelings, information, and personal life, which vary from individual to individual. The world has witnessed a tremendous increase in social media usage in the last decade, and more people are expected to spend their time online after the COVID-19 pandemic. This increases the rapid propagation of rumors and fake news within societies and communities. On one end, social networks act as an excellent platform for digital marketing and sharing information. However, on the other end, social network rumors and fake news create a significant impact on society, including riots. To study and analyze social network rumors, several mathematical rumor propagation epidemic models have been proposed. The majority are related to disease-spreading epidemic models and reject the human aspect of social selection. This paper introduces a new mathematical rumor propagation model for social networks by incorporating the human psychological aspect of selection as a separate state. Our mathematical analysis and computational simulation proved that the model exists within the system. It was also proven that the system is always non-negative and there always exists a solution in the system. Our implementation of an intervention mechanism within the discrete compartmental model simulation proved the necessity of an effective interference that can help to prevent the implications of uncontrolled rumor dissemination within social networks.

<title>Adoption and adaptation: A computational case study of the spread of Granovetter's weak ties hypothesis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.01.001</url>
<snippet>How do new scientific ideas diffuse? Computational studies reveal how network structures facilitate or obstruct diffusion; qualitative studies demonstrate that diffusion entails the continuous translation and transformation of ideas. This article bridges these computational and qualitative approaches to study diffusion as a complex process of continuous adaptation. As a case study, we analyze the spread of Granovetter's Strength of Weak Ties hypothesis, published in American Journal of Sociology in 1973. Through network analysis, topic modeling and a close reading of a diffusion network created using Web of Science data, we study how different communities in this network interpret and develop Granovetter's hypothesis in distinct ways. We further trace how these communities originate, merge and split, and examine how central scholars emerge as community leaders or brokers in the diffusion process.

<title>Users' participation and social influence during information spreading on Twitter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183290</url>
<snippet>Online Social Networks generate a prodigious wealth of real-time information at an incessant rate. In this paper we study the empirical data that crawled from Twitter to describe the topology and information spreading dynamics of Online Social Networks. We propose a measurement with three measures to state the efforts of users on Twitter to get their information spreading, based on the unique mechanisms for information retransmission on Twitter. It is noticed that small fraction of users with special performance on participation can gain great influence, while most other users play a role as middleware during the information propagation. Thus a community analysis is performed and four categories of users are found with different kinds of participation that cause the information dissemination dynamics. These suggest that exiting topological measures alone may reflect little about the influence of individuals and provide new insights for information spreading.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-17135-1</url>
<snippet>Online social networks have increasing influence on our society, they may play decisive roles in politics and can be crucial for the fate of companies. Such services compete with each other and some may even break down rapidly. Using social network datasets we show the main factors leading to such a dramatic collapse. At early stage mostly the loosely bound users disappear, later collective effects play the main role leading to cascading failures. We present a theory based on a generalised threshold model to explain the findings and show how the collapse time can be estimated in advance using the dynamics of the churning users. Our results shed light to possible mechanisms of instabilities in other competing social processes.

<title>Cyberbullying severity detection: A machine learning approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240924</url>
<snippet>With widespread usage of online social networks and its popularity, social networking platforms have given us incalculable opportunities than ever before, and its benefits are undeniable. Despite benefits, people may be humiliated, insulted, bullied, and harassed by anonymous users, strangers, or peers. In this study, we have proposed a cyberbullying detection framework to generate features from Twitter content by leveraging a pointwise mutual information technique. Based on these features, we developed a supervised machine learning solution for cyberbullying detection and multi-class categorization of its severity in Twitter. In the study we applied Embedding, Sentiment, and Lexicon features along with PMI-semantic orientation. Extracted features were applied with Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine algorithms. Results from experiments with our proposed framework in a multi-class setting are promising both with respect to Kappa, classifier accuracy and f-measure metrics, as well as in a binary setting. These results indicate that our proposed framework provides a feasible solution to detect cyberbullying behavior and its severity in online social networks. Finally, we compared the results of proposed and baseline features with other machine learning algorithms. Findings of the comparison indicate the significance of the proposed features in cyberbullying detection.

<title>Digital inequalities and why they matter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1012532</url>
<snippet>While the field of digital inequality continues to expand in many directions, the relationship between digital inequalities and other forms of inequality has yet to be fully appreciated. This article invites social scientists in and outside the field of digital media studies to attend to digital inequality, both as a substantive problem and as a methodological concern. The authors present current research on multiple aspects of digital inequality, defined expansively in terms of access, usage, skills, and self-perceptions, as well as future lines of research. Each of the contributions makes the case that digital inequality deserves a place alongside more traditional forms of inequality in the twenty-first century pantheon of inequalities. Digital inequality should not be only the preserve of specialists but should make its way into the work of social scientists concerned with a broad range of outcomes connected to life chances and life trajectories. As we argue, the significance of digital inequalities is clear across a broad range of individual-level and macro-level domains, including life course, gender, race, and class, as well as health care, politics, economic activity, and social capital.

Herein we use a combination of graph theoretic and spatial approaches to describe the roost and social network characteristics and foraging associations of an Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) maternity colony in an agricultural landscape in Ohio, USA. We tracked 46 bats to 50 roosts (423 total relocations) and collected 2,306 foraging locations for 40 bats during the summers of 2009 and 2010. We found the colony roosting network was highly centralized in both years and that roost and social networks differed significantly from random networks. Roost and social network structure also differed substantially between years. Social network structure appeared to be unrelated to segregation of roosts between age classes. For bats whose individual foraging ranges were calculated, many shared foraging space with at least one other bat. Compared across all possible bat dyads, 47&#37; and 43&#37; of the dyads showed more than expected overlap of foraging areas in 2009 and 2010 respectively. Colony roosting area differed between years, but the roosting area centroid shifted only 332 m. In contrast, whole colony foraging area use was similar between years. Random roost removal simulations suggest that Indiana bat colonies may be robust to loss of a limited number of roosts but may respond differently from year to year. Our study emphasizes the utility of graphic theoretic and spatial approaches for examining the sociality and roosting behavior of bats. Detailed knowledge of the relationships between social and spatial aspects of bat ecology could greatly increase conservation effectiveness by allowing more structured approaches to roost and habitat retention for tree-roosting, socially-aggregating bat species.

<title>The Rise of Fashion Informatics: A Case of Data-Mining-Based Social Network Analysis in Fashion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0887302X18821187</url>
<snippet>With the advent of modern cognitive computing technologies, fashion informatics researchers contribute to the academic and professional discussion about how a large-scale data set is able to reshape the fashion industry. Data-mining-based social network analysis is a promising area of fashion informatics to investigate relations and information flow among fashion units. By adopting this pragmatic approach, we provide dynamic network visualizations of the case of Paris Fashion Week. Three time periods were researched to monitor the formulation and mobilization of social media users' discussions of the event. Initial textual data on social media were crawled, converted, calculated, and visualized by Python and Gephi. The most influential nodes (hashtags) that function as junctions and the distinct hashtag communities were identified and represented visually as graphs. The relations between the contextual clusters and the role of junctions in linking these clusters were investigated and interpreted.

<title>Physician Connectedness and Referral Choice</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obes.12525</url>
<snippet>This study examines the effects of social network structure of intermediaries in health care, namely referring physicians, upon the specialty treatment choices of patients in the United States. The social network of a referring physician is identified by the patient-sharing pattern in Medicare claims data, and the following three measures are employed as key explanatory variables: (1) number of physicians connected (adjusted degree); (2) tightness of the network (clustering coefficient); and (3) influence of individual physicians in the network (eigenvector centrality). The results of discrete-choice demand models suggest that if patients are referred by a physician who is a more important player in their social networks (i.e. eigenvector centrality is higher), the patient has a higher chance of choosing a surgeon of better quality.

<title>Are older adults networked individuals? Insights from East Yorkers' network structure, relational autonomy, and digital media use</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1428659</url>
<snippet>Networked individualism is a critical concept about the transition of the societal shift from geographically bounded local groups to the contemporary network society comprised of sparse, permeable, and dynamic communication networks. An underlying assumption about networked individuals thus far in the literature is that they are at a younger age. There are fears that older adults have been left behind in this transition to networked individualism. In this study, we are the first to inquire to what extent and in what ways are older adults networked individuals. Using in-depth interviews with 41 older adults living in the East York area of Toronto, we used a combination of quantitative coding, thematic analysis, and individual profiling to analyze their social network structure, relational autonomy, and digital media use. Our findings render a rather complex and nuanced picture, showing three types of older adults along the spectrum of networked individualism: networked individuals, socially connected but not networked individuals, and socially constrained individuals. Although most participants are socially connected, those who are networked individuals actively manage and navigate multiple, diverse, and non-redundant social networks. Digital media use is neither necessary nor sufficient in qualifying a person as a networked individual as the great majority of East Yorkers even if not networked individuals integrate digital media into their everyday lives.

<title>Research disciplinary interactions on scientific collaboration network in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution: Characteristics and dynamics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266404</url>
<snippet>Interdisciplinary scientific collaboration promotes the innovative development of scientific research. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) is a typical interdisciplinary subject. This study aims to explore the characteristics of discipline interaction and the temporal evolution in the field. Bibliometric analysis could be used to understand the stage of research in a particular subject. In this work, the publications on the topic in Web of Science (WoS) platform from 1999 to 2020 were selected. On the basis of social network theory, the characteristics of interdisciplinary were revealed from three perspectives. First, the disciplinary interaction network is constructed through disciplinary co-occurrence to detect the characteristics of interaction structure among different disciplines. Then the node centrality index is employed to explore the influence of disciplines in the interactive network by using network centrality analysis. Moreover, the dynamic of discipline interaction evolution is studied using blockmodeling analysis. In the field of PHE, the number of disciplines and the intensity of interaction among different subjects gradually increased in the past 20 years. Chemistry and Material Sciences are the core discipline, and they play an important role in the network. The whole network is divided into different discipline groups. The scale of the discipline group is becoming large, and the disciplinary interaction is becoming more complex. The obtained results are helpful for guiding scholars to carry out interdisciplinary interaction. The methods of detecting interdisciplinary interactive relationship could provide paths for interdisciplinary research in other fields.

<title>The role of gender in social network organization</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189873</url>
<snippet>The digital traces we leave behind when engaging with the modern world offer an interesting lens through which we study behavioral patterns as expression of gender. Although gender differentiation has been observed in a number of settings, the majority of studies focus on a single data stream in isolation. Here we use a dataset of high resolution data collected using mobile phones, as well as detailed questionnaires, to study gender differences in a large cohort. We consider mobility behavior and individual personality traits among a group of more than 800 university students. We also investigate interactions among them expressed via person-to-person contacts, interactions on online social networks, and telecommunication. Thus, we are able to study the differences between male and female behavior captured through a multitude of channels for a single cohort. We find that while the two genders are similar in a number of aspects, there are robust deviations that include multiple facets of social interactions, suggesting the existence of inherent behavioral differences. Finally, we quantify how aspects of an individual's characteristics and social behavior reveals their gender by posing it as a classification problem. We ask: How well can we distinguish between male and female study participants based on behavior alone? Which behavioral features are most predictive?

<title>White matter connectivity in brain networks supporting social and affective processing predicts real-world social network characteristics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03655-8</url>
<snippet>Human behavior is embedded in social networks. Certain characteristics of the positions that people occupy within these networks appear to be stable within individuals. Such traits likely stem in part from individual differences in how people tend to think and behave, which may be driven by individual differences in the neuroanatomy supporting socio-affective processing. To investigate this possibility, we reconstructed the full social networks of three graduate student cohorts (N = 275; N = 279; N = 285), a subset of whom (N = 112) underwent diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Although no single tract in isolation appears to be necessary or sufficient to predict social network characteristics, distributed patterns of white matter microstructural integrity in brain networks supporting social and affective processing predict eigenvector centrality (how well-connected someone is to well-connected others) and brokerage (how much one connects otherwise unconnected others). Thus, where individuals sit in their real-world social networks is reflected in their structural brain networks. More broadly, these results suggest that the application of data-driven methods to neuroimaging data can be a promising approach to investigate how brains shape and are shaped by individuals' positions in their real-world social networks. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging reveals that students' standing in their real-world social networks is reflected in patterns of brain network connectivity.

<title>The Company You Keep: How Network Disciplinary Diversity Enhances the Productivity of Researchers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642221127242</url>
<snippet>The Covid-19 pandemic has affected most organizations' working environment and productivity. Organizations have had to make arrangements for staff to operate remotely following the implementation of lockdown regulations around the world, as the pandemic has led to restrictions on movement and the temporary closure of workplace premises. The purpose of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of the effect of this transition on productivity during the pandemic, by studying a distributed network of research who collaborate remotely. We examine how the productivity of researchers is affected by the distributed collaborative networks in which they are embedded. Our goal is to understand the effects of brokerage and closure on the researchers' publication rate, which is interpreted as an indicator of their productivity. We analyze researchers' communication networks, focusing on structural holes and diversity. We take into account the individual qualities of the focal researcher such as seniority. We find that disciplinary diversity among researchers' peers increases the researchers' productivity, lending support to the brokerage argument. In addition, we find support for two statistical interaction effects. First, structural holes moderate diversity so that researchers with diverse networks are more productive when their networks also have a less redundant structure. Diversity and structural holes, when combined, further researchers' productivity. Second, seniority moderates diversity such that senior researchers are more productive than junior researchers in less diverse networks. In more diverse networks, junior researchers perform as well as senior researchers. Social capital and human capital are complementary. We conclude that the benefits of diversity on researchers' productivity are contingent on the qualities of the researchers and on network structure. The brokerage/closure debate thus needs a more nuanced understanding of causal relationships.

<title>Testing the validity of social capital measures in the study of information and communication technologies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2014.884612</url>
<snippet>Social capital has been considered a cause and consequence of various uses of new information and communication technologies (ICTs). However, there is a growing divergence between how social capital is commonly measured in the study of ICTs and how it is measured in other fields. This departure raises questions about the validity of some of the most widely cited studies of social capital and ICTs. We compare the Internet Social Capital Scales (ISCS) developed by Williams [2006. On and off the 'net: scales for social capital in an online era. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 11(2), 593-628. doi: 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00029.x] - a series of psychometric scales commonly used to measure 'social capital' - to established, structural measures of social capital: name, position, and resource generators. Based on a survey of 880 undergraduate students (the population to which the ISCS has been most frequently administered), we find that, unlike structural measures, the ISCS does not distinguish between the distinct constructs of bonding and bridging social capital. The ISCS does not have convergent validity with structural measures of bonding or bridging social capital; it does not measure the same concept as structural measures. The ISCS conflates social capital with the related constructs of social support and attachment. The ISCS does not measure perceived or actual social capital. These findings raise concerns about the interpretations of existing studies of 'social capital' and ICTs that are based on the ISCS. Given the absence of measurement validity, we urge those studying social capital to abandon the ISCS in favor of alternative approaches.

<title>Modeling influence on posting engagement in online social networks: Beyond neighborhood effects</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.05.005</url>
<snippet>In many online social networks (OSN), Member A can observe the online participation of Member B and thus may be exposed to a shift in the online participation of B. Such exposure is often modeled by a neighbor-to-neighbor spreading process that can lead to local influence. In other words, exposure to participation shifts of Neighbor B can exert local influence on A's posting engagement. Since many posts nowadays are public rather than private, exposure to participation shifts of non-neighbors outside A's neighborhood can exert global influence on A's posting engagement. We model influence spread in an OSN by differentiating between exposure to participation shifts of local and global influence sources. The results of applying the proposed model to different temporal dynamic OSNs show evidence of both local and global influence on posting engagement of members. This consideration of global influence in OSNs, beyond neighborhood effects, extends past research that focused mainly on local influence and provides new insights about influence sources in general and viral marketing in particular.

<title>Topic Classification Using Regularized Variable-Size CNN and Dynamic BPSO in Online Social Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13369-023-08021-2</url>
<snippet>Topic classification is an important problem in an online social network (OSN). Many recent works on convolutional neural network (CNN) machine learning (ML) algorithms for topic classification have been proposed, their performance was mostly limited due to the inappropriate selection of hyperparameters, such as batch size, number of filters, number of epochs, learning rate, etc. Though CNN-based binary particle swarm optimization (CNN-BPSO) is one of the possible solutions for finding the suitable values of hyperparameters, it suffers from overfitting issues and leads to high loss value. In this context, we propose a novel regularized variable-size CNN-based dynamic binary particle swarm optimization (RVCNN-DBPSO) framework to overcome the above limitations. In this work, tweets are pre-processed and mapped to the existing pre-trained fastText word embedding technique to extract the vector representation. Subsequently, these vectors are used in our framework to classify the tweets into eight categories: accident, business, education, entertainment, cricket, health, politics, and sports. Our framework uses DBPSO to model the values of hyperparameters in the form of particles using the binary encoding technique and select a particle that results in appropriate values of hyperparameters. The performance evaluation of the proposed framework has been carried out on 2.2 million labelled tweets and three public datasets, and it has been compared with CNN-BPSO, CNN, RVCNN, and other machine learning classifiers. Results show that the proposed framework performs better in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-Score and also solves the overfitting issues while minimizing the loss compared with the existing frameworks.

<title>Netville online and offline - Observing and surveying a wired suburb</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027649921955290</url>
<snippet>Since the mid-1850s, scholars have debated how technological innovation would affect community. The debate continues as the Internet makes it increasingly possible for people to socialize, shop, work, learn, and participate in leisure activities all from within their home. Will the movement of these previously public activities into the private realm lead to reduced participation in public activities? What will be the fate of community and social relations as a result of the growth of computer-mediated communication? Netville is a suburban Toronto development equipped with a high-speed network as part of its design. The clustering of homes within this area allowed us to study the social networks, civic involvement, Internet use, and attitudes of residents. This article explores the research approach of the Netville project and describes its main sources of data collection: surveys collected using computer assisted interviewing and ethnographic fieldwork.

<title>HOW LONG IS A TWEET? MAPPING DYNAMIC CONVERSATION NETWORKS ON &lt;i&gt;TWITTER&lt;/i&gt; USING GAWK AND GEPHI</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2011.635214</url>
<snippet>Twitter is now well established as the world's second most important social media platform, after Facebook. Its 140-character updates are designed for brief messaging, and its network structures are kept relatively flat and simple: messages from users are either public and visible to all (even to unregistered visitors using the Twitter website), or private and visible only to approved 'followers' of the sender; there are no more complex definitions of degrees of connection (family, friends, friends of friends) as they are available in other social networks. Over time, Twitter users have developed simple, but effective mechanisms for working around these limitations: '#hashtags', which enable the manual or automatic collation of all tweets containing the same #hashtag, as well allowing users to subscribe to content feeds that contain only those tweets which feature specific #hashtags; and '@replies', which allow senders to direct public messages even to users whom they do not already follow. This paper documents a methodology for extracting public Twitter activity data around specific #hashtags, and for processing these data in order to analyse and visualize the @reply networks existing between participating users - both overall, as a static network, and over time, to highlight the dynamic structure of @reply conversations. Such visualizations enable us to highlight the shifting roles played by individual participants, as well as the response of the overall #hashtag community to new stimuli - such as the entry of new participants or the availability of new information. Over longer timeframes, it is also possible to identify different phases in the overall discussion, or the formation of distinct clusters of preferentially interacting participants.

<title>Spatial distance and mobile business social network density</title>

<snippet>Following the increasing adoption of mobile communication, scholars have shown interest in the role of place on the structure of mobile social networks. The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between spatial distance and the closure and diversity of businesses mobile social networks. We used a database that aggregates actual mobile communication patterns of business users of a large Israeli cell phone company (n=16,199). Our findings, among a large sample of businesses, provide support for the place and mobile communication perspective. The results reveal a negative association between spatial distance and mobile business communication networks. As spatial distance between business network members increases, business social ties through mobile communication decreases. Furthermore, the results also revealed a negative association between spatial distance and mobile network density. As the spatial distance between business users increases, the density of the mobile communication network diminishes. Physical proximity promotes the development of dense business networks. The implications of the findings are discussed.

<snippet>This study aims to construct a theoretical framework to analyze the elements of the network structure and the relationship system within the seafood supply chain. The scope of the investigation is to evaluate how these elements influence the flow of products and the efficiency of the seafood supply chain and why these social interactions can create value and enhance competitive advantage. The model combines the resource- and knowledge-based view and the social network analysis applied to seafood supply chains. To demonstrate the application of the model, two theoretical examples and a real case study of the Mercado del Mar in Guadalajara, Mexico, are used. Primary data are obtained from semi-structured interviews, social network analysis metrics, and qualitative analysis. Findings are based on the analysis of theoretical examples and must be considered with caution. Nevertheless, the observations in the examples and case study provide new arguments to the relationship between the pattern of interrelationship and the efficiency of a supply chain. This study emphasizes the necessity of combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to understand and explain real-life supply networks.

<title>Mutual assent or unilateral nomination? A performance comparison of intersection and union rules for integrating self-reports of social relationships</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.05.005</url>
<snippet>Data collection designs for social network studies frequently involve asking both parties to a potential relationship to report on the presence of absence of that relationship, resulting in two measurements per potential tie. When inferring the underlying network, is it better to estimate the tie as present only when both parties report it as present or do so when either reports it? Employing several data sets in which network structure can be well-determined from large numbers of informant reports, we examine the performance of these two simple rules. Our analysis shows better results for mutual assent across all data sets examined. A theoretical analysis of estimator performance shows that the best rule depends on both underlying error rates and the sparsity of the underlying network, with sparsity driving the superiority of mutual assent in typical social network settings.

<snippet>The aim of this qualitative research was to examine the dynamics of existing and emerging social networks among Latino survivors of Hurricane Katrina. Data were generated through individual, in-depth interviews conducted with 65 Latinos within six months of the storm striking the Gulf Coast of the United States in August 2005. The findings illustrated both the role of social networks in gathering information, making decisions and accessing resources, and how these existing social networks were disrupted and strained by overwhelming needs. Broader structural issues, including poverty and a lack of transportation, combined with marginalised status as immigrants, further constrained access to essential information and resources. In response, new, if temporary, social networks emerged, based primarily on shared nationality, language, and a sense of collective commitment. Practice implications include the need to consider the social network dynamics of marginalised groups in developing innovative strategies to overcome structural barriers to accessing resources essential for disaster preparedness and survival.

We test six mechanisms of tie formation on face-to-face positive (affect/esteem) and negative (dislike/disesteem) networks of 282 university students. While popularity, activity, and entrainment are present in both networks, closure, reciprocity, and homophily are largely absent from negative tie networks. We argue this arises because avoidance is inherent to negative sentiments. Avoidance reduces information transfer through negative ties and short-circuits cumulative causation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

<snippet>This article examines the scope of pro-Kremlin disinformation about Crimea. I deploy content analysis and a social network approach to analyze tweets related to the region. I find that pro-Kremlin disinformation partially penetrated the Twitter debates about Crimea. However, these disinformation narratives are accompanied by a much larger wave of information that disagrees with the disinformation and are less prevalent in relative terms. The impact of Russian state-controlled news outlets-which are frequent sources of pro-Kremlin disinformation-is concentrated in one, highly popular news outlet, RT. The few, popular Russian news media have to compete with many popular Western media outlets. As a result, the combined impact of Russian state-controlled outlets is relatively low when comparing to its Western alternatives.

<snippet>The prospects for online social networks as sites of information-gathering and affiliation for persons with AIDS and others concerned about HIV/AIDS not only represent the latest development in a trend toward circumventing traditional media and official information sources, but also may offer hope for a revitalization of HIV/AIDS discourse in the public sphere. This article provides an overview of three decades of information-seeking on the pandemic and its social and personal implications, as well as case studies of three examples of social networking surrounding HIV/AIDS. It finds preliminary evidence of the formation of strong and weak ties as described in Social Network Theory and suggests that the online accumulation of social capital by opinion leaders could facilitate dissemination of messages on HIV/AIDS awareness and testing.

<title>'A Whole New World': Mothers' Technologically Mediated Leisure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490400.2015.1043414</url>
<snippet>This study explored the roles of an online social networking site called Momstown.ca as a form of technologically mediated leisure in mothers' experiences of online connections. Active interviews with 22members of Momstown.ca revealed that mothers encounter limiting ideologies of motherhood reinforced through the separation of the public and private spheres. This separation constructs mothers' experiences as less visible, less socially relevant, and confined within private spaces. Through mothers' technologically mediated leisure, the public and private spheres were blurred and ideologies of motherhood were both reinforced and resisted. Mothers demonstrated distinct social dynamics through their mediated leisure suggesting the cyberfeminist potential for transformations in public discourse and private practice that may uniquely contribute to alleviating the contemporary challenges of mothers' increased social isolation and an anxiety-inducing culture.

<title>Emerging Digital Generations? Impacts of Child Digital Use on Mental and Socioemotional Well-Being across Two Cohorts in Ireland, 2007-2018</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12187-020-09767-z</url>
<snippet>Despite the growing body of literature on how digital technologies impact child well-being, previous research has provided little evidence on recent digital trends. This paper examines the patterns and effects of digital use on child socioemotional well-being across two cohorts of children grown up ten years apart during the 'digital age': the 1998 cohort (interviewed in 2007/08) and the 2008 cohort (interviewed in 2017/18). Multivariate linear regression models were conducted for these two cohorts from the Growing Up in Ireland (GUI) study, a multi-cohort longitudinal study with rich comparable data on a large sample of 9-year olds (N = 13,203). Results show that (i) in 2017/18 children were more active in digital devices and social media, while in 2007/2008 children spent more time watching TV and adopted less diversified forms of media engagement; (ii) spending more than 3 daily hours on TV/digital activities was associated with significant declines in child socioemotional well-being, while such effects were stronger in 2017/18 than in 2007/08; (iii) media engagement (but not other forms of digital engagement) was associated with moderate declines in socioemotional well-being, both in 2007/08 and in 2017/18; (iv) while children's media and digital engagement differed by the child gender and socioeconomic background, none of these variables moderated the effects of digital use on children's socioemotional well-being, neither in 2007/08 nor in 2017/18. Overall, the study reveals persistence, but also some important changes, in recent trends on children's digital use and its impact on socioemotional well-being in Ireland.

<title>Social influence and interaction bias can drive emergent behavioural specialization and modular social networks across systems</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2019.0564</url>
<snippet>In social systems ranging from ant colonies to human society, behavioural specialization-consistent individual differences in behaviour-is commonplace: individuals can specialize in the tasks they perform (division of labour (DOL)), the political behaviour they exhibit (political polarization) or the non-task behaviours they exhibit (personalities). Across these contexts, behavioural specialization often co-occurs with modular and assortative social networks, such that individuals tend to associate with others that have the same behavioural specialization. This raises the question of whether a common mechanism could drive co-emergent behavioural specialization and social network structure across contexts. To investigate this question, here we extend a model of self-organized DOL to account for social influence and interaction bias among individuals-social dynamics that have been shown to drive political polarization. We find that these same social dynamics can also drive emergent DOL by forming a feedback loop that reinforces behavioural differences between individuals, a feedback loop that is impacted by group size. Moreover, this feedback loop also results in modular and assortative social network structure, whereby individuals associate strongly with those performing the same task. Our findings suggest that DOL and political polarization-two social phenomena not typically considered together-may actually share a common social mechanism. This mechanism may result in social organization in many contexts beyond task performance and political behaviour.

<title>Emotion shapes the diffusion of moralized content in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1618923114</url>
<snippet>Political debate concerning moralized issues is increasingly common in online social networks. However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks, a process we call "moral contagion." Using a large sample of social media communications about three polarizing moral/political issues (n = 563,312), we observed that the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20&#37; for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them. Our results highlight the importance of emotion in the social transmission of moral ideas and also demonstrate the utility of social network methods for studying morality. These findings offer insights into how people are exposed to moral and political ideas through social networks, thus expanding models of social influence and group polarization as people become increasingly immersed in social media networks.

<title>REACHING CITIZENS ONLINE How youth organizations are evolving their web presence</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2011.572982</url>
<snippet>Keeping in mind the potential consequences that digital communication may hold for democratic societies, this research focuses on better understanding the web presence of UK youth organizations. It is interesting to examine how such organizations tie their theoretical conception of citizenship (their 'offline' philosophy) to the choices they make about web presence (their 'online' structure). Web presence in this case, websites but also the use of Web 2.0 applications - can aim to provide information and promote participation, but can also encourage a particular view of citizenship and use certain forms of communication to advance this view. This paper focuses on seven youth organizations that embrace either a more conventional or non-conventional view of citizenship and have expanded their web presence from a dedicated website into Web 2.0, particularly social networking sites. First, I will summarize interview findings with web producers to better understand the philosophy behind web presence of the youth organization, along with a look at official website content. Second, I will provide a first look at how such organizations have adapted to Web 2.0, specifically via Facebook and Twitter. This paper contributes to an understanding of how online spaces and in particular the adaptation to Web 2.0 reflect offline views towards citizenship, a particularly important focus in an environment of increasing concern as to how to reach youth via technology.

<title>Drivers of hate speech in political conversations on Twitter: the case of the 2022 Italian general election</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-024-00501-1</url>
<snippet>We study the prevalence and characteristics of toxic speech on Twitter in the run-up to the 2022 Italian General election. We analyzed over 8.5 M tweets shared by 450k unique users and employed a machine learning classifier to estimate the toxicity score of their messages. We found that supporters of different political coalitions exhibit varying levels of toxic speech, sending between 6-8&#37; of toxic messages overall. Notably, Centre-Left politicians received more toxic messages on average, with the largest target of hate receiving over 15,000 toxic replies. We employed Generalized Linear Models to study factors that drive hate speech to political targets, finding that, importantly, politicians employing more abusive and harmful language are also more likely to attract more inflammatory speech. Our findings underscore the critical need for targeted interventions to address hate speech online, fostering healthier dialogue and safeguarding democratic discourse.

<title>The use of Twitter by state leaders and its impact on the public during the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05540</url>
<snippet>The article examines how many leaders used Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic, in what way, and the impact they had on the public. In the context of Twitter, the impact on the public refers to the growth in followers as it signifies the increased interest of the public about information. 50,872 tweets were collected from 143 state leaders and an original dataset was created containing information on the growth of followers. Ordinary least squares regression models were used for the analysis. It was found that 64.8&#37; of UN member states had a leader that tweeted about COVID-19. Furthermore, a significant increase in the number of followers during the pandemic compared to months prior was noted. Since March, the pandemic has been a dominant topic on Twitter. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest percentage increase in gaining Twitter followers was experienced by politicians who frequently tweeted and those who had a lower ratio of the number of followers to internet users. The research implies that citizens are interested in being informed about emergencies through social networks, and government officials should use them.

<title>Cascades Across Networks are Sufficient for the Formation of Echo Chambers: An Agent-Based Model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4566</url>
<snippet>Investigating how echo chambers emerge in social networks is increasingly crucial, given their role in facilitating the retention of misinformation, inducing intolerance towards opposing views, and misleading public and political discourse. Previously, the emergence of echo chambers has been attributed to psychological biases and inter-individual differences, requiring repeated interactions among network-users and rewiring or pruning of socialties. Using an idealised population of social network users, the present results suggest that when combined with positive credibility perceptions of a communicating source, social media users' ability to rapidly share information with each other through a single cascade can be sufficient to produce echo chambers. Crucially, we show that this requires neither special psychological explanation (e.g., bias or individual differences), nor repeated interactions-though these may be exacerbating factors. In fact, this effect is made increasingly worse the more generations of peer-to-peer transmissions it takes for information to permeate a network. This raises important questions for social network architects, if truly opposed to the increasing prevalence of deleterious societal trends that stem from echo chamber formation.

<title>The role of social network structure and function in moderate and severe social and emotional loneliness: The Dutch SaNAE study in older adults</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e23734</url>
<snippet>Background: Loneliness is a serious public health problem. This became even more visible during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the key social network aspects contributing to loneliness remain unknown. Here, we evaluated social network structure and function and associations with (moderate/severe) social and emotional loneliness in older adults. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes online questionnaire data (SaNAE cohort, August-November 2020), in independently living Dutch adults aged 40 years and older. For the separate outcomes of social and emotional loneliness, associations with structural social network aspects (e.g., network diversity - having various types of relationships, and density - network members who know each other), and functional social network aspects (informational, emotional, and practical social support) were assessed and risk estimates were adjusted for age, educational level, level or urbanization, comorbidities, and network size. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were stratified by sex. Results: Of 3396 participants (55 &#37; men; mean age 65 years), 18 &#37; were socially lonely which was associated with a less diverse and less dense network, living alone, feeling less connected to friends, not having a club membership, and fewer emotional supporters (men only) or informational supporters (women only). 28 &#37; were emotionally lonely, which was associated with being socially lonely, and more exclusively online (versus in-person) contacts (men only), and fewer emotional supporters (women only). Conclusion: Network structure and function beyond the mere number of contacts is key in loneliness. Public health strategies to prevent loneliness in older adults should be sex-tailored and promote network diversity and density, club membership, informational and emotional support, and in-person contact.

<title>Product development team formation: effects of organizational- and product-related factors</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-019-09302-8</url>
<snippet>Although the performance of new product development (PD) is dependent on the structure and formation of design teams, effective configuration of the PD teams remains largely unexplored. According to social network research, teams are often organized in either closely connected or sparse structure. We conceptualize PD projects as collective problem-solving endeavors and develop a computational model of these projects where a number of designers conduct search over an NK(C) performance landscape. We group the designers in teams with closely connected or sparse structure. We also consider various organizational integration capabilities (i.e., coordinated operations, and common principles) as well as interaction networks among the teams (i.e., acyclical, cyclical, and modular). We use simulation and compare the design performance of teams with different configurations. Our results indicate that the extent by which organizations can effectively integrate design solutions determines the team structure and is likely to result in higher development performance. In addition, the design performance of strategies that employ both closely connected and sparse teams is contrasted with the strategies that use either of these structures. Regardless of the integration capabilities of the PD projects, strategies that simultaneously utilize both closely connected and sparse teams are likely to achieve higher development performance than strategies that only use teams with one particular structure.

<title>Destination eWOM: A macro and meso network approach?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2017.02.007</url>
<snippet>The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework that describes the characteristics and the underlying drivers of publically shared electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) for destinations. Tweets about a destination were collected while the destination hosted a hallmark event over a 5-year period (2011-2015). In each year, interactions on Twitter were analysed using macro and meso-level social network analysis to identify the network structure and hubs of eWOM activity. A K means clustering algorithm was then applied to create clusters of nodes with similar characteristics and eWOM content within each cluster was analysed using automated content analysis. The resulting model indicates that destination and event eWOM maintains a macro network structure in which a small number of accounts or hubs influence information sharing. Hub characteristics evolve over time, whereas eWOM content can fluctuate in response to emergent destination activities. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

<title>Big Data and Political Social Networks: Introducing Audience Diversity and Communication Connector Bridging Measures in Social Network Theory</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439315617262</url>
<snippet>Social media have changed the way citizens, journalists, institutions, and activists communicate about social and political issues. However, questions remain about how information is diffused through these networks and the degree to which each of these actors is influential in communicating information. In this study, we introduce two novel social network measures of connection and information diffusion that help shed light on patterns of political communication online. The Audience Diversity Score assesses the diversity of a particular actor's followers and identifies which actors reach different publics with their messages. The Communication Connector Bridging Score highlights the most influential actors in the network who are potentially able to connect different spheres of communication through their information diffusion. We apply and discuss these measures using Twitter data from the discussion regarding the Transatlantic Trade Investment Partnership in Europe. Our results provide unique insights into the role various actors play in diffusing political information in online social networks.

<title>Opinion transmission in organizations: an agent-based modeling approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-013-9161-2</url>
<snippet>This paper builds a theoretical framework to detect the conditions under which social influence enables persistence of a shared opinion among members of an organization over time, despite membership turnover. It develops agent-based simulations of opinion evolution in an advice network, whereby opinion is defined in the broad sense of shared understandings on a matter that is relevant for an organization's activities, and on which members have some degree of discretion. We combine a micro-level model of social influence that builds on the "relative agreement" approach of Deffuant et al. (J. Artif. Soc. Simul. 5:4, 2002), and a macro-level structure of interactions that includes a flow of joiners and leavers and allows for criteria of advice tie formation derived from, and grounded in, the empirical literature on intra-organizational networks. We provide computational evidence that persistence of opinions over time is possible in an organization with joiners and leavers, a result that depends on circumstances defined by mode of network tie formation (in particular, criteria for selection of advisors), individual attributes of agents (openness of newcomers to influence, as part of their socialization process), and time-related factors (turnover rate, which regulates the flow of entry and exit in the organization, and establishes a form of endogenous hierarchy based on length of stay). We explore the combined effects of these factors and discuss their implications.

<title>Practical Methods for Imputing Follower Count Dynamics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0049124120926210</url>
<snippet>Microblogging sites have become important data sources for studying network dynamics and information transmission. Both areas of study, however, require accurate counts of indegree, or follower counts; unfortunately, collection of complete time series on follower counts can be limited by application programming interface constraints, system failures, or temporal constraints. In addition, there is almost always a time difference between the point at which follower counts are queried and the time a user posts a tweet. Here, we consider the use of three classes of simple, easily implemented methods for follower imputation: polynomial functions, splines, and generalized linear models. We evaluate the performance of each method via a case study of accounts from 236 health organizations during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. For accurate interpolation and extrapolation, we find that negative binomial regression, modeled separately for each account, using time as an interval variable, accurately recovers missing values while retaining narrow prediction intervals.

<title>The Role of ICT in Maintaining Social Cohesion: Understanding the Potential of Digital Initiatives for Social Networks in Rural Areas&lt;SUP&gt;☆&lt;/SUP&gt;</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ruso.12557</url>
<snippet>Digital initiatives may have helped to maintain active social networks during restrictive, social distancing measures of the COVID-19 pandemic. To examine how and under which circumstances digital initiatives can contribute to social cohesion, semistructured interviews with 35 stakeholders of local communities and clubs were conducted. The thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews identified four main themes, characterizing conditions under which digital initiatives successfully contributed to social cohesion. First, preexisting digital routines need to be considered. Information and communications technology (ICT) routines, even if limited, need to be extended for digital initiatives to be successfully integrated into communities. Second, acquiring ICT skills are not a technical but a social problem. Members with limited prior knowledge relied heavily on strong ties to improve their ICT skills to become part of digital networks. Third, social media fatigue is particularly prevalent in those with limited prior ICT experience. Importantly, individual withdrawal from digital networks, resulting from SMF, had a knock-on effect on others. Finally, communities that were not engaging with ICT dissipated. As such, ICT may contribute to social capital by maintaining social engagement in social networks, particularly if providing additional benefits to the community.

<title>Using an Agent-Based Model to Simulate the Development of Risk Behaviors During Adolescence</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Adolescents tend to adopt behaviors that are similar to those of their friends, and also tend to become friends with peers that have similar interests and behaviors. This tendency towards homogeneity applies not only to conventional behaviors such as working for school and participating in sports activities, but also to risk behaviors such as drug use, oppositional behavior or unsafe sex. The current study aims at building an agent model to answer the following related questions: How do friendship groups evolve and what is the role of behavioral similarity in friendship formation? How does homogeneity among peers emerge, with regard to conventional as well as risk behaviors? On the basis of the theoretical and empirical literature on friendship selection and influences on risk behavior during adolescence we first developed a conceptual framework, which was then translated into a mathematical model of a dynamic system and implemented as an agent-based computer simulation consisting of simple behavioral rules and principles. Each agent in the model holds distinct property matrices including an individual behavioral profile with a list of risky (i.e., alcohol use, aggressiveness, soft drugs) and conventional behaviors (i.e., school attendance, sports, work). The computer model simulates the development, during one school year, of a social network (i.e. formation of friendships and cliques), the (dyadic) interactions between pupils and their behavioral profiles. During the course of simulation, the agents' behavioral profiles change on the basis of their interactions resulting in individual developmental curves of conventional and risk behaviors. These profiles are used to calculate the (behavioral) similarity and differences between the various agents. Generally, the model output is analyzed by means of visual inspection (i.e., plotting developmental curves of behavior and social networks), systematic comparison and by calculating additional measures (i.e., using specific social analysis software packages). Simulation results conclusively indicate model validity. The model simulates qualitative properties currently found in research on adolescent development, namely the role of homophily, the appearance of friendship clusters, and the increase in behavioral homogeneity among friends. The model not only converges with empirical findings, but furthermore helps to explain social psychological phenomena (e.g. the emergence of homophily among adolescents).

<title>Selectivity in posting on social networks: the role of privacy concerns, social capital, and technical literacy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03298</url>
<snippet>People's posting behaviors in social networks was perceived as ambiguous, with concerns misaligned with people's public postings. To address this gap, we suggest a model that offers new insights into the relationship between perceptions and actual behaviors. We define a quantitative marker for agility, the frequency in which people update their audience selection when posting information in online social networks, and evaluate the factors that contribute to the variability of agility between different users. We analyzed the posting behavior of Facebook 181 participants, as well as their answers to open and close questions. We find that frequent changes in privacy settings are correlated with high social privacy and with institutional privacy concerns, whereas social concerns were found to be more prominent. Agility was negatively correlated with low public sharing. Our findings show that users use privacy settings to effectively mitigate privacy concerns and desires for creating and strengthening social connections. We discuss how agility can be used to design and to evaluate new user interfaces for managing privacy in social settings.

<title>Long-term Fluctuations in Polarization in Brazil - Analysis of Political Information Sharing Between 2011 and 2019</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/dados.2023.66.2.287</url>
<snippet>The specialized literature on the polarization of political information circulation within digital media has pointed to the structural segregation of news consumption along the ideological spectrum. These findings support the idea of relatively stable filter bubbles encapsulating the vision of the political world. This research questions whether these patterns hold long-term or are conditioned by moments of high tension, such as national elections. To this end, it quantitatively investigates the links cited in 7.7 million Facebook posts between 2011 and 2019 by the site's pages with social networking analysis techniques within left-wing and right-wing clusters. The results highlight polarization dynamics that are not airtight - that instead fluctuate according to the layout of the political system. Its main contribution is that it demonstrates the nuances of polarization: identifying not necessarily segregated poles but temporal, political, and media factors that arouse and calm information insularity.

<title>Online political participation, civic talk, and media multiplexity: how Taiwanese citizens express political opinions on the Web</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2013.833278</url>
<snippet>This study seeks to assess the implications of the social use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for online political participation. Past research investigating the link between ICTs and political participation has emphasized the informational use of ICTs, overlooking their communication-enabling potentials for facilitating political talk in interpersonal spaces and subsequently, political participation in public domains. To understand further how ICTs as a means of communication may relate to political participation, we use data from the 2008 Taiwan Social Change Survey (N=1076) to examine the relationship between the Internet and online political participation by looking at online media use for social interaction and engagement in civic talk online. Our findings suggest that interpersonal factors such as online civic talk and media multiplexity are positively associated with online political participation. Individuals who discuss politics with their friends via the Internet and those who use more types of online media for social interaction are more likely to contact legislators and elected officials directly via the Web and articulate their political thoughts in online public spaces such as forums, blogs, and websites of news media. We further offer an assessment of the findings' implications for political participation, political communication, and digital inequality.

<title>Online volunteering and subjective well-being in China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03676-0</url>
<snippet>This study aims to examine the relationship between online volunteering and subjective well-being (SWB) and to explore the mediation effect of online bridging networks. The data used in this study came from the 2019 Chinese General Social Survey (CSS). In this study, individuals who responded to survey questions about their participation in online volunteering activities and their subjective well-being(SWB) were included for analysis (N = 5556). The results showed a positive relationship between online volunteering and online bridging networks and indicated that online volunteering affects subjective well-being through the mediating role of online bridging networks. The implications of this study are relevant to policy-makers in public health and social service organizations. Based on the findings, policy-makers and nonprofit organizations are called on to support this type of volunteering which is an important means of improving public health. Nonprofit organizations can establish online social networks for potential volunteers. In addition, nonprofit organizations need to invest more resources to enhance the digital literacy of employees and volunteers, in order to enhance the quality of online volunteering services.

<title>Sustainable development goals as unifying narratives in large UK firms' Twitter discussions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34024-y</url>
<snippet>To achieve sustainable development worldwide, the United Nations set 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for humanity to reach by 2030. Society is involved in the challenge, with firms playing a crucial role. Thus, a key question is to what extent firms engage with the SDGs. Efforts to map firms' contributions have mainly focused on analysing companies' reports based on limited samples and non-real-time data. We present a novel interdisciplinary approach based on analysing big data from an online social network (Twitter) with complex network methods from statistical physics. By doing so, we provide a comprehensive and nearly real-time picture of firms' engagement with SDGs. Results show that: (1) SDGs themes tie conversations among major UK firms together; (2) the social dimension is predominant; (3) the attention to different SDGs themes varies depending on the community and sector firms belong to; (4) stakeholder engagement is higher on posts related to global challenges compared to general ones; (5) large UK companies and stakeholders generally behave differently from Italian ones. This paper provides theoretical contributions and practical implications relevant to firms, policymakers and management education. Most importantly, it provides a novel tool and a set of keywords to monitor the influence of the private sector on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.

<title>The Use of Enterprise Social Network Sites for Knowledge Sharing in Distributed Organizations: The Role of Organizational Affordances</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764214540510</url>
<snippet>Enterprise social network sites (ESNSs) are increasingly being introduced into large multinational organizations. In this article, we consider their potential for supporting knowledge-sharing practices within the organization. First, we build on prior work on affordances by applying notions of collective affordances and affordances for organizing to the study of social media, and we theorize how ESNSs may provide organizational affordances for knowledge sharing in distributed multinational organizations in particular. Second, we articulate ways in which ESNS affordances may shape knowledge sharing through consideration of social capital dynamics, support for relationships and interactions, context collapse, and network interactions. Finally, and building on these ideas, we propose a research agenda and suggestions for future research on this topic.

<title>Patterns of ties in problem-solving networks and their dynamic properties</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75221-3</url>
<snippet>Understanding the functions carried out by network subgraphs is important to revealing the organizing principles of diverse complex networks. Here, we study this question in the context of collaborative problem-solving, which is central to a variety of domains from engineering and medicine to economics and social planning. We analyze the frequency of all three- and four-node subgraphs in diverse real problem-solving networks. The results reveal a strong association between a dynamic property of network subgraphs-synchronizability-and the frequency and significance of these subgraphs in problem-solving networks. In particular, we show that highly-synchronizable subgraphs are overrepresented in the networks, while poorly-synchronizable subgraphs are underrepresented, suggesting that dynamical properties affect their prevalence, and thus the global structure of networks. We propose the possibility that selective pressures that favor more synchronizable subgraphs could account for their abundance in problem-solving networks. The empirical results also show that unrelated problem-solving networks display very similar local network structure, implying that network subgraphs could represent organizational routines that enable better coordination and control of problem-solving activities. The findings could also have potential implications in understanding the functionality of network subgraphs in other information-processing networks, including biological and social networks.

<title>Emergent social cohesion for coping with community disruptions in disasters</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2019.0778</url>
<snippet>Social cohesion is an important determinant of community well-being, especially in times of distress such as disasters. This study investigates the phenomena of emergent social cohesion, which is characterized by abrupt, temporary and extensive social ties with the goal of sharing and receiving information regarding a particular event influencing a community. In the context of disasters, emergent social cohesion, enabled by social media usage, could play a significant role in improving the ability of communities to cope with disruptions in recent disasters. In this study, we employed a network reticulation framework to examine the underlying mechanisms influencing emergent social cohesion on social media while communities cope with disaster-induced disruptions. We analysed neighbourhood-tagged social media data (social media data whose users are tagged by neighbourhoods) in Houston, TX, USA, during Hurricane Harvey to characterize four modalities of network reticulation (i.e. enactment, activation, reticulation and performance) giving rise to emergent social cohesion. Our results show that, unlike regular social cohesion, communication history and physical proximity do not significantly affect emergent social cohesion. The results also indicate that weak social ties play an important role in bridging different social network communities, and hence reinforce emergent social cohesion. The findings can inform public officials, emergency managers and decision-makers regarding the important role of neighbourhood-tagged social media, as a new form of community infrastructure, for improving the ability of communities to cope with disaster disruptions through enhanced emergent social cohesion.

<title>The gender of social capital</title>

<snippet>Legitimacy affects returns to social capital. I begin with the network structure of social capital, explaining the information and control benefits of structural holes. The holes in a network are entrepreneurial opportunities to add value, and persons rich in such opportunities are expected to be more successful than their peers. Accumulating empirical research supports the prediction. However, women here pose a puzzle. The entrepreneurial networks linked to early promotion for senior men do not work for women. Solving the gender puzzle is an occasion to see how network models of social capital can be used to identify people not accepted as legitimate members of a population, and to describe how such people get access to social capital by borrowing the network of a strategic partner.

<title>A NOVEL MODEL FOR RUMOR SPREADING ON SOCIAL NETWORKS WITH CONSIDERING THE INFLUENCE OF DISSENTING OPINIONS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S021952591850011X</url>
<snippet>Rumor spreading is a good sample of spreading in which human beings are the main players in the spreading process. Therefore, in order to have a more realistic model of rumor spreading on online social networks, the influence of psycho-sociological factors particularly those which affect users' reactions toward rumor/anti-rumor should be considered. To this aim, we present a new model that considers the influence of dissenting opinions on those users who have already believed in rumor/anti-rumor but have not spread the rumor/anti-rumor yet. We hypothesize that influence is a motive for the believers to spread their beliefs in rumor/anti-rumor. We derive the stochastic equations of the new model and evaluate it by using two real datasets of rumor spreading on Twitter. The evaluation results support the new hypothesis and show that the novel model which is relied on the new hypothesis is able to better represent rumor spreading.

<title>WHO SCHEDULES ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS? The case of Twitter in the movement #&lt;i&gt;YoSoy132&lt;/i&gt; in Mexico</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/ris.2013.05.29</url>
<snippet>The article discusses the latest hypothesis that social networks and Internet social influence is spontaneous and accidental, which contradicts the old hypothesis of the initial programming of all social movements from a previously defined strategic influence. The discussion starts from analyzing of the most influential players in the movement #YoSoy132 on social network Twitter in Mexico.

<title>What Drives Sustainable Brand Awareness: Exploring the Cognitive Symmetry between Brand Strategy and Consumer Brand Knowledge</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12020198</url>
<snippet>The explosive development of social media has given great opportunities to academic and industry research on consumer brand knowledge. Particularly, the brand associative network has been most frequently used to describe consumer brand knowledge structure. However, few researchers have examined the embedded connotation of the brand knowledge structural measurement in regard to sustainable brand performance and adjusted their brand strategies accordingly. Combining psychological cognitive theory and the network analytic method, this paper aims to extend this area by investigating the relationship between brand structural position in consumers' associative knowledge network and sustainable brand awareness. Using a monthly dataset of around 130 million user posts, we find that compared to a prior determined brand strategy, brand network centrality in consumer's brand associative knowledge network shows a much more significant positive effect on sustainable brand awareness. Importantly, we further examined the symmetric matching of brand positioning strategy and consumer's brand knowledge structure for sustainable brand awareness. We find that sustainable brand awareness will be promoted by a symmetric matching brand positioning strategy with its position in the associative knowledge work. Our study facilitates an understanding of brands based on consumer perceptions for managers and enables businesses to adjust their relevant strategies for the achievement of sustainable brand performance.

<title>Diffusion dynamics and digital movement: The emergence and proliferation of the German-speaking #FridaysForFuture network on twitter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2023.2211015</url>
<snippet>Diffusion is a long-established concept that deals with the mechanisms explaining the prevalence of social movements. However, previous empirical studies on digital movement merely used diffusion as a term referring to increasing numbers of posts or public attention, without distinguishing what is diffused nor asking how information is diffused. Studies applying social network analysis have restricted themselves to retweet networks from a static perspective and emphasized the main actors and critical messages driven by the crowds. While the previous studies examined information diffusion as an outcome, they were unable to reveal the underlying processes that define how digitally networked movements spread over time among crowds embedded in different communities. As a case study, this paper investigates how the German-speaking network #FridaysForFuture was facilitated and contested through different diffusion dynamics. By inferring a diffusion network based on 237,892 retweeting sequences and the following/follower relationships of the 51,803 engaged actors in the early stages of #FridaysForFuture, it quantifies the digitally networked movement from a top-down perspective: the network, the tweets, and the retweets, concerning aspects of both actor and content. The findings suggest the development of digitally networked movements depends on their ability to influence and spread among different networked publics. The diffusion mechanisms of information, discourses, and beliefs of digitally networked movements were mainly enabled by, and flowed through, pre-existing networks rather than situational spontaneity. However, they varied according to issue salience and were distinguished by the network structures, political positions, ideological lines, and geographical proximities of the involved communities.

<title>Social cohesion and knowledge diffusion: understanding the embeddedness-homophily association</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwu024</url>
<snippet>The idea of social relations shaping business and production relations between economic agents is not new. Production relations may become socially embedded and may exhibit homophily. We work towards understanding an embeddedness-homophily connection with the support of a case study of the decline of a formerly dominant handloom weavers' community in Kerala, the Saliyars. We demonstrate that there is a spectrum of cohesion along which network links can be categorised, and that it is homophilous-embeddedness that truly defines cohesion. We build the evidence that the Saliyars' networks were characterised by 'homophilous-embeddedness', which, we show, has been relayed across generations. Due to this attribute, the Saliyars are placed as an example that counters the standard line in the literature that community cohesion has been historically congruent to technological progress and knowledge diffusion in handloom in India.

<title>The influence of network structure and prosocial cultural norms on charitable giving: A multilevel analysis of Movember's fundraising campaigns in 24 countries</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.04.001</url>
<snippet>This study examines how the interplay between an online campaign's network structure and prosocial cultural norms in a country affect charitable giving. We conducted a multilevel analysis that includes Twitter network and aggregated donation data from the 2013 Movember fundraising campaigns in 24 countries during 62 campaign days. Prosocial cultural norms did not affect the relationship between network size and average donations raised, nor did they affect the relationship between network centralization and average donation amount. Prosocial cultural norms did affect the relationship between network density and average donations raised. However, this effect was negative and contrary to our expectation.

<title>Social influence or selection? Peer effects on the development of adolescents' educational expectations in Germany</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01425692.2020.1763163</url>
<snippet>Educational expectations are a key predictor of educational attainment. Throughout adolescence, friends increasingly function as 'significant others' and, thus, can affect the development of these expectations. Although scholars often interpret the clustering of students with similar expectations within friendship networks as the outcome of peer influence, a similarity of friends can also be a result of friendship selection processes and preselection due to ability tracking. We apply multilevel social network models to panel data of adolescents from Germany (1,992 ninth-grade students in 91 classes) to disentangle these mechanisms. Beyond selecting similar friends (homophily), we find that adolescents adapt their expectations towards the average expectations of their friends (social influence) but only in secondary-school tracks that support diverse educational paths. We conclude that peer socialization is important for the development of students' educational expectations in contexts that are sufficiently heterogeneous to allow for the emergence of distinct peer milieus.

<title>It takes two: A dyadic model of recruitment to civic activity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.07.008</url>
<snippet>Why are some people, but not others, asked to engage in civic activity? Rather than focus on the personal traits of either potential recruits or recruiters for this initial stage of recruitment, we develop and test a theoretical framework that emphasizes the importance of shared relationships and characteristics between those doing the recruiting and those being recruited. Specifically, the nature of interactions, overlapping community and associational space, status and value homophily, and strength and intimacy are assessed to explain differential recruitment among people's closest ties. Furthermore, unlike previous studies, we do so across three different forms of civic activity blood donation, volunteer work, and political activism allowing us to identify larger patterns in civic solicitation. Results from multilevel analyses of dyads reorganized from ego-centric data of U.S. adults show that while certain personal traits of egos and alters remain significant, attributes of the dyad are equally, if not more, consequential for explaining variation in who gets asked to participate in civic activity. Importantly, while certain dyadic characteristics such as romantic partnerships promote recruitment to all three forms of civic activity, the effects of others such as sex homophily are unique to specific forms. Broadly speaking, our results indicate that some types of dyadic characteristics are more powerful than others and that there are important differences in how particular dimensions of social connections shape recruitment efforts across the specific activities of donating blood, volunteering time, and engaging in political activism.

<title>Game Changer: The Topology of Creativity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/681213</url>
<snippet>This article examines the sociological factors that explain why some creative teams are able to produce game changers-cultural products that stand out as distinctive while also being critically recognized as outstanding. The authors build on work pointing to structural folding-the network property of a cohesive group whose membership overlaps with that of another cohesive group. They hypothesize that the effects of structural folding on game changing success are especially strong when overlapping groups are cognitively distant. Measuring social distance separately from cognitive distance and distinctiveness independently from critical acclaim, the authors test their hypothesis about structural folding and cognitive diversity by analyzing team reassembly for 12,422 video games and the career histories of 139,727 video game developers. When combined with cognitive distance, structural folding channels and mobilizes a productive tension of rules, roles, and codes that promotes successful innovation. In addition to serving as pipes and prisms, network ties are also the source of tools and tensions.

<title>&lt;i&gt;Guanxi&lt;/i&gt; 2.0: the exchange of &lt;i&gt;likes&lt;/i&gt; in social networking sites</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2020.1748091</url>
<snippet>Few studies have examined how non-verbal functions are implicated in online communication and in non-Western contexts. Addressing these lacunae, this article analyzes interviews with Hong Kong youth to interrogate how likes are exchanged in online interactions within the context of guanxi. This article discovers that likes are reimagined as a digital gift of renqing representing targeted attention from specific giver-identities that generates circuits of likes exchanged between participants for tie-maintenance and tie-formation. For weak ties, lower frequency of reciprocity and sense of obligation were reported, whereas strong ties engendered reports of higher frequency of reciprocity and sense of obligation. However, across all dyadic guanxi ties, participants felt a constant renqing debt demanding repayment. As such, participants felt the need for some baseline frequency of like exchange and offended when alters neglected reciprocity altogether, yet continued giving likes for fear of damaging their reputation and relationship. Thus, mianzi is reconceptualized as embedded in interpersonal evaluations of one's reputation based on how well they maintain relationships and bound up in the social interactive tendency to exchange renqing over time. These webs of meaning and exchange encircle the objective of maintaining relationships by invigorating their emotional content. Here, the non-verbality of likes deepened their ability to replicate the raw, emotive charge of renqing: stripped of the burdensome complexities of verbal communication, likes convey a simple, one-dimensional, powerful sentiment of agreement that, in participants' experiences, is useful to generating future exchanges of likes and improving online relationships enough to create relationships offline as well.

<title>Intervention Strategies and the Diffusion of Collective Behavior</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.2872</url>
<snippet>This paper examines the intervention strategies for the diffusion of collective behavior, such as promoting innovation adoption and repressing a strike. An intervention strategy refers to controlling the behaviors of a small number of individuals in terms of their social or personal attributes, including connectivity (i.e., the number of social ties one holds), motivation (i.e., an individual's intrinsic cost-benefit judgment on behavior change), and sensitivity (i.e., the degree to which one follows others). Extensive agent-based simulations demonstrate that the optimal strategy fundamentally depends on the goal and time of intervention. Moreover, the nature of the social network (determined by homophily type and level) moderates the effectiveness of a strategy. These results have substantial implications for the design and evaluation of intervention programs.

<title>An End-to-End Rumor Detection Model Based on Feature Aggregation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/6659430</url>
<snippet>The social network has become the primary medium of rumor propagation. Moreover, manual identification of rumors is extremely time-consuming and laborious. It is crucial to identify rumors automatically. Machine learning technology is widely implemented in the identification and detection of misinformation on social networks. However, the traditional machine learning methods profoundly rely on feature engineering and domain knowledge, and the learning ability of temporal features is insufficient. Furthermore, the features used by the deep learning method based on natural language processing are heavily limited. Therefore, it is of great significance and practical value to study the rumor detection method independent of feature engineering and effectively aggregate heterogeneous features to adapt to the complex and variable social network. In this paper, a deep neural network- (DNN-) based feature aggregation modeling method is proposed, which makes full use of the knowledge of propagation pattern feature and text content feature of social network event without feature engineering and domain knowledge. The experimental results show that the feature aggregation model has achieved 94.4&#37; of accuracy as the best performance in recent works.

<title>STRATEGIC IMAGE MANAGEMENT ONLINE: Self-presentation, self-esteem and social network perspectives</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2013.763834</url>
<snippet>Communication technology is challenging traditional self-presentation strategies and behavior. Deliberate image construction is becoming more difficult because of the increasing number of information sources about individuals online. The present study examines a range of self-presentation behaviors on social network sites (SNS) by drawing on impression motivation, contingencies of self-worth, and the analysis of social network structure. Results from the survey data show that users (N=248) who stake their self-esteem on public evaluations and have heterogeneous social networks are more strategic in the management of tagged photos and text-based updates in the form of wall posts. Furthermore, the interaction between network size and diversity predicts how often users share photos. Implications for improving privacy management tools on SNS and educating users about strategic self-presentation are discussed.

<title>You are who your friends are? An experiment on homophily in trustworthiness among friends</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1043463120919380</url>
<snippet>We study the existence of homophily (i.e. the tendency for people to be friends with people who are similar to themselves) with respect to trustworthiness. We ask whether two friends show similarly trustworthy behavior toward strangers, and whether such behavior is expected by a third party. We develop a simple model of Bayesian learning in trust games and test the derived hypotheses in a controlled laboratory environment. In the experiment, two trustees sequentially play a trust game with the same trustor, where the trustees depending on treatment are either friends or strangers to each other. We confirm the existence of homophily with respect to trustworthiness. The trustors' beliefs about the trustees' trustfulness are not affected by the knowledge about the (non-)existent friendship between the trustees. Behaviorally, however, they indirectly reciprocate the (un-)trustworthy behavior of one trustee toward his or her friends in later interactions.

<title>Characterizing polarization in online vaccine discourse-A large-scale study</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263746</url>
<snippet>Vaccine hesitancy is currently recognized by the WHO as a major threat to global health. Recently, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in the role of social media in the propagation of false information and fringe narratives regarding vaccination. Using a sample of approximately 60 billion tweets, we conduct a large-scale analysis of the vaccine discourse on Twitter. We use methods from deep learning and transfer learning to estimate the vaccine sentiments expressed in tweets, then categorize individual-level user attitude towards vaccines. Drawing on an interaction graph representing mutual interactions between users, we analyze the interplay between vaccine stances, interaction network, and the information sources shared by users in vaccine-related contexts. We find that strongly anti-vaccine users frequently share content from sources of a commercial nature; typically sources which sell alternative health products for profit. An interesting aspect of this finding is that concerns regarding commercial conflicts of interests are often cited as one of the major factors in vaccine hesitancy. Further, we show that the debate is highly polarized, in the sense that users with similar stances on vaccination interact preferentially with one another. Extending this insight, we provide evidence of an epistemic echo chamber effect, where users are exposed to highly dissimilar sources of vaccine information, depending the vaccination stance of their contacts. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding and addressing vaccine mis- and dis-information in the context in which they are disseminated in social networks.

We find that socioeconomic similarity is a significant predictor of this connectivity metric, which we call "linkage strength": neighborhoods that are similar to one another in terms of residents' median income, education level, and (to a lesser extent) immigration history are more strongly connected in terms of the of people who spend time there, indicating some level of homophily in the way that individuals choose to move throughout a city's districts.

<title>The effects of Internet use on adolescents' first romantic and sexual relationships in Taiwan</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0268580914538084</url>
<snippet>Internet use and digital networking are increasingly an integral part of adolescents' social lives. This study examines the influences of Internet use in Taiwan on two important adolescent social behaviors: first romantic relationship and sexual debut. Using data from the Taiwan Youth Project (TYP), 2000-2009, the results of event history analyses suggest that adolescents' Internet use for educational purposes reduces the rates of having a first romantic relationship and a sexual debut in adolescence, whereas using the Internet for social networking, visiting internet cafes, and surfing pornographic websites increase the rates. There are gender differences in the effects of these Internet activities on adolescents' intimate experiences. Logistic analyses further show that Internet activities also affect the likelihood of whether adolescents have a sexual debut before a first romantic relationship. The implications of these findings are discussed in the conclusion.

<title>Digital cloning of online social networks for language-sensitive agent-based modeling of misinformation spread</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0304889</url>
<snippet>We develop a simulation framework for studying misinformation spread within online social networks that blends agent-based modeling and natural language processing techniques. While many other agent-based simulations exist in this space, questions over their fidelity and generalization to existing networks in part hinder their ability to drive policy-relevant decision making. To partially address these concerns, we create a 'digital clone' of a known misinformation sharing network by downloading social media histories for over ten thousand of its users. We parse these histories to both extract the structure of the network and model the nuanced ways in which information is shared and spread among its members. Unlike many other agent-based methods in this space, information sharing between users in our framework is sensitive to topic of discussion, user preferences, and online community dynamics. To evaluate the fidelity of our method, we seed our cloned network with a set of posts recorded in the base network and compare propagation dynamics between the two, observing reasonable agreement across the twin networks over a variety of metrics. Lastly, we explore how the cloned network may serve as a flexible, low-cost testbed for misinformation countermeasure evaluation and red teaming analysis. We hope the tools explored here augment existing efforts in the space and unlock new opportunities for misinformation countermeasure evaluation, a field that may become increasingly important to consider with the anticipated rise of misinformation campaigns fueled by generative artificial intelligence.

<title>Is the Use of Digital Social Networks Associated with Conspiracy Theories? Evidence from Spain's Andalusian Society</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.5477/cis/reis.173.101</url>
<snippet>This work examines the relationship between the use of social networks and the extent to which populations support certain conspiracy theories, within the context of a Spanish region. Results suggest an association between a higher level of social network use and an increased degree of support for at least 3 of the 4 considered conspiracy theories. Multivariate analysis also reveals that social networking is significant in all cases, but certain sociodemographic, political and psychosocial variables are involved and may play a specific role in each considered case. It has been concluded that follow-up and additional studies are necessary to ensure a greater understanding of this relationship.

<title>Using Blogs as a Teaching Tool in Negotiation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1571-9979.2008.00210.x</url>
<snippet>This article reports on the experimental use of blogs as a teaching tool in a course on negotiation and mediation. The blogs were of two kinds: individual "journal" blogs accessible only by the student author and the course instructor, and a class or collective blog, accessible by all members of the course. The use of blogs builds on the familiar use of journals as a tool for reflection and personal review and adopts the technology of online communication with which the student body is increasingly familiar and comfortable. The article reports on the student response to this development and the perceived impact on extended peer-to-peer communication, cooperation, and skills development. This note also briefly places this experiment in the wider context of the widespread use of blogging, online social networking, and - more ambitiously - the promotion of critical and deliberative skills through the use of information communications technology.

<title>Understanding and countering the spread of conspiracy theories in social networks: Evidence from epidemiological models of Twitter data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256179</url>
<snippet>Conspiracy theories in social networks are considered to have adverse effects on individuals' compliance with public health measures in the context of a pandemic situation. A deeper understanding of how conspiracy theories propagate through social networks is critical for the development of countermeasures. The present work focuses on a novel approach to characterize the propagation of conspiracy theories through social networks by applying epidemiological models to Twitter data. A Twitter dataset was searched for tweets containing hashtags indicating belief in the "5GCoronavirus" conspiracy theory, which states that the COVID-19 pandemic is a result of, or enhanced by, the enrollment of the 5G mobile network. Despite the absence of any scientific evidence, the "5GCoronavirus" conspiracy theory propagated rapidly through Twitter, beginning at the end of January, followed by a peak at the beginning of April, and ceasing/disappearing approximately at the end of June 2020. An epidemic SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model was fitted to this time series with acceptable model fit, indicating parallels between the propagation of conspiracy theories in social networks and infectious diseases. Extended SIR models were used to simulate the effects that two specific countermeasures, fact-checking and tweet-deletion, could have had on the propagation of the conspiracy theory. Our simulations indicate that fact-checking is an effective mechanism in an early stage of conspiracy theory diffusion, while tweet-deletion shows only moderate efficacy but is less time-sensitive. More generally, an early response is critical to gain control over the spread of conspiracy theories through social networks. We conclude that an early response combined with strong fact-checking and a moderate level of deletion of problematic posts is a promising strategy to fight conspiracy theories in social networks. Results are discussed with respect to their theoretical validity and generalizability.

<title>Protecting infrastructure performance from disinformation attacks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16832-w</url>
<snippet>Disinformation campaigns are prevalent, affecting vaccination coverage, creating uncertainty in election results, and causing supply chain disruptions, among others. Unfortunately, the problems of misinformation and disinformation are exacerbated due to the wide availability of online platforms and social networks. Naturally, these emerging disinformation networks could lead users to engage with critical infrastructure systems in harmful ways, leading to broader adverse impacts. One such example involves the spread of false pricing information, which causes drastic and sudden changes in user commodity consumption behavior, leading to shortages. Given this, it is critical to address the following related questions: (i) How can we monitor the evolution of disinformation dissemination and its projected impacts on commodity consumption? (ii) What effects do the mitigation efforts of human intermediaries have on the performance of the infrastructure network subject to disinformation campaigns? (iii) How can we manage infrastructure network operations and counter disinformation in concert to avoid shortages and satisfy user demands? To answer these questions, we develop a hybrid approach that integrates an epidemiological model of disinformation spread (based on a susceptible-infectious-recovered model, or SIR) with an efficient mixed-integer programming optimization model for infrastructure network performance. The goal of the optimization model is to determine the best protection and response actions against disinformation to minimize the general shortage of commodities at different nodes over time. The proposed model is illustrated with a case study involving a subset of the western US interconnection grid located in Los Angeles County in California.

<title>Expanding the measurement of culture with a sample of two billion humans</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2022.0085</url>
<snippet>Culture has played a pivotal role in human evolution. Yet, the ability of social scientists to study culture is limited by the currently available measurement instruments. Scholars of culture must regularly choose between scalable but sparse survey-based methods or restricted but rich ethnographic methods. Here, we demonstrate that massive online social networks can advance the study of human culture by providing quantitative, scalable and high-resolution measurement of behaviourally revealed cultural values and preferences. We employ data across nearly 60 000 topic dimensions drawn from two billion Facebook users across 225 countries and territories. We first validate that cultural distances calculated from this measurement instrument correspond to traditional survey-based and objective measures of cross-national cultural differences. We then demonstrate that this expanded measure enables rich insight into the cultural landscape globally at previously impossible resolution. We analyse the importance of national borders in shaping culture and compare subnational divisiveness with gender divisiveness across countries. Our measure enables detailed investigation into the geopolitical stability of countries, social cleavages within small- and large-scale human groups, the integration of migrant populations and the disaffection of certain population groups from the political process, among myriad other potential future applications.

<title>EFFECTIVENESS OF OPINION INFLUENCE APPROACHES IN HIGHLY CLUSTERED ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219525914500088</url>
<snippet>A mathematical model was developed for opinion propagation on online social networks using a scale-free network with an adjustable clustering coefficient. Connected nodes influence each other when the difference between their opinion values is less than a threshold value. The model is used to examine effectiveness of three different approaches for influencing public opinion. The approaches examined include (1) a "Class", defined as an approach (such as a class or book) that greatly influences a small, randomly selected portion of the population, (2) an "Advertisement", defined as an approach (such as a TV or online advertisement) that has a small influence at each viewing on a large randomly selected portion of the population, and (3) an "App", defined as an approach (such as a Facebook game or smartphone "App") that spreads via the online social network (rather than randomly) and has a small influence at each viewing on the affected population. The Class and Advertisement approaches result in similar overall influence on the population, despite the fact that these approaches are highly different. In contrast, the App approach has a much more significant effect on opinion values of users occupying clusters within the social network compared to the overall population.

<title>TOWARDS CROSS-PLATFORM VALUE CREATION Four patterns of circulation and control</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2012.680483</url>
<snippet>Old media companies are being challenged by new structures of relating content to other 'value' creators, both within the controlled channels of the company and outside the companies' own channels. On the basis of two ethnographic case studies of cross-platform production at a commercial regional newspaper ( now media house) and a non-commercial public service broadcaster, the article identifies four main content flow structures that form part of the strategic challenges of the companies: Create and Play, in which the company maintains control and ownership over the content; Discover and Link, in which the company releases the content from its context, but retains ownership; Fetch and Distribute, in which the company is deprived of control and ownership over the content; and finally Open and Play, in which the users, in various ways, produce the content and the communications framework. The content flow structures constitute a common basis for cross-platform strategic analysis across non-commercial and commercial old media companies, and various understandings of 'value' and change related to these structures are discussed in the article.

<title>Inequality Preservation through Uneven Diffusion of Cultural Materials across Stratified Groups</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/sou101</url>
<snippet>Inequality between groups is frequently maintained through the construction and legitimation of inter-group cultural differences. I draw on Blau's multiform heterogeneity and complex contagion models to theorize and develop a relational mechanism that shows how inequality can be preserved when additional, new bases of differentiating between groups layer over existing ones. I investigate the conditions under which variations in the distribution of the population across stratified groups and homophily of social networks along the stratifying attribute interact in such a way that a belief/practice diffuses widely in one group but not the other-an outcome referred to as differential diffusion. I also analyze how size of ego networks and adoption thresholds affect differential diffusion. Using mathematical and agent-based models, I find a positive correlation between adoption thresholds and homophily: when social networks are highly homophilous (e.g., race and socioeconomic class), uneven diffusion of non-normative behavior reproduces inequality; inclusive networks (e.g., in diverse city schools), in contrast, reestablish inequality through differential diffusion of low-risk behavior. This suggests that cultivating diversity is likely to mitigate inequality preservation in conservative situations where adoption of new beliefs/practices needs considerable affirmation. Encouraging status-based solidarity is more appropriate in receptive contexts where adoption of new behaviors entails comparatively lower risk. The results also imply that analyses of diffusion need to be sensitive to contextual factors, including homophily, cultural institutionalization of the diffusing material, and population distribution. Finally, I extend Ridgeway's seminal work to show how relational structure can not only construct status hierarchies but also contribute to their symbolic maintenance.

<title>Positive algorithmic bias cannot stop fragmentation in homophilic networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2020.1818078</url>
<snippet>Fragmentation, echo chambers, and their amelioration in social networks have been a growing concern in the academic and non-academic world. This paper shows how, under the assumption of homophily, echo chambers and fragmentation are system-immanent phenomena of highly flexible social networks, even under ideal conditions for heterogeneity. We achieve this by finding an analytical, network-based solution to the Schelling model and by proving that weak ties do not hinder the process. Furthermore, we derive that no level of positive algorithmic bias in the form of rewiring is capable of preventing fragmentation and its effect on reducing the fragmentation speed is negligible.

<title>Social network effects on academic achievement</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2017.06.001</url>
<snippet>How peer groups contribute to educational outcomes has long interested researchers. However, the possibility that peer groups dominated by either low- or high-achieving youth can have substantively different effects on achievement has been largely ignored. In this paper, we show that while being embedded in a high-achieving network of friends is not associated with increased own achievement, being embedded in a low-achieving network is associated with decreased own achievement. In additional analyses, we present evidence that these associations are at least in part due to influence, as opposed to only selection effects or shared environment. We also examine whether the structure of the network in which a student is embedded might affect their educational achievement. We show that achieving at higher levels positively predicts how centrally located a student is in their network, but being more centrally located does not predict concurrent achievement. This finding suggests that the behavior of individuals is affecting the formation of network structure and not the reverse. (C) 2017 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

<title>Team talk: Learning, jargon, and structure versus the pulse of the network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.05.002</url>
<snippet>We began this work intending to illustrate the network origins of jargon, a signal feature of team learning and the division of labor. In the process, we came to recognize the substantive importance of message timing, which we discuss as the pulse of a network. This paper describes our route to that recognition. We analyze data from a renovated classic network experiment providing empirical support for three hypotheses. The first, and most familiar from past work, is that teams moving down their learning curve to greater efficiency are prone to shared jargon. As a team moves down its learning curve, language drifts away from day-to-day speech, into jargon. The second and third hypotheses concern network correlates of the drift. With respect to network structure, teams are less likely to converge on jargon when communication is concentrated in one teammate. With respect to pulse, teams are more likely to converge on jargon when communication efforts are numerous and crowded in time. The two network predictors overlap conceptually. They both involve learning and access to information, but are distinct in their mechanism: Structure provides access. Pulse creates motivation to access. Teammates keeping up with numerous messages concentrated in time have a shared incentive to find shorthand terms (i.e., jargon) that enable faster exchange of accurate information. Network structure predicts team convergence on jargon, but pulse is a stronger predictor. Directions for new research are discussed.

<title>Information Network Among Farmers: A Case Study in Ghana</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440241228696</url>
<snippet>It is well established that a person's productivity is strongly related to interactions among their network cycles. Despite this, much of the literature concerning farmers' productivity describes only their formal relationships with extension officials, ignoring their personal relationships. This study was motivated by the need to understand how farmers can use their social networks to promote information diffusion and learning among themselves. The study assessed whether farmers' information networks can positively influence their productivity and performance through the study of their network structure. We used survey data from 200 Ghanaian farmers. The data was then analyzed using descriptive statistics and an exponential random graph model (ERGM). The results of this study showed that farmers' information networks had a positive effect on their performance and productivity. The study also revealed that farmers seek information from key and influential farmers while key farmers also seek information from other key farmers. A further finding of the study showed that many factors contributed to the successful diffusion of information, such as popularity, activity spread, reciprocity, multiple connections, and homophily of experience. However, on the other hand, transitivity was not significant in this network. Hence, this study clarifies the effect of the structural characteristics of farmers' information network which influence information diffusion for higher performance and productivity. This study argues that agricultural managers should take measures to ensure that farmers understand how their information network can benefit their peers, as well as their own performance and productivity. Studies have shown that, personal interaction and networks has the ability to influence a person's productivity. But most of the existing literature concentrate much on the formal relationships with extension officials, ignoring personal relationships.

<title>Determinants of user acceptance of a specific social platform for older adults: An empirical examination of user interface characteristics and behavioral intention</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180102</url>
<snippet>The use of the Internet and social applications has many benefits for the elderly, but numerous investigations have shown that the elderly do not perceive online social networks as a friendly social environment. Therefore, TreeIt, a social application specifically designed for the elderly, was developed for this study. In the TreeIt application, seven mechanisms promoting social interaction were designed to allow older adults to use social networking sites (SNSs) to increase social connection, maintain the intensity of social connections and strengthen social experience. This study's main objective was to investigate how user interface design affects older people's intention and attitude related to using SNSs. Fourteen user interface evaluation heuristics proposed by Zhang et al. were adopted as the criteria to assess user interface usability and further grouped into three categories: system support, user interface design and navigation. The technology acceptance model was adopted to assess older people's intention and attitude related to using SNSs. One hundred and one elderly persons were enrolled in this study as subjects, and the results showed that all of the hypotheses proposed in this study were valid: system support and perceived usefulness had a significant effect on behavioral intention; user interface design and perceived ease of use were positively correlated with perceived usefulness; and navigation exerted an influence on perceived ease of use. The results of this study are valuable for the future development of social applications for the elderly.

<title>Hegemonic and Other Masculinities in Local Social Contexts</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X06298776</url>
<snippet>This article is a theoretical examination of Connell's social theory of gender, discussing how hegemonic, complicit, subordinate, and marginalized masculinities interact and relate to one another in the men's everyday lives in particular social contexts. Connell's theory is articulated in global terms that need to be localized to examine the actual interactions of men with one another. The theory implies a multilevel framework that the authors develop more explicitly. They investigate two interrelated theoretical concerns: (a) inadequately detailed interdependencies between structural, individual, and cultural factors with respect to masculinities, and (b) the lack of contextualization of masculinities in specific relational settings. The authors suggest that theoretical insights gained from social network theory and analysis allow such issues to be addressed and assist in local-level accounts of gendered power relations. The authors conclude by specifying Connell's theory into particular, testable hypotheses for use with statistical models for social networks.

<title>EXTRACTING REAL SOCIAL INTERACTIONS FROM A DEBATE OF COVID-19 POLICIES ON TWITTER: THE CASE OF MEXICO</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S021952592150017X</url>
<snippet>Twitter is a popular social medium for sharing opinions and engaging in topical debates, yet presents a wide spread of misinformation, especially in political debates, from bots and adversarial attacks. The current state-of-the-art methods for detecting humans and bots in Twitter often lack generalizability beyond English. Here, a language-agnostic method to detect real users and their interactions by leveraging network topology from retweets is presented. To that end, the chosen topic is COVID-19 policies in Mexico, which has been considered by users as polemic. Two kinds of network are built: a directed network of retweets; and the co-event network, where a non-directed link between two users exists if they have retweeted the same post in a given time window (projection of a bipartite network). Then, single node properties of these networks, such as the clustering coefficient and the degree, are studied. Three kinds of users are observed: some with a high clustering coefficient but a very small degree, a second group with zero clustering coefficient and a variable degree, and a third group in which the clustering coefficient as a function of the degree decays as a power law. This third group represents similar to 2&#37; of the users and is characteristic of dynamical networks with feedback. The latter seems to represent strongly interacting followers/followed in a real social network as confirmed by an inspection of such nodes. A percolation analysis of the resulting co-retweet and co-hashtag network reveals the relevance of such weak links, typical of real social human networks. The presented methods are simple to implement in other social media platforms and can be used to mitigate misinformation and conflicts.

<title>Going viral: How a single tweet spawned a COVID-19 conspiracy theory on Twitter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2053951720938405</url>
<snippet>In late March of 2020, a new hashtag, #FilmYourHospital, made its first appearance on social media. The hashtag encouraged people to visit local hospitals to take pictures and videos of empty hospitals to help "prove" that the COVID-19 pandemic is an elaborate hoax. Using techniques from Social Network Analysis, this case study examines how this conspiracy theory propagated on Twitter and whether the hashtag virality was aided by the use of automation or coordination among Twitter users. We found that while much of the content came from users with limited reach, the oxygen that fueled this conspiracy in its early days came from a handful of prominent conservative politicians and far right political activists on Twitter. These power users used this hashtag to build awareness about the campaign and to encourage their followers to break quarantine and film what is happening at their local hospitals. After the initial boost by a few prominent accounts, the campaign was mostly sustained by pro-Trump accounts, followed by a secondary wave of propagation outside the U.S. The rise of the #FilmYourHospital conspiracy from a single tweet demonstrates the ongoing challenge of addressing false, viral information during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the spread of misinformation can be potentially mitigated by fact-checking and directing people to credible sources of information from public health agencies, false and misleading claims that are driven by politics and supported by strong convictions and not science are much harder to root out.

<title>Is Bigger Always Better? Potential Biases of Big Data Derived from Social Network Sites</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002716215570866</url>
<snippet>This article discusses methodological challenges of using big data that rely on specific sites and services as their sampling frames, focusing on social network sites in particular. It draws on survey data to show that people do not select into the use of such sites randomly. Instead, use is biased in certain ways yielding samples that limit the generalizability of findings. Results show that age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, online experiences, and Internet skills all influence the social network sites people use and thus where traces of their behavior show up. This has implications for the types of conclusions one can draw from data derived from users of specific sites. The article ends by noting how big data studies can address the shortcomings that result from biased sampling frames.

<title>From news websites to social media: Unpacking the influence of online channels on presumed influence and responses to misinformation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102658</url>
<snippet>This study employs the theoretical model of the influence of presumed influence to examine the mechanisms that drive online users to engage in information authentication and social correction, which are critical for countering misinformation. In particular, this study examines how the perceived prevalence and presumed influence of misinformation affect the intention to verify and correct misinformation, and how the use of different online platforms (i.e., social networking sites, video platforms, instant messaging applications, and news websites) for political news shapes these perceptions. This research draws on survey data from 2,589 respondents in Taiwan. The findings indicate that perceived prevalence has a positive relationship with presumed influence, which in turn, leads to authentications and corrections. Moreover, using social networking sites and video platforms for political news is positively related to perceived prevalence, whereas instant messaging applications have a negative association.

<title>A Typology for Understanding the Connections Among Different Forms of Social Capital</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764209331524</url>
<snippet>Critics have argued that the term social capital is too vague or general to be a useful concept. Recognizing the need for clarification, the authors distill the conceptual discussions about social capital to argue that there are three components-network structure, trust and reciprocity, and resources-that are associated with but vary in degree and salience for all forms of social capital. These three components should be considered continua along which the forms of social capital can vary. A fourth continuum is between micro and macro levels of social capital. Locating particular examples of social capital along these continua opens the possibility to compare different types of social capital and to develop and test theories about how they are related to each other. The authors also describe a simulation study to illustrate how simulation can facilitate understanding of the linkages among different forms of social capital.

<title>Networked intimacy. Intimacy and friendship among Italian Facebook users</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1203970</url>
<snippet>In this paper, we describe the results of a qualitative study conducted with 120 Italian Facebook users to investigate how Facebook enables people to achieve a mutually constitutive intimacy with their own friendship network: a negotiation of intimacy in public through self-disclosure, where the affordances of the platform are useful to elicit significant reactions, validations and demonstrations of affection from others. We observed that, in order to achieve various levels of intimacy on Facebook, people engage in various strategies: Showing rather than telling, Sharing implicit content, Tagging, Expectation of mutual understanding and Liking. These strategies produce a collaborative disclosure that relies on others' cooperation to maintain the boundaries between private and public space. Based on these premises, we developed a framework of collaborative strategies for managing public intimacy that both systematizes and extends the findings identified in previous studies of intimacy on Facebook. We describe this framework as networked intimacy and we discuss the consequences of it in the light of already existing research on online self-disclosure.

<title>The Dynamics of Public Opinion in Complex Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>This paper studies the problem of public opinion formation and concentrates on the interplays among three factors: individual attributes, environmental influences and information flow. We present a simple model to analyze the dynamics of four types of networks. Our simulations suggest that regular communities establish not only local consensus, but also global diversity in public opinions. However, when small world networks, random networks, or scale-free networks model social relationships, the results are sensitive to the elasticity coefficient of environmental influences and the average connectivity of the type of network. For example, a community with a higher average connectivity has a higher probability of consensus. Yet, it is misleading to predict results merely based on the characteristic path length of networks. In the process of changing environmental influences and average connectivity, sensitive areas are discovered in the system. By sensitive areas we mean that interior randomness emerges and we cannot predict unequivocally how many opinions will remain upon reaching equilibrium. We also investigate the role of authoritative individuals in information control. While enhancing average connectivity facilitates the diffusion of the authoritative opinion, it makes individuals subject to disturbance from non-authorities as well. Thus, a moderate average connectivity may be preferable because then the public will most likely form an opinion that is parallel with the authoritative one. In a community with a scale-free structure, the influence of authoritative individuals keeps constant with the change of the average connectivity. Provided that the influence of individuals is proportional to the number of their acquaintances, the smallest percentage of authorities is required for a controlled consensus in a scale free network. This study shows that the dynamics of public opinion varies from community to community due to the different degree of impressionability of people and the distinct social network structure of the community.

<title>Echo chamber effects on short video platforms</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33370-1</url>
<snippet>In recent years, short videos have become an increasingly vital source of information. To compete for users' attention, short video platforms have been overusing algorithmic technology, making the group polarization intensify, which is likely to push users into the homogeneous "echo chamber". However, echo chambers can contribute to the spread of misleading information, false news, or rumors, which have negative social impacts. Therefore, it is necessary to explore echo chamber effects in short video platforms. Moreover, the communication paradigms between users and feed algorithms greatly vary across short video platforms. This paper investigated echo chamber effects of three popular short video platforms (Douyin, TikTok, and Bilibili) using social network analysis and explored how user features influenced the generation of echo chambers. We quantified echo chamber effects through two primary ingredients: selective exposure and homophily, in both platform and topic dimensions. Our analyses indicate that the gathering of users into homogeneous groups dominates online interactions on Douyin and Bilibili. We performed performance comparison of echo chamber effects and found that echo chamber members tend to display themselves to attract the attention of their peers and that cultural differences can prevent the development of echo chambers. Our findings are of great value in designing targeted management strategies to prevent the spread of misleading information, false news, or rumors.

<snippet>In this article, we explore how talk about Nazis is used in Internet discussions regarding asylum seeking, and the issue of whether or not opposition to asylum seeking is racist. Discursive analysis was conducted on discussions about asylum seeking from the social networking website Facebook, where references to Nazis were made. Three strategies were identified: (1) people supporting asylum seeking accuse asylum opponents of being racist by referring to Nazis; (2) opponents of asylum seeking deal with such accusations by arguing that the debate is being suppressed because of references to Nazis; (3) in the final, and most striking, strategy, opponents of asylum draw upon ideas associated with the Nazis and Hitler to bring about their anti-asylum position. These findings are discussed in relation to how the link between Nazis and racism is emerging in the asylum debate.

<title>Structure and Agency in Networked, Distributed Work: The Role of Work Engagement</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764214556807</url>
<snippet>In this article, we examine the social structure of workplace relationships (both actual and desired ties) in networked distributed work. We focus on the role of human agency in forming networks needed to succeed in this environment. In particular, we address how employee work engagement enables individuals to occupy the network positions that they need in order to succeed in networked and virtual settings. We analyze a distributed team within a large multinational firm involved in software development and delivery activities and find that highly engaged employees have personal networks that are anchored locally (i.e., strong ties with colleagues who are collocated and more transitive triples) and connect globally (i.e., strong ties with distant colleagues and more liaison brokerage ties across geographic locations). We also find a general tendency for all respondents to desire new ties that reach across global locations to improve performance at work. However, only the highly engaged employees achieve these ties highlighting the role of motivation and agency associated with engagement.

<title>Age, gender, personality, ideological attitudes and individual differences in a person's news spectrum: how many and who might be prone to "filter bubbles" and "echo chambers" online?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03214</url>
<snippet>Potential effects of demographics, personality, and ideological attitudes on the number of news sources consumed should be investigated. The number of news sources consumed, in turn, was seen as inverse proxy for the susceptibility to be caught in "filter bubbles" and/or "echo chambers" (online), which are hotly discussed topics also in politics. A sample of 1,681 (n = 557 males) participants provided data on demographics, the Big Five as well as Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) alongside the number of different news sources consumed and current voting preferences. Results showed that age (positively), gender (higher in males), Openness (positively), and RWA (negatively) predicted the number of different news sources consumed. The group of participants consuming news exclusively offline showed highest scores in Conscientiousness and lowest scores in Neuroticism compared to the "news feeds only" and the "news feeds and online" groups. However, less than 5&#37; of the participants exclusively consumed news via news feeds of social networking sites. Participants who stated that they would not vote reported the lowest number of different news sources consumed. These findings reveal first insights into predisposing factors for the susceptibility to be caught in "filter bubbles" and/or "echo chamber" online and how this might be associated with voting preferences.

<title>The Complex Impact of Relational Embeddedness on Enterprise Value: The Moderating Effect of Environmental Dynamics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/6526934</url>
<snippet>Based on social network theory and dynamic capability theory, a theoretical model is constructed that specifies the process through which relational embeddedness affects enterprise value. The authors selected 612 Shenzhen and Shanghai A-share manufacturing enterprises in the CSMAR database as sample enterprises, and a multiple regression analysis method was used to test hypotheses. The results show that (1) there is an inverted "U" relationship between relational embeddedness and enterprise value; that is, the enterprises' relational embeddedness has an "inflection point" effect on the enterprise value; (2) the enterprises' resource integration capability plays an intermediate role in the impact of relational embeddedness on enterprise value; (3) the market environmental dynamics and technology environmental dynamics play negative regulatory roles in the inverted "U" relationship between relational embeddedness and enterprise value, and they play different regulatory roles before and after the enterprise relational embeddedness reaches the "inflection point"; that is, before the relational embeddedness reaches the inflection point, the technology environmental dynamics plays a major negative regulatory role, while after the relational embeddedness reaches the inflection point, the market environmental dynamics plays a major negative regulatory role. Compared with the market environmental dynamics, the impact of technology environmental dynamics on the relationship between relational embeddedness and enterprise value is more significant; that is, the effect of relational embeddedness on enterprises value is more sensitive to the technology environmental dynamics.

<title>The revenue model of mainstream online social networks and potential alternatives: A scenario-based evaluation by German adolescents and adults</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102569</url>
<snippet>Mainstream Online Social Networks (OSNs) face extensive criticism for their revenue model and its negative consequences for users and societies. While experts often discuss alternative OSN models, little is known about potential users' evaluations of different OSN models. To close this research gap, the present study investigates how non-expert individuals, i.e., potential users, evaluate mainstream OSNs and expert-proposed alternative models. Next to the general evaluations of different models, individual differences among users open to various OSN models were explored. Three OSN scenarios were created based on interviews with experts from academia and industry and presented to samples of German adolescents (N = 1166) and adults (N = 878): one describing the "status quo", one "option" model similar to the model currently considered by Meta, and one describing a "public-service" broadcasting OSN. Participants rated each characteristic of the "status quo" scenario, indicated their willingness to pay for each of the three OSN models, and specified their preferred OSN model next to providing sociodemographic information. Replicated across both samples was that the "status quo" scenario received predominantly negative evaluations. Further replicated across both samples was that most participants were willing to pay for a "public-service" OSN and chose this model as the preferred one. Only a few significant relations of sociodemographic variables were observed. Consistently replicated across both samples, men rated various characteristics of the "status quo" scenario more positively, and women were more likely to prefer the "public-service" OSN. Some differences between the two samples also emerged. In summary, both adolescents and adults demonstrated receptivity to alternative OSN models, especially a public-service broadcasting OSN. Most sociodemographic factors had limited influence indicating potential widespread adoption if such an alternative was implemented - at least in Germany. Consequences arising from such a model for platform design, policy, regulation, and governance are discussed.

<title>THE USE OF ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKING BY RURAL YOUTH AND ITS EFFECTS ON COMMUNITY ATTACHMENT</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2010.539243</url>
<snippet>In recent years, an increasing amount of attention has been placed on improving access to Information and Communication Technology in the United States. With the rapidity at which broadband construction projects are dotting America, it is important to understand the social impacts of these infrastructural projects. One particularly salient issue is whether access to the Internet would decrease the involvement of youth in their home communities since youth and issues of talent retention are crucial to the long-term viability of rural communities. However, findings on this topic have been a mixed bag with some studies suggesting that the use of online social networking decreases community involvement while others have found that it may maintain or even increase community involvement. This study set out to clarify the conflicting findings and in the process, it has found support for both the displacement effect as well as an augmentation effect. The dual processes suggest that merely examining time spent on social networking sites does not provide a complete picture of the effects of Internet use on community involvement. The nature of the interactions and the participants in the online social networking also play an important role. For rural community leaders working towards the long-term viability of their communities, the findings suggest that efforts should be directed towards mitigating the displacement effects of Internet use while harnessing popular Internet applications such as social networking sites to augment the involvement that youth have in their home communities.

<title>Breaking the Structural Reinforcement: An Agent-Based Model on Cultural Consumption and Social Relations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393211056501</url>
<snippet>Theorists since Marx, Bourdieu, and DiMaggio have asked how individual choices on cultural preference interact with collective social network structure. The rise of social media in today's communication landscape motivates us to take a closer look at the involved dynamics. We designed an agent-based model to explore how different behavioral principles for cultural choice and communicative affiliation affect (1) collective consumption patterns, (2) social segregation, and (3) resilience of the emergent dynamic during exogenous distributions. We analyze the influence of individual agency on network structure, and vice versa, by simulating agents who pursue elite or popular culture, while communicating with others based on homophily or randomness. Our method allows us to go beyond specific constellations and explore the realm of theoretically possible combinations. We then used an exogenous disturbance on elite culture cost to test the resilience of social network structure. We found that only in societies where economic factors drive cultural consumption, increased access to elite culture can lead to reorganization in the social network and reduce segregation between different social groups. This is because the disturbance on consumption provides agents opportunities to connect with other social groups and opens a window for social mixing. We end by discussing how our model allows us to inform a diverse set of empirical research questions, including the cultural markets of social media, the digital divide, and the split between free misinformation and established news outlets.

<title>Women's participation in the labor force: the role of social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-8733(99)00003-9</url>
<snippet>Network research about employment outcomes has rarely focused on women. In this paper, we use the Los Angeles Survey of Urban Inequality (LASUI) to examine the role of social networks on the constraints and opportunities which women face in labor force participation. We examine the effects of a woman's general network structure on her employment status, rather than focusing on the characteristics of the specific network tie that connected her to a job. Using an innovative, yet simple, measure to capture network diversity, we test network explanations of why women are in the paid labor force, controlling for background, structural, and family composition variables. In general, we find that the greater the quality and diversity of the social resources that are available through a woman's social network, the more likely she is to be working for pay. We also find evidence that suggests disadvantaged women with children must also rely on their social support networks for childcare to enter the labor market. In addition, we explore the connection between the methods successful job searchers used to find work and the overall structure of their networks through descriptive statistics.

<title>Investigating Italian disinformation spreading on Twitter in the context of 2019 European elections</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227821</url>
<snippet>We investigate the presence (and the influence) of disinformation spreading on online social networks in Italy, in the 5-month period preceding the 2019 European Parliament elections. To this aim we collected a large-scale dataset of tweets associated to thousands of news articles published on Italian disinformation websites. In the observation period, a few outlets accounted for most of the deceptive information circulating on Twitter, which focused on controversial and polarizing topics of debate such as immigration, national safety and (Italian) nationalism. We found evidence of connections between Italian disinformation sources and different disinformation outlets across Europe, U.S. and Russia, featuring similar, even translated, articles in the period before the elections. Overall, the spread of disinformation on Twitter was confined in a limited community, strongly (and explicitly) related to the Italian conservative and far-right political environment, who had a limited impact on online discussions on the up-coming elections.

<title>Adopting, Networking, and Communicating on Twitter: A Cross-National Comparative Analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439316672826</url>
<snippet>Twitter is one of the most popular online social network platforms for political communication. This study explains how political candidates in five countries increase their online popularity and visibility by their behavior on Twitter. Also, the study focuses on cultural differences in online social relations by comparing political candidates in five countries in the East and West: South Korea, Japan, United Kingdom, Canada, and the Netherlands. Findings show that signing up to Twitter as early as possible increases one's online popularity as predicted by the process of preferential attachment. Candidates actively following citizens and sending undirected tweets also increases the group of followers. This doesn't apply however to conversational tweets, which decreases the number of a candidate's followers slightly. South Korea, having a collectivistic culture, shows higher levels of reciprocity on Twitter, although this does not increase the group of followers. In other countries, including collectivistic Japan, candidates reciprocate less frequently with citizens, effectively using Twitter more as a mass medium for broadcasting.

<title>Peers and Sources as Social Capital in the Production of News: Online Social Networks as Communities of Journalists</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439314539128</url>
<snippet>In a very short time span, Twitter has become a major force in modern societies and also in the production of news by journalists. How journalists use Twitter is studied extensively, particularly on a small scale (i.e., qualitative research, specific events, mostly descriptive). However, studies on how Twitter has impacted journalism as a whole are relatively scarce. This study focuses on the adoption of Twitter and its emerging community network structure in the Netherlands. Using the social network data of 2,152 journalists as retrieved from Twitter, analysis shows that the social network among journalists is well connected. The journalists who are extremely popular are also able to influence the flow of information through the network more than others (cf. gatekeeper role). Still, even though gatekeeping positions in the network are present due to the absence of specific relations, and the network consists of eight tightly knit network communities, the entire network is very well connected. The adoption of Twitter as a microblogging and networking service over time indicated that adoption increased particularly in early 2009. The possible consequences of these tightly knit communities for the production of news are discussed in terms of pack journalism, echo chambers, and information cascades.

<title>The Early-Life Origins of Later-Life Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spaa047</url>
<snippet>Personal social networks profoundly influence a wide range of outcomes throughout the life course. But little research has considered how some features of individuals' social networks may be shaped by experiences in early life. This study uses nationally representative data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project to examine how childhood circumstances may shape the structure of older adults' personal social networks. The analyses show that higher childhood socioeconomic status is associated with larger network size and a more expansive, less kin-based network structure. At the same time, higher levels of family happiness in childhood are associated with greater network density and more kin-centric network composition, which may reflect greater access to social support and overall network intimacy across the life course. The results suggest that studies of the relative advantages of social network structure may benefit from contextualizing individuals' social networks in terms of their social origins. The article discusses the need for additional research on the life-course bases of the link between childhood circumstances and later-life network properties, and what role this connection plays in shaping later-life well-being.

<title>Are Immigrants Really Lacking Social Networking Skills? The Crucial Role of Reciprocity in Building Ethnically Diverse Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0038038515596896</url>
<snippet>Increasing ethnic and social diversity in cities does not translate into diverse networks of urbanites. Particularly for white middle-classes in gentrified neighbourhoods, there is evidence on boundary drawing to ` unwanted groups' such as ethnic minorities and lower-classes. Rarely have these studies focused on the networks of ethnic minorities, the actual diversity-bringers. I will contribute to the understanding of why and under what circumstances diversity in neighbourhoods gets translated into people's daily practices, hence also networks, by analysing those of middle-class TurkishGermans in Berlin. Based on interviews and network analysis, I will show that a neighbourhood's ethnic diversity, fellow residents' attitudes towards diversity and the built environment play an important role in building category-crossing ties. Owing to a lack of reciprocity in establishing ties, Turkish-Germans in neighbourhoods with a high share of native-Germans actually have more ties to Turks than those in a more diverse neighbourhood.

<title>Digital networks: Elements of a theoretical framework</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.12.002</url>
<snippet>The proliferation of new, digital communications technologies and platforms over the past few decades has transformed the way humans relate to one another. In turn, there has been an explosion of scientific research using data on these interactions to better understand how social networks emerge and evolve. Curiously, this agenda has proceeded with little theoretical foundation-typically assuming digital and face-to-face ties operate the same way. The purpose of this article is to interrogate this assumption: I identify when, how, and to what consequence digital networks are similar to and different from other kinds of social networks and thereby attempt to strengthen the available theoretical scaffolding for this important and rapidly growing body of work.

<title>Persistence and change in structural signatures of tie formation over time</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.12.001</url>
<snippet>Using data on the formation of Facebook friendships from over 100,000 students at the 1141 four-year colleges and universities in the Department of Education Scorecard dataset, we examine whether students' tendencies to form more open or closed relations (their closure "signature") persist as they leave high school and attend college, and whether this varies by the type of institution attended. Despite significant persistence of individual signature, for the case of Facebook friendships, individuals do tend to adopt the closure signature that characterizes their school. Contrary to expectation, students at more selective colleges are more, not less, likely to form friends with those with whom they share more friends. Yet, at the crucial time of transition to a new school, they form more open ties, due to the tendency of very popular students to reach out to those they generally would not form ties with.

<title>Social dynamics of core members in mixed-species bird flocks change across a gradient of foraging habitat quality</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262385</url>
<snippet>Social associations within mixed-species bird flocks can promote information flow about food availability and provide predator avoidance benefits. The relationship between flocking propensity, foraging habitat quality, and interspecific competition can be altered by human-induced habitat degradation. Here we take a close look at sociality within two ecologically important flock-leader (core) species, the Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis) and tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), to better understand how degradation of foraging habitat quality affects mixed-species flocking dynamics. We compared interactions of free ranging wild birds across a gradient of foraging habitat quality in three managed forest remnants. Specifically, we examined aspects of the social network at each site, including network density, modularity, and species assortativity. Differences in the social networks between each end of our habitat gradient suggest that elevated levels of interspecific association are more valuable in the habitat with low quality foraging conditions. This conclusion is supported by two additional findings: First, foraging height for the subordinate Carolina chickadee relative to the tufted titmouse decreased with an increase in the number of satellite species in the most disturbed site but not in the other two sites. Second, the chickadee gargle call rate, an acoustic signal emitted during agonistic encounters between conspecifics, was relatively higher at the high-quality site. Collectively, these results suggest an increase in heterospecific associations increases the value of cross-species information flow in degraded habitats.

<title>Network formation in organizational settings: Exploring the importance of local social processes and team-level contextual variables in small groups using bayesian hierarchical ERGMs</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.07.001</url>
<snippet>Statistical models for social networks, such as exponential random graphs (ERGMs), have increasingly been used by organizational scholars to study the social interactions inside organizations, departments, and teams. While such models have been successful in providing insights about the local processes that underlie these interactions (such as homophily, reciprocity or transitivity), an additional interesting avenue for research focuses on the role of group -level contextual variables (such as the climate or composition of a team or organization) when considering a multitude of teams or organizations. In this paper we show how, in a team context, integrating team -level factors in a multilevel framework (i.e., a Bayesian hierarchical ERGM) enables us to answer questions about: 1) how team -level contextual factors might provide alternative explanations for the emergence of intra-team ties, and 2) whether any variation in local tendencies between teams might be dependent on such team -level variables (i.e., cross -level interactions). Using data collected among 103 MBA students who were grouped into 18 teams of 5-7 members to work on a project, we study the impact of members' expertise and perceived psychological safety on advice seeking behavior. At a local level, we focus on the effect of these nodal attributes for homophily and differences in advice seeking and giving, while at the team level we incorporate the average expertise and the team's psychological safety climate. Our results show that expert members are more likely to be the recipient of advice ties, but also that this effect is more pronounced in teams where the overall level of expertise is high. For psychological safety, we find that a high psychological safety climate impacts the advice relations among all members in the group, not solely those who themselves perceive a high level of psychological safety, suggesting that the team climate has an impact on all its members. This illustrates how a Bayesian hierarchical ERGM allows us to obtain relevant results even when studying small -sized groups.

<title>A scoping review on the current and potential use of social network analysis for evaluation purposes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1356389018782219</url>
<snippet>The pervasiveness and importance of relationships and networks has fueled the development of the social network analysis approach, which considers structural relationships to be primary causes of societal outcomes. While the potential of social network analysis has been demonstrated and discussed extensively in social science research, relatively little is known about the current and potential use of social network analysis for evaluation purposes. This scoping review of journal articles reveals that evaluators use social network analysis because of its ability to identify key stakeholders, assess network structures and relationships quantitatively, reveal informal relations and visualize even complex networks. However, challenges arise when interpreting findings, determining causation between network structures and outcomes and disseminating evaluation results in an ethically responsible manner. The review concludes that the evaluation field?especially in the development sector?would benefit greatly from increased use of social network analysis, but that this would first require improved use of alternative sources of network data, qualitative methods and inferential statistics that will enable evaluators to move beyond descriptive network analysis.

<title>Reconstruction of the socio-semantic dynamics of political activist Twitter networks-Method and application to the 2017 French presidential election</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0201879</url>
<snippet>Background Digital spaces, and in particular social networking sites, are becoming increasingly present and influential in the functioning of our democracies. In this paper, we propose an integrated methodology for the data collection, the reconstruction, the analysis and the visualization of the development of a country's political landscape from Twitter data. Method The proposed method relies solely on the interactions between Twitter accounts and is independent of the characteristics of the shared contents such as the language of the tweets. We validate our methodology on a case study on the 2017 French presidential election (60 million Twitter exchanges between more than 2.4 million users) via two independent methods: the comparison between our automated political categorization and a human categorization based on the evaluation of a sample of 5000 profiles descriptions; the correspondence between the reconfigurations detected in the reconstructed political landscape and key political events reported in the media. This latter validation demonstrated the ability of our approach to accurately reflect the reconfigurations at play in the off-line political scene. Results We built on this reconstruction to give insights into the opinion dynamics and the reconfigurations of political communities at play during a presidential election. First, we propose a quantitative description and analysis of the political engagement of members of political communities. Second, we analyze the impact of political communities on information diffusion and in particular on their role in the fake news phenomena. We measure a differential echo chamber effect on the different types of political news (fake news, debunks, standard news) caused by the community structure and emphasize the importance of addressing the meso-structures of political networks in understanding the fake news phenomena. Conclusions Giving access to an intermediate level, between sociological surveys in the field and large statistical studies (such as those conducted by national or international organizations) we demonstrate that social networks data make it possible to qualify and quantify the activity of political communities in a multi-polar political environment; as well as their temporal evolution and reconfiguration, their structure, their alliance strategies and their semantic particularities during a presidential campaign through the analysis of their digital traces. We conclude this paper with a comment on the political and ethical implications of the use of social networks data in politics. We stress the importance of developing social macroscopes that will enable citizens to better understand how they collectively make society and propose as example the "Politoscope", a macroscope that delivers some of our results in an interactive way.

<title>Substance Use Homophily Among Geosocial Networking Application Using Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex With Men</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-015-0581-6</url>
<snippet>Geosocial networking applications (GSN apps) represent important virtual contexts in which gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) seek affiliation. These apps allow users to create and view public profiles, send photos, and text messages, and connect with other users based on shared interests and geographic proximity. The present study examined substance use homophily among a sample of 295 MSM recruited via a popular GSN app. Comparisons of social network members met via GSN app versus elsewhere and associations between both individual and network characteristics and recent binge drinking, marijuana use, and illicit substance use were explored using bivariate tests of association and multivariate logistic regression analyses. High rates of recent binge drinking (59 &#37;), marijuana use (37 &#37;), and illicit substance use (27 &#37;) were observed among participants. GSN app use greater than 1 year and showing naked chest or abs in a profile picture were positively associated with recent illicit substance use. In multivariate analyses, the strongest predictors of binge drinking (AOR 3.81; 95 &#37; CI 1.86-7.80), marijuana use (AOR 4.12; 95 &#37; CI 2.22-7.64), and illicit substance use (AOR 6.45; 95 &#37; CI 3.26-12.79) were the presence of a social network member who also engaged in these behaviors. Social network interventions that target binge drinking, marijuana use, and illicit substance use may be delivered via GSN apps to reduce the prevalence of substance use and related risks among MSM in these virtual contexts.

<title>Partnership Ties Shape Friendship Networks: A Dynamic Social Network Study</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/sov079</url>
<snippet>Partnership ties shape friendship networks through different social forces. First, partnership ties drive clustering in friendship networks: individuals who are in a partnership tend to have common friends and befriend other couples. Second, partnership ties influence the level of homophily in these emerging friendship clusters. Partners tend to be similar in a number of attributes (homogamy). If one partner selects friends based on preferences for homophily, then the other partner may befriend the same person regardless of whether they also have homophilic preferences. Thus, two homophilic ties emerge based on a single partner's preferences. This amplification of homophily can be observed in many attributes (e.g., ethnicity, religion, age). Gender homophily, however, may be de-amplified, as the gender of partners differs in heterosexual partnerships. In our study, we follow dynamic friendship formation among 126 individuals and their cohabiting partners in a university-related graduate housing community over a period of nine months (N = 2,250 self-reported friendship relations). We find that partnership ties strongly shape the dynamic process of friendship formation. They are a main driver of local network clustering and explain a striking amount of homophily.

<title>Detecting and modelling real percolation and phase transitions of information on social media</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01090-z</url>
<snippet>Xie et al. directly observe the percolation phase transition of information on large-scale online social media and find that the positive-feedback coevolution between users' activity level and network structure greatly increases the spreading power. It is widely believed that information spread on social media is a percolation process, with parallels to phase transitions in theoretical physics. However, evidence for this hypothesis is limited, as phase transitions have not been directly observed in any social media. Here, through an analysis of 100 million Weibo and 40 million Twitter users, we identify percolation-like spread and find that it happens more readily than current theoretical models would predict. The lower percolation threshold can be explained by the existence of positive feedback in the coevolution between network structure and user activity level, such that more-active users gain more followers. Moreover, this coevolution induces an extreme imbalance in users' influence. Our findings indicate that the ability of information to spread across social networks is higher than expected, with implications for many information-spread problems.

<title>Consume, Modify, Share (CMS): The Interplay between Individual Decisions and Structural Network Properties in the Diffusion of Information</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164651</url>
<snippet>Widely used information diffusion models such as Independent Cascade Model, Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) and others fail to acknowledge that information is constantly subject to modification. Some aspects of information diffusion are best explained by network structural characteristics while in some cases strong influence comes from individual decisions. We introduce reinvention, the ability to modify information, as an individual level decision that affects the diffusion process as a whole. Based on a combination of constructs from the Diffusion of Innovations and the Critical Mass Theories, the present study advances the CMS (consume, modify, share) model which accounts for the interplay between network structure and human behavior and interactions. The model's building blocks include processes leading up to and following the formation of a critical mass of information adopters and disseminators. We examine the formation of an inflection point, information reach, sustainability of the diffusion process and collective value creation. The CMS model is tested on two directed networks and one undirected network, assuming weak or strong ties and applying constant and relative modification schemes. While all three networks are designed for disseminating new knowledge they differ in structural properties. Our findings suggest that modification enhances the diffusion of information in networks that support undirected connections and carries the biggest effect when information is shared via weak ties. Rogers' diffusion model and traditional information contagion models are fine tuned. Our results show that modifications not only contribute to a sustainable diffusion process, but also aid information in reaching remote areas of the network. The results point to the importance of cultivating weak ties, allowing reciprocal interaction among nodes and supporting the modification of information in promoting diffusion processes. These results have theoretical and practical implications for designing networks aimed at accelerating the creation and diffusion of information.

<title>Multidisciplinary learning through collective performance favors decentralization</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2303568120</url>
<snippet>Many models of learning in teams assume that team members can share solutions or learn concurrently. However, these assumptions break down in multidisciplinary teams where team members often complete distinct, interrelated pieces of larger tasks. Such contexts make it difficult for individuals to separate the performance effects of their own actions from the actions of interacting neighbors. In this work, we show that individuals can overcome this challenge by learning from network neighbors through mediating artifacts (like collective performance assessments). When neighbors' actions influence collective outcomes, teams with different networks perform relatively similarly to one another. However, varying a team's network can affect performance on tasks that weight individuals' contributions by network properties. Consequently, when individuals innovate (through "exploring" searches), dense networks hurt performance slightly by increasing uncertainty. In contrast, dense networks moderately help performance when individuals refine their work (through "exploiting" searches) by efficiently finding local optima. We also find that decentralization improves team performance across a battery of 34 tasks. Our results offer design principles for multidisciplinary teams within which other forms of learning prove more difficult.

<title>TUNES THAT BIND? Predicting friendship strength in a music-based social network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13691180802635430</url>
<snippet>Despite the popularity of social network sites based on common interests, the association between these shared interests and relational development is not well understood. This manuscript reports results of an empirical investigation of interpersonal relationships on Last. fm, amusic-based social network site with a multinational user base. In addition to baseline descriptors of relational behavior, the chief goals of this study were to examine the degree to which Last. fm relationships are characterized by homophily (and particularly by shared musical taste), the extent to which communication via Last. fm is associated with other forms of communication (both offline and online), how such communication behavior is associated with demographic and relational characteristics, and whether these variables predict strength of relational development. Results indicate that although Last. fm relational partners exhibit shared musical taste, this shared taste is not associated with relational development. Rather, following media multiplexity theory, relational development is strongly and uniquely associated with communication behavior across almost all forms of communication (including Last. fm). These results suggest that shared interests may foster the creation of weak ties, but conversion of these connections to strong ties is relatively rare.

<title>The role of network setting and gender in online content popularity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1252411</url>
<snippet>In this study, we explore the role of specific network structures that enhance social capital and assess the extent to which gender, social ties, and communication interaction relate to content popularity within online social networks (OSNs). Our results are based on an extensive OSN data set, containing over 100,000 members, connected by over 1.7 million links. The findings indicate that content popularity inference is more accurate when considering activity interaction among users and that network structures known as advantageous for amassing social capital in the offline environment are relevant online as well. We conclude by discussing how gender mediates the correlation between some network measures and the growth of users' content popularity and provide a potential explanation for the emergence of gender differences.

<title>Studying information recurrence, gatekeeping, and the role of communities during internet outages in Venezuela</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87473-8</url>
<snippet>Many authoritarian regimes have taken to censoring internet access in order to stop the spread of misinformation, restrict citizens from discussing certain topics, and prevent mobilization, among other reasons. There are several theories about the effectiveness of censorship. Some suggest that censorship will effectively limit the flow of information, whereas others predict that a backlash will form, resulting in ultimately more discussion about the topic. In this work, we analyze the role of communities and gatekeepers during multiple internet outages in Venezuela in January 2019. First, we measure how critical information (e.g., entities and hashtags) spreads during outages focusing on information recurrence and burstiness within and across language and location communities. We discover that information bursts tend to cross both language and location community boundaries rather than being limited to a single community during several outages. Then we identify users who play central roles and propose a novel method to detect gatekeepers-users who prevent critical information from spreading across communities during outages. We show that bilingual and English-speaking users play more central roles compared to Spanish-speaking users, but users inside and outside Venezuela have similar distribution of centrality. Finally, we measure the differences in social network structure before and after each outage event and discuss its effect on how information spreads. We find that with each outage event social connections tend to get less connected with higher mean shortest path, indicating that the effect of censorship makes it harder for information to spread.

<title>A GENEALOGY OF BADGES Inherited meaning and monstrous moral hybrids</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2011.641992</url>
<snippet>The use of badges on the web, particularly on community sites, has become very popular, and these badges are becoming both more easily carried from one site to another and more valuable in the process. But badges are not new; the metaphor of the online badge draws on centuries of use in the offline world. And the use of badges online has the potential of bringing with it the echo of these earlier uses and the values that they were imbued with. This article explores online badges, drawing on their history and the ethical framework presented by Jane Jacobs in 'Systems of Survival' to suggest some ways of ensuring that badges are used effectively online.

<title>Life course similarities on social networking sites</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2016.04.002</url>
<snippet>Dyadic social relations are known to exhibit homophily - attraction and bonding between similar individuals - and recent studies have detected homophily also on the social network level. Here, we investigate whether social media networks exhibit signs of homophily with regards to life stages. Using a large and global database (N = 111,863) of social media profile pictures, we investigate proportions of picture types in an individual's social network. Typical stages of young adulthood include peer group formation, mate searching, union formation, and parenting. We studied to what extent different association categories with pictures of one or several individuals correlated with each other. Results showed that users with a profile picture of a single individual were more likely to have other profile pictures of single individuals of the opposite sex, but not of the same sex, in their social media network. Profile pictures of heterosexual couples were more likely to appear with other heterosexual couple pictures, and profiles with baby pictures were strongly associated with the frequency of other baby pictures within the same network; both of these types were negatively associated with the frequency of pictures of singles. Pictures of two females together were positively linked with the largest number of other association types. The results probably reflect both selection and contagion effects. We conclude that contemporary social media networks appear to exhibit homophily in displays related to mate searching, pair bonds, and the transition to parenthood. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

<snippet>Several hypotheses are derived that relate social networks to the occupational prestige attainment process. These hypotheses are evaluated using theoretically derived indicators and ordinary least squares regression. Most of the hypotheses considered in this paper do not receive support, and the one hypothesis that does lacks a consistent theoretical explanation. From this analysis, I draw two important conclusions: First, the relationship between the prestige of a social network contact and prestige attainment may be empirically strong, bur the theoretical explanation linking them lacks consistency. Secondly, empirical work performed to test social network theories should no longer focus on dyadic data alone. The broader implications of these conclusions for future research are considered.

<title>The Digital Activism Gap: How Class and Costs Shape Online Collective Action</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spx042</url>
<snippet>What is the relationship between social class and online participation in social movements? Scholars suggest that low costs to digital activism broaden participation and challenge conventional collective action theories, but given the digital divide, little is known about cost variation across social movement organizations from different social classes. A focus on high levels of digital engagement and extraordinary events leaves scant information about the effect of social class on digital mobilization patterns and everyday practices within and across organizations. This study takes a field-level approach to incorporate all groups involved in one statewide political issue, thereby including organizations with different social class compositions, from Tea Parties to labor unions. Data collection spans online and off-line digital activism practices. With an index to measure digital engagement from an original data set of over 90,000 online posts, findings show deep digital activism inequalities between working-class and middle/upper-class groups. In-depth interviews and ethnographic observations reveal that the mechanisms of this digital activism gap are organizational resources, along with individual disparities in access, skills, empowerment and time. These factors create high costs of online participation for working-class groups. Rather than reduced costs equalizing online participation, substantial costs contribute to digital activism inequality.

<title>Advertising to a social network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11129-010-9093-9</url>
<snippet>Direct advertising-sending promotional messages to individual customers-is increasingly used by marketers as a result of the recent improvements in consumer reachability. Most current methods to calculate optimal budgets for such advertising campaigns consider customers in isolation and ignore word-of-mouth communication (WOM). When the customer base forms a network (as is the case in telecom or social network databases) ignoring WOM clearly leads to suboptimal advertising budgets. This paper develops a model to help address this challenge. We assume that firms know the network structure formed by customers but do not know (or are not allowed to use) data on individuals' connections. Under this scenario, we compare the optimal campaign of a monopolist to that of firms competing in simultaneous-move or sequential-move games. The analysis provides two key insights: (i) we show that ignoring the existence of WOM leads to significant profit loss for firms and this is more so under competition. In particular, knowing the "density" of consumer connections is crucial for the design of optimal campaigns. (ii) Competition in direct advertising exhibits strong first-mover advantages and, even in a simultaneous-move game between identical firms, highly asymmetric outcomes are possible. The paper also explores two extensions. First, we study the nature of the trade-off between increasing network size versus increasing the connectivity between existing network members. Second, we investigate how firms' advertising activity may endogenously grow the membership base.

<title>Microblog credibility indicators regarding misinformation of genetically modified food on Weibo</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252392</url>
<snippet>The considerable amount of misinformation on social media regarding genetically modified (GM) food will not only hinder public understanding but also mislead the public to make unreasoned decisions. This study discovered a new mechanism of misinformation diffusion in the case of GM food and applied a framework of supervised machine learning to identify effective credibility indicators for the misinformation prediction of GM food. Main indicators are proposed, including user identities involved in spreading information, linguistic styles, and propagation dynamics. Results show that linguistic styles, including sentiment and topics, have the dominant predictive power. In addition, among the user identities, engagement, and extroversion are effective predictors, while reputation has almost no predictive power in this study. Finally, we provide strategies that readers should be aware of when assessing the credibility of online posts and suggest improvements that Weibo can use to avoid rumormongering and enhance the science communication of GM food.

<title>VOTE BUYING IN INDONESIA: CANDIDATE STRATEGIES, MARKET LOGIC AND EFFECTIVENESS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jea.2016.31</url>
<snippet>What underlying logic explains candidate participation in vote buying, given that clientelist exchange is so difficult to enforce? We address this question through close analysis of campaigns by several dozen candidates in two electoral districts in Java, Indonesia. Analyzing candidates' targeting and pricing strategies, we show that candidates used personal brokerage structures that drew on social networks to identify voters and deliver payments to them. But these candidates achieved vote totals averaging about one quarter of the number of payments they distributed. Many candidates claimed to be targeting loyalists, suggestive of "turnout buying," but judged loyalty in personal rather than partisan terms, and extended their vote-buying reach through personal connections mediated by brokers. Candidates were market sensitive, paying prices per vote determined not only by personal resources, but also by constituency size and prices offered by competitors. Accordingly, we argue that a market logic structures Indonesia's system of vote buying.

<title>Social Support and the Religious Dimensions of Close Ties</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12134</url>
<snippet>Despite the influence of social support on physical and mental health, few studies have examined why some close ties are more supportive than others. Though religion provides a rich context for social interaction and a meaningful social identity, it has received little attention in the social support literature. A growing literature on religion and health offers insight into how religion affects social support processes. Using dyadic network data derived from the nationally representative 2006 Portraits of American Life Study, I examine how the religious dimensions of close, nonhousehold ties relate to provision of social support. Results from logistic regression analyses indicate that (controlling for a range of other social tie characteristics) same-faith ties are significantly more likely to be sources of help in times of need, while religious discussion is a strong predictor of receiving both help and advice. The effect of religious homophily is strongest for evangelical Protestants and African-American Protestants. My findings underscore the need for social support researchers to consider the role of religion in shaping support processes in close relationships.

<title>Status Homophily, Sexual Identity, and Lesbian Social Ties</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2013.819244</url>
<snippet>The literature on friendship and social networks finds that individuals form social ties with people who are like thema much studied concept called homophily. However, few studies have explicitly examined sexual identity as a point of homophily. Scholars from multiple disciplines have long argued that sexuality influences the organization of our social worlds, yet most studies of friendship and social networks under-examine or overlook the influence of sexual identity. This study addresses that gap by looking at status homophily among lesbian social ties to examine the influence of sexual identity, as well as gender, race, class, and family, on their personal networks. Using survey data from 544 U.S. lesbian respondents, the findings make visible some of the factors and forces that shape social ties for lesbians. The results point to the importance of sexuality as an organizing element of social life, and suggest that studies that examine social networks or friendships more often make sexual identity, gender, and intersecting social locations a central focus.

<snippet>Based on a study of individuals playing online social network games (SNG), this article focuses on the opinions and practices of people who play Facebook games with family members. Gameplay is contextualized in terms of (1) the structures of SNG (which shape gameplay in specific ways) and (2) via the norms and expectations for family leisure activities and relationships (which shape the social interactions in specific ways). The study offers an indepth understanding of social network gameplay within the context of existing family - rather than friend - networks; as issues of trust and obligation come to the forefront through family ties. This study illustrates that SNGs offer new spaces for purposive leisure for families that transcends geographical boundaries.

<title>Social Homophily in Middle School. Friendships and Enmities between Socially Distant Students in four French Middle Schools</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Most studies of degrees of social mix in middle school focus on individual schools' socio-occupational composition (i.e., the socio-occupational statuses of their students' parents). But little is known about relations between students within socially mixed schools. One question that arises in this connection is social homophily; i.e., the propensity to have friends of social backgrounds close to one's own. This article analyses the social networks of 861 students from their first to fourth years of middle school in four French schools characterized by strong social mix. It measures the impact of sociooccupational background on their friendships and enmities and compares that to the impacts of other homophily factors (gender, grades [academic performance], migrant status and, if applicable, migrant origin). It finds, first, that social homophily does exist in middle school and is more pronounced for strong friendships and friendships that extend beyond the school environment than for those confined to it. Second, social background does not seem to have a significant effect on student enmities. Third, homophily strength varies considerably from one school to another, suggesting an important role for local school context.

<title>The role of reciprocation in social network formation, with an application to LiveJournal</title>

<snippet>This paper deals with the role of reciprocation in the formation of individuals' social networks. We follow the activity of a panel of bloggers over more than a year and investigate the extent to which initiating a relation brings about its reciprocation. We adapt a standard capital investment model to study how reciprocation affects the build-up of the individual social capital of bloggers, as measured by their links and interactions with others. This allows us to measure the role of content production and relationship building in the dynamics of online social networks and to distinguish between the social networking and media aspects of blogging.

<title>The polarization of "La Manada": the public debate in Spain and the risks of digital political communication</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.11606/0103-2070.TS.2019.159680</url>
<snippet>Several authors have raised in recent years that the new scenario generated by digital communication causes citizens to have a role with greater prominence in the public debate. However, apart from the multiple political and communicative opportunities arising from the irruption of digital social networks, we find some risks and limitations relevant to political communication such as lack of civility (Incivility). The objective of this research is to analyze, through the study of the case of "La Manada" (of great social and political repercussion in Spain) and making use of Big data techniques, the possible polarization of public debate in the social network Twitter and the existence of this type of negative practices, especially when they affect women. We find a scenario of extreme polarization in which both parties tend to use the subject of debate as a pretext to reinforce the positions that separate the left and the right in Spain.

<title>Local/Global contagion of viral/non-viral information: Analysis of contagion spread in online social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230811</url>
<snippet>Contagion in online social networks (OSN) occurs when users are exposed to information disseminated by other users. Studies of contagion are largely devoted to the spread of viral information and to local neighbor-to-neighbor contagion. However, many contagion events can be non-viral in the sense of being unpopular with low reach size, or global in the sense of being exposed to non-adjacent neighbors. This study aims to investigate the differences between local and global contagion and the different contagion patterns of viral vs. non-viral information. We analyzed three datasets and found significant differences between the temporal spreading patterns of local contagion compared to global contagion. Based on our analysis, we can successfully predict whether a user will be infected by either a local or a global contagion. We achieve an F-1-score of 0.87 for non-viral information and an F-1-score of 0.84 for viral information. We propose a novel method for early detection of the viral potential of an information nugget and investigate the spreading of viral and non-viral information. In addition, we analyze both viral and non-viral contagion of a topic. Differentiating between local versus global contagion, as well as between viral versus non-viral information, provides a novel perspective and better understanding of information diffusion in OSNs.

<title>Association Between Social Networks and Subjective Well-Being in Adolescents: A Systematic Review</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0044118X20919589</url>
<snippet>Social networks are ubiquitous in the lives of adolescents. This work systematically reviewed all studies which investigated the relationship between subjective well-being and the social networks of adolescents. Twenty-nine articles (out of 1,204 hits) were included within the review. Offline social networks have a positive association between the mood, self-esteem, and loneliness of adolescents but not body image. Nine of the studies investigating online social networks found a positive association on mood, life satisfaction, and loneliness through support seeking and receiving positive feedback. Fifteen of the studies found a negative association between online social networks and mood, self-esteem, life satisfaction, body image, and overall subjective well-being through high investment, passive use, receiving negative feedback, and social media ostracism. There is a need for intervention programs and education for young people, educators, and parents to address the risks to subjective well-being brought about by online social networks.

<title>Beyond network centrality: individual-level behavioral traits for predicting information superspreaders in social media</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwae073</url>
<snippet>Understanding the heterogeneous role of individuals in large-scale information spreading is essential to manage online behavior as well as its potential offline consequences. To this end, most existing studies from diverse research domains focus on the disproportionate role played by highly connected 'hub' individuals. However, we demonstrate here that information superspreaders in online social media are best understood and predicted by simultaneously considering two individual-level behavioral traits: influence and susceptibility. Specifically, we derive a nonlinear network-based algorithm to quantify individuals' influence and susceptibility from multiple spreading event data. By applying the algorithm to large-scale data from Twitter and Weibo, we demonstrate that individuals' estimated influence and susceptibility scores enable predictions of future superspreaders above and beyond network centrality, and reveal new insights into the network positions of the superspreaders. While many works measured the role of social hubs for information spreading in social media, a new algorithm reveals that anticipating future superspreaders requires both individual characteristics and network structure.

<title>Corporate competition: A self-organized network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2011.05.004</url>
<snippet>A substantial number of studies have extended the work on universal properties in physical systems to complex networks in social, biological, and technological systems. In this paper, we present a complex networks perspective on interfirm organizational networks by mapping, analyzing and modeling the spatial structure of a large interfirm competition network across a variety of sectors and industries within the United States. We propose two micro-dynamic models that are able to reproduce empirically observed characteristics of competition networks as a natural outcome of a minimal set of general mechanisms governing the formation of competition networks. Both models, which utilize different approaches yet apply common principles to network formation give comparable results. There is an asymmetry between companies that are considered competitors, and companies that consider others as their competitors. All companies only consider a small number of other companies as competitors; however, there are a few companies that are considered as competitors by many others. Geographically, the density of corporate headquarters strongly correlates with local population density, and the probability two firms are competitors declines with geographic distance. We construct these properties by growing a corporate network with competitive links using random incorporations modulated by population density and geographic distance. Our new analysis, methodology and empirical results are relevant to various phenomena of social and market behavior, and have implications to research fields such as economic geography, economic sociology, and regional economic development.

<title>Missing link prediction and spurious link detection based on attractive force and community</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00368504211018558</url>
<snippet>With the rapid development of Internet and information technology, networks have become an important media of information diffusion in the global. In view of the increasing scale of network data, how to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the obtainable links from networks has been an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Different from most traditional link prediction methods only focus on the missing links, a novel link prediction approach is proposed in this paper to handle both the missing links and the spurious links in networks. At first, we define the attractive force for any pair of nodes to denote the strength of the relation between them. Then, all the nodes can be divided into some communities according to their degrees and the attractive force on them. Next, we define the connection probability for each pair of unconnected nodes to measure the possibility if they are connected, the missing links can be predicted by calculating and comparing the connection probabilities of all the pairs of unconnected nodes. Moreover, we define the break probability for each pair of connected nodes to measure the possibility if they are broken, the spurious links can also be detected by calculating and comparing the break probabilities of all the pairs of connected nodes. To verify the validity of the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on some real-world networks. The results show the proposed approach can achieve higher prediction accuracy and more stable performance compared with some existing methods.

<title>Exploring the construction and infiltration strategies of social bots in sina microblog</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76814-8</url>
<snippet>Nowadays, millions of people use Online Social Networks (OSNs) like Twitter, Facebook and Sina Microblog, to express opinions on current events. The widespread use of these OSNs has also led to the emergence of social bots. What is more, the existence of social bots is so powerful that some of them can turn into influential users. In this paper, we studied the automated construction technology and infiltration strategies of social bots in Sina Microblog, aiming at building friendly and influential social bots to resist malicious interpretations. Firstly, we studied the critical technology of Sina Microblog data collection, which indicates that the defense mechanism of that is vulnerable. Then, we constructed 96 social bots in Sina Microblog and researched the influence of different infiltration strategies, like different attribute settings and various types of interactions. Finally, our social bots gained 5546 followers in the 42-day infiltration period with a 100&#37; survival rate. The results show that the infiltration strategies we proposed are effective and can help social bots escape detection of Sina Microblog defense mechanism as well. The study in this paper sounds an alarm for Sina Microblog defense mechanism and provides a valuable reference for social bots detection.

<title>Cross-Talk: The Role of Homophily and Elite Bias in Civic Associations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>We examine the manner in which voluntary associations expose individuals to differing perspectives, or "cross-talk." Specifically we develop hypotheses based on the interactive roles of elite bias and homophily in structuring networks of democratic participation and test them on social network data of Los Angeles neighborhood councils. We find that homophily leads to boards less diverse than their communities, but does not lead to homogeneous cliques within boards. Moreover, we find that elite bias and homophily counteract each other in lower-status communities, leading to more diverse boards than would be predicted by homophily alone. We then examine the effects of assortative mixing on political attitudes and collective action, and find weak support for the proposition that associational diversity promotes tolerance and access to information.

<title>Network structure and economic prosperity in municipalities: A large-scale test of social capital theory using social media data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2017.06.002</url>
<snippet>In this study, we analyze the relationship between network structure and economic prosperity in 438 Dutch municipalities. We focus on the structural aspects of social capital theory and test how three forms of social capital- network density, fragmentation (bonding), diversity and geographical distance of ties (bridging)- are associated with economic prosperity at the municipality level. We use data from a Dutch online social network that consists of more than 10 million users to test the hypotheses. We find that communities that have high network diversity are also more prosperous economically, while high network fragmentation is associated with lower prosperity. Contrary to previous literature, we find some support that network density at the community level is negatively associated with economic prosperity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Gender inequities in the online dissemination of scholars' work</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2102945118</url>
<snippet>Unbiased science dissemination has the potential to alleviate some of the known gender disparities in academia by exposing female scholars' work to other scientists and the public. And yet, we lack comprehensive understanding of the relationship between gender and science dissemination online. Our largescale analyses, encompassing half a million scholars, revealed that female scholars' work is mentioned less frequently than male scholars' work in all research areas. When exploring the characteristics associated with online success, we found that the impact of prior work, social capital, and gendered tie formation in coauthorship networks are linked with online success for men, but not for women-even in the areas with the highest female representation. These results suggest that while men's scientific impact and collaboration networks are associated with higher visibility online, there are no universally identifiable facets associated with success for women. Our comprehensive empirical evidence indicates that the gender gap in online science dissemination is coupled with a lack of understanding the characteristics that are linked with female scholars' success, which might hinder efforts to close the gender gap in visibility.

<title>Mental disorder recovery correlated with centralities and interactions on an online social network</title>

<snippet>Recent research has established both a theoretical basis and strong empirical evidence that effective social behavior plays a beneficial role in the maintenance of physical and psychological well-being of people. To test whether social behavior and well-being are also associated in online communities, we studied the correlations between the recovery of patients with mental disorders and their behaviors in online social media. As the source of the data related to the social behavior and progress of mental recovery, we used PatientsLikeMe (PLM), the world's first open-participation research platformfor the development of patient-centered health outcome measures. We first constructed an online social network structure based on patient-to-patient ties among 200 patients obtained from PLM. We then characterized patients' online social activities by measuring the numbers of "posts and views" and " helpful marks" each patient obtained. The patients' recovery data were obtained from their self-reported status information that was also available on PLM. We found that some node properties (in-degree, eigenvector centrality and PageRank) and the two online social activity measures were significantly correlated with patients' recovery. Furthermore, we re-collected the patients' recovery data two months after the first data collection. We found significant correlations between the patients' social behaviors and the second recovery data, which were collected two months apart. Our results indicated that social interactions in online communities such as PLM were significantly associated with the current and future recoveries of patients with mental disorders.

<title>Similarity in functional brain connectivity at rest predicts interpersonal closeness in the social network of an entire village</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2013606117</url>
<snippet>People often have the intuition that they are similar to their friends, yet evidence for homophily (being friends with similar others) based on self-reported personality is inconsistent. Functional connectomes-patterns of spontaneous synchronization across the brain-are stable within individuals and predict how people tend to think and behave. Thus, they may capture interindividual variability in latent traits that are particularly similar among friends but that might elude self-report. Here, we examined interpersonal similarity in functional connectivity at rest-that is, in the absence of external stimuli-and tested if functional connectome similarity is associated with proximity in a real-world social network. The social network of a remote village was reconstructed; a subset of residents underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Similarity in functional connectomes was positively related to social network proximity, particularly in the default mode network. Controlling for similarities in demographic and personality data (the Big Five personality traits) yielded similar results. Thus, functional connectomes may capture latent interpersonal similarities between friends that are not fully captured by commonly used demographic or personality measures. The localization of these results suggests how friendsmay be particularly similar to one another. Additionally, geographic proximity moderated the relationship between neural similarity and social network proximity, suggesting that such associations are particularly strong among people who live particularly close to one another. These findings suggest that social connectivity is reflected in signatures of brain functional connectivity, consistent with the common intuition that friends share similarities that go beyond, for example, demographic similarities.

<title>Replay shapes abstract cognitive maps for efficient social navigation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-01990-w</url>
<snippet>To make adaptive social decisions, people must anticipate how information flows through their social network. While this requires knowledge of how people are connected, networks are too large to have first-hand experience with every possible route between individuals. How, then, are people able to accurately track information flow through social networks? Here we find that people immediately cache abstract knowledge about social network structure as they learn who is friends with whom, which enables the identification of efficient routes between remotely connected individuals. These cognitive maps of social networks, which are built while learning, are then reshaped through overnight rest. During these extended periods of rest, a replay-like mechanism helps to make these maps increasingly abstract, which privileges improvements in social navigation accuracy for the longest communication paths that span distinct communities within the network. Together, these findings provide mechanistic insight into the sophisticated mental representations humans use for social navigation. How do people track information flow through social networks? New research finds that extended periods of rest, such as sleep, help people build abstract cognitive maps that identify efficient routes between remotely connected network members.

<title>Facebook Users' Satisfaction and Intention to Continue Using It: Applying the Expectation Confirmation Model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393211066584</url>
<snippet>The use of social media for health communication has grown enormously worldwide. Whilst research concerning the potential benefits and barriers of using social media is rich and ever expanding, only a few studies looked at the fundamental reasons why social networking users continue to use Facebook for accessing health-related support groups and communicating with the healthcare professionals. Based on the expectation confirmation model (ECM), this study aims to uncover the factors that explain users' intention to continue using Facebook for health-related matters. A sample size of 239 respondents was collected to test the proposed theoretical framework, using thestructural equation modelling technique. Our findings indicate that the most important drivers of continuance intention of Facebook are satisfaction, perceived usefulness, information quality and social support, whilst confirmation of expectation, information quality and social support are determinants of satisfaction. This study offers new insights into the domain of post-technology adoption and health communication literature. It also provides important information for healthcare providers on how to improve the effectiveness of social network-based interactions.

<snippet>How might people's moment-to-moment feelings influence the social network contacts they call to mind? Three datasets indicate that experiencing positive affect leads people to cognitively activate larger and more sparsely connected social network structures, while experiencing negative affect leads them to activate smaller, redundant social network structures. A preliminary association emerged between positive affect and activating large, diversified network structures in the General Social Survey. To isolate causality, we then conducted two experiments where we randomly assigned participants to experience either positive or negative affect. Both studies supported the hypothesized relationship between affect and cognitive network activation. These findings contribute to a burgeoning literature examining how psychological states shape the activation of social network structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Stewardship of global collective behavior</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2025764118</url>
<snippet>Collective behavior provides a framework for understanding how the actions and properties of groups emerge from the way individuals generate and share information. In humans, information flows were initially shaped by natural selection yet are increasingly structured by emerging communication technologies. Our larger, more complex social networks now transfer high-fidelity information over vast distances at low cost. The digital age and the rise of social media have accelerated changes to our social systems, with poorly understood functional consequences. This gap in our knowledge represents a principal challenge to scientific progress, democracy, and actions to address global crises. We argue that the study of collective behavior must rise to a "crisis discipline" just as medicine, conservation, and climate science have, with a focus on providing actionable insight to policymakers and regulators for the stewardship of social systems.

<title>Can celebrity athletes burst the echo chamber bubble? The case of LeBron James and Lady Gaga</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1012690219855913</url>
<snippet>This study examines the case of basketball superstar LeBron James, who openly identifies as a liberal. Our analysis of LeBron James' Twitter profile revealed normal distribution between liberals and conservatives following his account. We then compared James' followers' distribution to those of the singer Lady Gaga and liberal-tilting sport network ESPN and found that James' followers' distribution represented the most diverse distribution of the three accounts. We further found that James was the only liberal source in most of his conservative followers' profiles. The findings highlight the potency of celebrity athletes to narrow the trend of political polarization.

<title>Three dimensions of the public sphere on Facebook</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1281329</url>
<snippet>The article provides an empirical analysis of the online public sphere in the three dimensions introduced by Dahlgren (2005): structural, representational and interactional. The main subject of analysis is the largest social networking site - Facebook - and Polish users' activity on the Facebook Pages of political parties and politicians. The researchers analysed data about all users active on those Pages during two 4-month periods in 2013 and 2015. The results of the study show that only a small fraction of Facebook users are active in public political discussions that take place on political Facebook Pages (structural dimension). However, the level of engagement depends on the current political events taking place within the public sphere offline, and users are more active during electoral campaigns. Moreover, Facebook does not provide an alternative public sphere for political actors that are less present in mainstream media. Parties and politicians that are visible in traditional media are also attracting active fans in social media (representational dimension). Nonetheless, non-parliamentary groups have more active fans than would result only from their popularity in mainstream media. Finally, the online public on Facebook is fragmented and clustered into homogenous political groups (interactional dimension), thus supporting the hypothesis on echo chambers' presented by Sunstein (2001). The divisions are smaller when there are significantly more users involved. However, most of these cross-cutting links are the result of the electoral campaign.

<title>Networked Identity: How Immigrant Youth Employ Online Identity Resources</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1103308814557396</url>
<snippet>In recent years, practices of online social networking and their implications for migrant youth identity development have been heavily debated. The nature of access to resources for identification is changing, and by using a social network perspective, this research conceptualizes identity as a networked phenomenon in which resources are understood as specific kinds of social formations: identity networks. Social network interviews were conducted with Dutch-Moroccan inner-city teenagers, probing their online and offline identity practices as related to their actual social networks. Social network analysis was applied, assuming that structural properties of networks affect behaviour; they can limit or shape, but do not fully determine the actions that individuals can engage in. By combining numeric, discursive and visual data, we aim to understand how structural and compositional aspects of networks are related to the ways in which youth create opportunities for identity development. Four network types, with associated (online) identity practices, are presented.

<title>Effects of user behaviors on accumulation of social capital in an online social network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231837</url>
<snippet>The use of social network sites helps people to make and maintain social ties accumulating social capital, which is increasingly important for individual success. There is a wide variation in the amount and structure of online ties, and to some extent this variation is contingent on specific online user behaviors which are to date under-researched. In this work, we examine an entire city-bounded friendship network (N = 194,601) extracted from VK social network site to explore how specific online user behaviors are related to structural social capital in a network of geographically proximate ties. Social network analysis was used to evaluate individual social capital as a network asset, and multiple regression analysis-to determine and estimate the effects of online user behaviors on social capital. The analysis reveals that the graph is both clustered and highly centralized which suggests the presence of a hierarchical structure: a set of sub-communities united by city-level hubs. Against this background, membership in more online groups is positively associated with user's brokerage in the location-bounded network. Additionally, the share of local friends, the number of received likes and the duration of SNS use are associated with social capital indicators. This contributes to the literature on the formation of online social capital, examined at the level of a large and geographically localized population.

<title>Motivation vs. relevance: Using strong ties to find a job in Urban China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2011.12.010</url>
<snippet>While the idea that contacts matter in finding a job is intuitively appealing, we still do not know-after decades of research-how and why strong ties benefit job seekers. To resolve this confusion, we need to theorize how specific characteristics of ties are related to the mechanisms that make job search through contacts effective. We have reasons to expect that, while a contact's motivation influences the likelihood that a job seeker receives an offer, her homophily with the job seeker on occupation and other job-relevant attributes influences the quality of the offer. The use of strong ties among university students to find jobs in China provides a unique opportunity to empirically isolate the relationship between contact characteristics and the mechanisms through which contacts benefit the job seeker. I tested my hypotheses with data on both the successful and unsuccessful job searches of 478 graduates of China's flagship universities, who, as first-time job seekers, primarily used strong ties. Survey results are consistent with my hypotheses: job seekers who used strong ties to look for jobs had more offers-but not better offers-than those who used only formal methods.

<title>Insights into elections: An ensemble bot detection coverage framework applied to the 2018 US midterm elections</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244309</url>
<snippet>The participation of automated software agents known as social bots within online social network (OSN) engagements continues to grow at an immense pace. Choruses of concern speculate as to the impact social bots have within online communications as evidence shows that an increasing number of individuals are turning to OSNs as a primary source for information. This automated interaction proliferation within OSNs has led to the emergence of social bot detection efforts to better understand the extent and behavior of social bots. While rapidly evolving and continually improving, current social bot detection efforts are quite varied in their design and performance characteristics. Therefore, social bot research efforts that rely upon only a single bot detection source will produce very limited results. Our study expands beyond the limitation of current social bot detection research by introducing an ensemble bot detection coverage framework that harnesses the power of multiple detection sources to detect a wider variety of bots within a given OSN corpus of Twitter data. To test this framework, we focused on identifying social bot activity within OSN interactions taking place on Twitter related to the 2018 U.S. Midterm Election by using three available bot detection sources. This approach clearly showed that minimal overlap existed between the bot accounts detected within the same tweet corpus. Our findings suggest that social bot research efforts must incorporate multiple detection sources to account for the variety of social bots operating in OSNs, while incorporating improved or new detection methods to keep pace with the constant evolution of bot complexity.

<title>Subjective Poverty, Material Deprivation Indices and Psychological Distress Among Young Adults: The Mediating Role of Social Capital and Usage of Online Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-021-02729-0</url>
<snippet>The mechanisms underlying the SES-psychological distress association are not fully explored. Based on representative cross-sectional data from Israel for the year 2017 (N = 1508), we examine (1) the association between subjective poverty, material deprivation, social capital, and psychological distress among young adults (20-29 years); and (2) whether social capital mediates the subjective poverty/material deprivation-psychological distress association. Informal social capital includes connections with family and friends, perceived support, and perceived trust, whereas formal social capital includes volunteering and civic and political involvement. An additional aspect was online social network usage. We constructed a structural equation model to explore paths of relationships between subjective poverty, material deprivation, social capital, and psychological distress. Subjective poverty and material deprivation were strong predictors of psychological distress. Informal social capital buffered the negative effect of subjective poverty and material deprivations on psychological distress, whereas use of online social networks increased it. The use of online social networks, however, promoted informal social capital, which, in turn, was a protective factor against psychological distress. Further investigation is needed on which patterns and platforms of online social networks harm and which promote young adults' psychological wellbeing. Informal social capital should be a prominent aspect of both preventive medicine practice and health promotion initiatives among young adults. Policy-makers are called on to support this important means of promoting public health. However, to substantially narrow disparities in psychological distress among young adults, direct action should be taken to reduce poverty and material deprivation.

<title>Distributive effervescence: emotional energy and social cohesion in secularizing societies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11186-021-09470-0</url>
<snippet>Research suggests that societies are becoming more materially secure, less intensely religious and that social interactions are increasingly computer mediated. However, sociological theorists have not yet developed robust mechanistic theories explaining how social cohesion might be generated under these new conditions. This is a notable omission because scholars have demonstrated empirically that materially secure, non-religious, people tend to be more individualistic, have more diverse networks, and are less socially engaged than traditionally religious individuals (Zuckerman et al., The nonreligious: Understanding secular people and societies, Oxford University Press, 2016). Does the secularization of societies necessarily imply societal instability, anomie, or isolation? If not, why not? Here, we posit the existence of a continuum of modes of social cohesion that are characterized by a suite of historically contingent variables which impact the volume, scope, and rate of human interactions. This novel theory of "distributive effervescence" specifies how emotional energy might be generated via punctuated interactions with heterogeneous others across diverse settings.

<title>Warranting theory, stereotypes, and intercultural communication: US Americans' perceptions of a target Chinese on Facebook</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2020.04.005</url>
<snippet>Extending prior literature on stereotypes about ethnic groups and warranting theory, this experimental study examined the effects of exposure to a target Chinese international student's Facebook page with self-generated (stereotypically positive or negative) and/or other-generated wall posts (stereotypically positive or negative) on U.S. participants' (N = 550, M-age = 21.38, SD = 3.82) perceptions of task attractiveness and behavioral tendencies (i.e., willingness to communicate/ cooperate) toward the target. Supporting warranting theory, results demonstrated that when other-generated posts were present and disconfirmed the Facebook page owner's self-generated posts, other-generated posts mitigated the effects of self-generated posts in most cases. However, when other-generated and self-generated wall posts were consistent, other-generated posts produced an averaging effect. In addition, the type of dependent measure, and the dynamic interplay between stereotype content and the valence of self-generated posts also mitigated the warranting effect of other-generated posts.

<title>RETRACTED: Mediating Effect of Organizational Learning Capacity on the Relationship between Relational Embeddedness and Innovation Performance in Freight Logistics Service (Retracted Article)</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/5516599</url>
<snippet>Cooperative innovation has become a critical method for freight logistics firms in supply chain management. The previous study has proved that relational embeddedness (RE) has a positive effect on service innovation performance. However, the influence of organizational learning capacity (OLC) has been widely ignored. This study focuses on explaining the mechanism of OLC on the relationship between RE and innovation performance of freight logistics service (IPFLS). Firstly, a theoretical model is constructed based on Social Network Theory, and four research hypotheses are presented. Secondly, a sample of 236 respondents from freight logistics firms in China is analyzed to test the hypotheses. Finally, several management implications and recommendations are suggested. The research results demonstrate that both RE and OLC have positive effects on IPFLS. Meanwhile, OLC partially mediates the relationship between RE and IPFLS. The findings provide practical guidance for managers to strengthen the relationship with partners and enhance OLC.

<title>Connected seniors: how older adults in East York exchange social support online and offline</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1305428</url>
<snippet>How do older adults mobilize social support, with and without digital media? To investigate this, we focus on older adults 65+ residing in the Toronto locality of East York, using 42 interviews lasting about 90 minutes done in 2013-2014. We find that digital media help in mobilizing social support as well as maintaining and strengthening existing relationships with geographically near and distant contacts. This is especially important for those individuals (and their network members) who have limited mobility. Once older adults start using digital media, they become routinely incorporated into their lives, used in conjunction with the telephone to maintain existing relationships but not to develop new ones. Contradicting fears that digital media are inadequate for meaningful relational contact, we found that these older adults considered social support exchanged via digital media to be real support that cannot be dismissed as token. Older adults especially used and valued digital media for companionship. They also used them for coordination, maintaining ties, and casual conversations. Email was used more with friends than relatives; some Skype was used with close family ties. Our research suggests that policy efforts need to emphasize the strengthening of existing networks rather than the establishment of interventions that are outside of older adults' existing ties. Our findings also show that learning how to master technology is in itself a form of social support that provides opportunities to strengthen the networks of older adults.

<title>A new look at clustering coefficients with generalization to weighted and multi-faction networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2017.08.003</url>
<snippet>In this paper we propose a new method for studying local and global clustering in networks employing random walk pairs. The method is intuitive and directly generalizes standard local and global clustering coefficients to weighted networks and networks containing nodes of multiple types. In the case of two mode networks the values obtained for commonly considered social networks are in sharp contrast to those obtained, for instance, by the method of Opsahl (2013), and provide a different viewpoint for clustering. The approach is also applicable in questions related to the general study of segregation and homophily. Applications to existent data sets are considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Affective Ties That Bind: Investigating the Affordances of Social Networking Sites for Commemoration of Traumatic Events</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439318770960</url>
<snippet>Social networking sites (SNSs) facilitate self-expression and promote social connections. There has been growing scholarly attention to the affect-charged collectivities created online in the aftermath of disasters and mass traumas. This study was designed to examine how individuals affiliate in SNS-based commemoration of a mass trauma, taking advantage of a large Weibo (the Chinese equivalent of Twitter) data set which captures users' responses over 4 years to the anniversary of the Nanjing massacre, a major traumatic event in Chinese history. Machine learning-based content analysis was combined with dyadic-level network analysis to examine the content Weibo users create and the conversational structures they formed. The results reveal that homophily, geographic proximity, and preferential attachment work in tandem with displays of emotion to influence the formation of online conversational ties. Expressions of negative emotions were found to facilitate or inhibit the homophily effect. Being exposed to the display of anger amplifies the homophily effect among the users, while sadness weakens it. The findings point to the importance of examining specific emotions rather than global (positive-negative) feelings in understanding the dynamics of SNS-based interaction.

<title>HOW OFFLINE GATHERINGS AFFECT ONLINE COMMUNITIES When virtual community members 'meetup'</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13691180903468954</url>
<snippet>This paper builds on past studies of virtual community by illuminating the effect of offline gatherings ('meetups') on physically dispersed virtual communities. Although research to date has examined the way in which online interaction affects offline community, the question of how offline interaction affects online community has largely been ignored. On the one hand, these offline gatherings may provide individual benefits for members as the development of relationships strengthens social ties, leading to the creation of bonding social capital. However, these gatherings do not necessarily benefit the community at large as the resources found in weak ties may be sacrificed as attendees favour interaction with one another to the detriment of those that do not attend meetups. Non-obtrusive analysis of over eight years of user activity from a large, active online community suggests that the development of multiplex relationships - relationships maintained both online and offline enhances attendees' engagement with the online community as a whole, strengthens ties to other attendees, and contributes to the creation of bonding social capital. However, weak ties with non-attendees dissolve and bridging social capital is sacrificed as those who meet offline favour interaction with other attendees.

<title>Social Media Effects on Public Trust in the European Union</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfad029</url>
<snippet>This paper scrutinizes the effect of social media use on institutional trust in the European Union (EU) among European citizens. Fixed-effects regression models on data from the Eurobarometer survey conducted in 2019, the year of the most recent European Parliament (EP) elections, demonstrate that higher social media use is associated with lower trust in the EU. More importantly, social media usage habits exert particularly detrimental effects in regions with wider and faster internet connections. In such high-information environments, those who more frequently use online social networks, tend to trust those networks, and receive information on EU affairs from these networks have less faith in the EU compared to those in regions with lower-quality internet access. In contrast, in regions with lower broadband access, receiving EU information from social media fosters political trust.

<title>Popularity Evaluation Model for Microbloggers Online Social Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/356072</url>
<snippet>Recently, microblogging is widely studied by the researchers in the domain of the online social network (OSN). How to evaluate the popularities of microblogging users is an important research field, which can be applied to commercial advertising, user behavior analysis and information dissemination, and so forth. Previous studies on the evaluation methods cannot effectively solve and accurately evaluate the popularities of the microbloggers. In this paper, we proposed an electromagnetic field theory based model to analyze the popularities of microbloggers. The concept of the source in microblogging field is first put forward, which is based on the concept of source in the electromagnetic field; then, one's microblogging flux is calculated according to his/her behaviors (send or receive feedbacks) on the microblogging platform; finally, we used three methods to calculate one's microblogging flux density, which can represent one's popularity on the microblogging platform. In the experimental work, we evaluated our model using real microblogging data and selected the best one from the three popularity measure methods. We also compared our model with the classic PageRank algorithm; and the results show that our model is more effective and accurate to evaluate the popularities of the microbloggers.

<title>Distortions of political bias in crowdsourced misinformation flagging</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0020</url>
<snippet>Many people view news on social media, yet the production of news items online has come under fire because of the common spreading of misinformation. Social media platforms police their content in various ways. Primarily they rely on crowdsourced 'flags': users signal to the platform that a specific news item might be misleading and, if they raise enough of them, the item will be fact-checked. However, real-world data show that the most flagged news sources are also the most popular and-supposedly-reliable ones. In this paper, we show that this phenomenon can be explained by the unreasonable assumptions that current content policing strategies make about how the online social media environment is shaped. The most realistic assumption is that confirmation bias will prevent a user from flagging a news item if they share the same political bias as the news source producing it. We show, via agent-based simulations, that a model reproducing our current understanding of the social media environment will necessarily result in the most neutral and accurate sources receiving most flags.

<title>Network Structure of an AIDS-Denialist Online Community: Identifying Core Members and the Risk Group</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764217717565</url>
<snippet>With rapid growth of online social network sites, the issue of health-related online communities and its social and behavioral implications has become increasingly important for public health. Unfortunately, online communities often become vehicles for promotion of pernicious misinformation, in particular, that HIV virus is a myth (AIDS denialism). This study seeks to explore online users' behavior and interactions within AIDS-denialist community to identify and estimate the number of those, who potentially are most susceptible to AIDS-denialist argumentsthe risk group in terms of becoming AIDS denialists. Social network analysis was used for examining the most numerous AIDS-denialist community (over 15,000 members) in the most popular Russian SNS VK.com. In addition, content analysis was used for collecting data on attitudes toward AIDS-denialist arguments and participants' self-disclosed HIV status. Two data sets were collected to analyze friendship ties and communication interactions among community members. We have identified the core of online communitycohesive and dedicated AIDS denialists, and the risk group: users who communicate with core members, and, thus, can be more susceptible to the AIDS-denialist propaganda and their health behaviors (e.g., refusing treatment). Analysis allowed to significantly reduce the target audience for possible intervention campaigns and simultaneously increase the accuracy of determining the risk group composition.

<title>Empirical analysis of structural properties, macroscopic and microscopic evolution of various Facebook activity networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-016-0465-4</url>
<snippet>Recently, some works have been done in studying activity network as a more realistic representation of users' behavior in online social networks. However, there is a major deficiency of a suitable definition of activity network based on a comprehensive study of various activity networks separately and combined. The main purpose of our research is to understand the differences between users' behavior by various Facebook activities, so as to claim that these networks should not be blindly composed; neither should the result of analyzing each of them individually be generalized to others. For this purpose, degree distribution, small-world phenomenon, degree correlation, reciprocity, and homophily by different attributes of various activity networks are studied. Then, we study densification and shrinking diameter properties and some structural characteristics of activity networks over time. We also examine microscopic evolution of different activity networks. Ultimately, we conclude that there are some differences between users' behavior by various Facebook activities but all evolve almost similarly at macroscopic and microscopic levels. However, post network evolves considerably different from other activity networks. Accordingly, a comprehensive definition for activity network is suggested so that the results of analyzing the modeled activity network fit realistic data.

<title>Peer relations and access to capital in the mathematics classroom: a Bourdieusian social network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01425692.2016.1245129</url>
<snippet>The aim of this article is to explore the structure of social capital in peer networks and its relation to the unequal access of educational resources within mathematics classrooms. We hypothesise that learners can gain access to mathematics through friendship networks which provide more or less help from peers that might sustain (or curtail) their mathematics learning based on a Bourdieusian framework. We report a social network analysis of mutually-recognised helping within friendship groups. This is complemented by observation and interviews that illustrate how different classrooms have different network structures, positioning learners of different ethnic minorities and genders in significantly different ways regarding access to learning. We argue that friendship networks mediate social capital and access to further cultural capital, and that this may help explain structural differences in attainment. Because ethnicity and gender, inter alia, mediate friendship networks, they also mediate access to capital in the classroom.

<title>Behavioral and environmental contributions to drosophilid social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1920642117</url>
<snippet>Animals interact with each other in species-specific reproducible patterns. These patterns of organization are captured by social network analysis, and social interaction networks (SINs) have been described for a wide variety of species including fish, insects, birds, and mammals. The aim of this study is to understand the evolution of social organization in Drosophila. Using a comparative ecological, phylogenetic, and behavioral approach, the different properties of SINs formed by 20 drosophilids were compared. We investigate whether drosophilid network structures arise from common ancestry, a response to the species' past climate, other social behaviors, or a combination of these factors. This study shows that differences in past climate predicted the species' current SIN properties. The drosophilid phylogeny offered no value to predicting species' differences in SINs through phylogenetic signal tests. This suggests that group-level social behaviors in drosophilid species are shaped by divergent climates. However, we find that the social distance at which flies interact correlated with the drosophilid phylogeny, indicating that behavioral elements of SINs have remained largely unchanged in their evolutionary history. We find a significant correlation of leg length to social distance, outlining the interdependence of anatomy and complex social structures. Although SINs display a complex evolutionary relationship across drosophilids, this study suggests that the ecology, and not common ancestry, contributes to diversity in social structure in Drosophila.

<title>Diversity and Social Network Structure in Collective Decision Making: Evolutionary Perspectives with Agent-Based Simulations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/7591072</url>
<snippet>Collective, especially group-based, managerial decision making is crucial in organizations. Using an evolutionary theoretic approach to collective decision making, agent-based simulations were conducted to investigate how human collective decision making would be affected by the agents' diversity in problem understanding and/or behavior in discussion, as well as by their social network structure. Simulation results indicated that groups with consistent problem understanding tended to produce higher utility values of ideas and displayed better decision convergence, but only if there was no group-level bias in collective problem understanding. Simulation results also indicated the importance of balance between selection-oriented (i.e., exploitative) and variation-oriented (i.e., explorative) behaviors in discussion to achieve quality final decisions. Expanding the group size and introducing nontrivial social network structure generally improved the quality of ideas at the cost of decision convergence. Simulations with different social network topologies revealed collective decision making on small-world networks with high local clustering tended to achieve highest decision quality more often than on random or scale-free networks. Implications of this evolutionary theory and simulation approach for future managerial research on collective, group, and multilevel decision making are discussed.

<title>Why Do Young People Avoid Photo Tagging? A New Service Avoidance Scale</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439316653636</url>
<snippet>Despite the growing attention to the study of various issues concerning online self-presentation, little research has investigated the different reasons underlying the avoidance of online identity and presentation building features. Using a multistage investigation, this study has developed and validated a 25-item instrument for investigating the various reasons why young people avoid Facebook photo tagging. The instrument items were developed based on open-ended qualitative essays written by 141 Indian and Pakistani adolescents who use the Facebook photo-tagging service. From their qualitative responses, 38 items were first extracted and evaluated with 780 Indian adolescent photo taggers. This resulted in the development of a 25-item instrument which was reexamined a year later with 314 Indian adolescent and 106 young adult photo taggers. The study participants were recruited from India and Pakistan in order to address the criticism of previous Facebook research which is chiefly based on U.S.-only study samples. The developed instrument indicated six reasons: destruction of capital, dislike, worry, parental control, embarrassment, and personal appearance. The study results indicate that the developed instrument has a stable factorial structure, validity, and reliability over time. This new instrument offers various theoretical and practical implications for scholars engaged in research involving computer-mediated communication, online self-presentation, and young people.

<snippet>Social networking services are becoming parallel socialization universes. In these digital contexts, people tend to connect with others who share their perspectives and opinions about the world. Emerging voices are warning about the growing homophily resulting from these forms of socialization, which can have a negative impact on tolerance to diversity and the quality of social capital. Relational approach disciplines such as social work can provide digital skills and competences to improve the manner in which these services are used. In this article, the authors analyse how patterns of connectedness among social work graduates affect tolerance to diversity and social capital. A sample of 126 social work graduates was analysed to assess their connectedness patterns on Facebook. Participants were also asked about their digital competences and skills in order to know how these variables can mediate the achievement of tolerance to diversity and social capital. Results show that higher connectedness, when social work graduates have digital skills on Facebook, leads to higher tolerance to diversity and social capital. In order to counteract homophily, social workers must encourage users to acquire digital skills thus increasing tolerance for diversity.

<title>Filter Bubbles, Echo Chambers, and Online News Consumption</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfw006</url>
<snippet>Online publishing, social networks, and web search have dramatically lowered the costs of producing, distributing, and discovering news articles. Some scholars argue that such technological changes increase exposure to diverse perspectives, while others worry that they increase ideological segregation. We address the issue by examining web-browsing histories for 50,000 US-located users who regularly read online news. We find that social networks and search engines are associated with an increase in the mean ideological distance between individuals. However, somewhat counterintuitively, these same channels also are associated with an increase in an individual's exposure to material from his or her less preferred side of the political spectrum. Finally, the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets, tempering the consequences-both positive and negative-of recent technological changes. We thus uncover evidence for both sides of the debate, while also finding that the magnitude of the effects is relatively modest.

<title>Hyper-elite network building in Madagascar: amplification or compensatory strategy?</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwac045</url>
<snippet>Research has proved that social networks are unevenly distributed. Qualitative and theoretical work on elite networks raises the question: do they amplify or compensate for inequalities in the powerful other resources? We test these hypotheses using a unique dataset of hyper-elites in Madagascar. We identify three network dimensions: extent, quality and effectiveness. We find that elite groups disadvantaged in terms of social position are generally disadvantaged in terms of social networks. In particular, the caste system is still key to network building at the top. Homophily is the dominant bonding dynamic among elites. However, some compensatory mechanisms are in play. Socially disadvantaged elites tend to make more use of their networks. They also have more upwardly heterophilous potential and mobilized networks. The predominance of the elite network's amplifying role explains the prevalence of the elite reproduction dynamic. Newcomers, who represent a minority, are excluded from the highest decision-making bodies.

<title>Social network analysis and the implications for Pontocaspian biodiversity conservation in Romania and Ukraine: A comparative study</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0221833</url>
<snippet>Romania and Ukraine share the Black Sea coastline, the Danube Delta and associated habitats, which harbor the endemic, aquatic Pontocaspian biota. Currently, this biota is diminishing both in numbers of species and their abundance because of human activities, and its future persistence strongly depends on the adequacy of conservation measures. Romania and Ukraine have a common responsibility to address the conservation of Pontocaspian biodiversity. The two countries, however have different socio-political and legal conservation frameworks, which may result in differences in the social network structure of stakeholder institutions with different implications for Pontocaspian biodiversity conservation. Here, we study the social network structure of stakeholder organizations involved in conservation of Pontocaspian biodiversity in Romania and the implications of network structure for conservation outcomes. Then we compare the findings from Romania to an earlier similar study from Ukraine. We apply a mix of qualitative and quantitative social network analysis methods to combine the content and context of the interactions with relational measures. We show that Pontocaspian biodiversity plays a minor and mostly incidental role in the inter-organizational interactions in Romania. Furthermore, there is room for improvement in the network structure through e.g. more involvement of governmental and nongovernmental organizations and increased motivation of central stakeholders to initiate conservation actions. Social variables, such as lack of funding, hierarchical, non-inclusive system of conservation governance and continuous institutional reforms in the public sector are consequential for the network relations and structure. Social network of stakeholders in Ukraine is more connected and central stakeholders utilize their favorable positions. However, neither in Ukraine is the Pontocaspian biodiversity a driver of organizational interactions. Consequently, both networks translate into sub-optimal conservation actions and the roads to optimal conservation are different. We end with sketching out conservation implications and recommendations for improved national and cross-border conservation efforts.

<title>Misinformation on social platforms: A review and research Agenda</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102654</url>
<snippet>Social platforms contribute to various hedonic and informational needs of their users. However, the unregulated, ubiquitous, and unhindered nature of the platforms is intricately linked to the exponential rise of online misinformation. The complexities in governing misinformation, coupled with the growing distrust of users, have diminished its value proposition for all stakeholders. Hence, it is crucial for all stakeholders to examine the state of research in this domain. We aim to examine the core value-adding governance mechanisms through a systematic scoping literature review. We propose an overarching conceptual framework that integrates the drivers of governance mechanisms with the outcomes of effective misinformation governance. Additionally, the framework illustrates the moderation role of platform monitoring efficiency for effective governance. This study will be especially useful for platform designers and practitioners to identify avenues for introducing strategic interventions on their platform and for scholars to develop a holistic understanding of the overall knowledge base in this domain and thus identify existing gaps in the literature which are rich for future examination.

<title>Coming into relations: How communication reveals and persuades relational decisions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2024.05.003</url>
<snippet>Coming into relations involves exiting a state of indecision and deciding whether to relate or not. Little research has focused on these initial moments, the communications involved, and the making of a relational decision. We study this process using 947 speed dating encounters, their minute-by-minute communications, and the reported timing of relational decisions. We show that certain forms of communication reveal an actor's relational state of being undecided, desiring a relation, or not desiring a relation (revealing signals). For example, indecision corresponds with indirect and ambiguous communication (negative facework); desiring a relation entails positive, excited, and entraining communication (positive facework); and not desiring a relation involves routine talk. We also show that certain forms of communication persuade persons to transition relational states, moving beyond their indecision and coming to a relational decision (persuasive signals). Interestingly, only some revealing signals are persuasive and bring about corresponding relational decisions in others. These tend to be clear signals that cannot be attributed to the situation or politeness. Last, some signals persuade relational decisions without corresponding to a relational state. These performative signals are select forms of ambiguous communication that place the speaker in an advantaged position within social exchange.

<title>Dynamic social media affiliations among UK politicians</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.01.008</url>
<snippet>Inter-personal affiliations and coalitions are an important part of politicians' behaviour, but are often difficult to observe. Since an increasing amount of political communication now occurs online, data from online interactions may offer a new toolkit to study ties between politicians; however, the methods by which robust insights can be derived from online data require further development, especially around the dynamics of political social networks. We develop a novel method for tracking the evolution of community structures, referred to as 'multiplex community affiliation clustering' (MCAC), and use it to study the online social networks of Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in the United Kingdom. Social interaction networks are derived from social media (Twitter) communication over an eventful 17-month period spanning the UK General Election in 2015 and the UK Referendum on membership of the European Union in 2016. We find that the social network structure linking MPs and MEPs evolves over time, with distinct communities forming and re-forming, driven by party affiliations and political events. Without including any information about time in our model, we nevertheless find that the evolving social network structure shows multiple persistent and recurring states of affiliation between politicians, which align with content states derived from topic analysis of tweet text. These findings show that the dominant state of partisan segregation can be challenged by major political events, ideology, and intra-party tension that transcend party affiliations.

<title>Networking Interest and Networked Structure: A Quantitative Analysis of Twitter Data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439314527054</url>
<snippet>This study examines the relationship between individuals' networking interests and a group's networked structure. The data set includes 25,651 members and 12,638 mentions from Twitter-mediated communities in South Korea. Using social network and web impact analyses, we investigated the micro- and macro linkage between individuals' interests and groups' structure, the meso-level analysis of individual-to-individual relationships, and the hyperlinked content shared in each community. Findings suggest that different interests of individuals in joining online communities were associated with variations in those communities' network structures: Communities with sociopolitical goals had a denser network structure and communities for interpersonal interests had a more reciprocated network. Communities for information access exhibited greater dependence on a single member, contrary to the communities for information sharing. Types of content shared in the communities also varied by interests. These findings led us to compose a network topology with visual representation, based on sociopolitical, informational, and interpersonal interests.

<title>The anatomy of urban social networks and its implications in the searchability problem</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep10265</url>
<snippet>The appearance of large geolocated communication datasets has recently increased our understanding of how social networks relate to their physical space. However, many recurrently reported properties, such as the spatial clustering of network communities, have not yet been systematically tested at different scales. In this work we analyze the social network structure of over 25 million phone users from three countries at three different scales: country, provinces and cities. We consistently find that this last urban scenario presents significant differences to common knowledge about social networks. First, the emergence of a giant component in the network seems to be controlled by whether or not the network spans over the entire urban border, almost independently of the population or geographic extension of the city. Second, urban communities are much less geographically clustered than expected. These two findings shed new light on the widely-studied searchability in self-organized networks. By exhaustive simulation of decentralized search strategies we conclude that urban networks are searchable not through geographical proximity as their country-wide counterparts, but through an homophily-driven community structure.

<title>Co-evolution of a socio-cognitive scientific network: A case study of citation dynamics among astronomers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.11.008</url>
<snippet>This paper aims to understand how a group of academics cite each others' work through time, considering the simultaneous co-evolution of three networks representing their scientific collaboration, the journals in which they publish and institutional membership. It argues that both social and cognitive processes contribute to these dynamics. Two types of network mechanisms are considered specifically: closures by affiliation and closures by association. To assess whether these mechanisms generate the macro features of the network under study, we propose new features for three-mode multilevel networks such as the mixed geodesic distances, mixed degree distributions, and the mixed quadrilateral census. We investigate whether a micro-level model that considers the above-mentioned network mechanisms is able to correctly reproduce these features. We apply stochastic actororiented models (SAOMs) for one-mode and two-mode networks to link the micro-macro processes using a dataset of a scientific community of astronomers from 2013 to 2015. The results suggest that social relationships grounded on scientific collaboration and proximity based on institutional affiliation are more accurately suited to understanding the co-evolution of the network of citations than an alternative approach that merely considers cognitive-based networks measured as the similarity in publishing in the same journals.

<title>Introduction to stochastic actor-based models for network dynamics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2009.02.004</url>
<snippet>Stochastic actor-based models are models for network dynamics that can represent a wide variety of influences on network change, and allow to estimate parameters expressing such influences, and test corresponding hypotheses. The nodes in the network represent social actors, and the collection of ties represents a social relation. The assumptions posit that the network evolves as a stochastic process 'driven by the actors', i.e., the model lends itself especially for representing theories about how actors change their outgoing ties. The probabilities of tie changes are in part endogenously determined, i.e., as a function of the current network structure itself, and in part exogenously, as a function of characteristics of the nodes ('actor covariates') and of characteristics of pairs of nodes ('dyadic covariates'). In an extended form, stochastic actor-based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors: dynamics of networks and behavior. This paper gives an introduction to stochastic actor-based models for dynamics of directed networks, using only a minimum of mathematics. The focus is on understanding the basic principles of the model, understanding the results, and on sensible rules for Model selection. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

<title>Inferring social network structure in ecological systems from spatio-temporal data streams</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2012.0223</url>
<snippet>We propose a methodology for extracting social network structure from spatio-temporal datasets that describe timestamped occurrences of individuals. Our approach identifies temporal regions of dense agent activity and links are drawn between individuals based on their co-occurrences across these 'gathering events'. The statistical significance of these connections is then tested against an appropriate null model. Such a framework allows us to exploit the wealth of analytical and computational tools of network analysis in settings where the underlying connectivity pattern between interacting agents (commonly termed the adjacency matrix) is not given a priori. We perform experiments on two large-scale datasets (greater than 10(6) points) of great tit Parus major wild bird foraging records and illustrate the use of this approach by examining the temporal dynamics of pairing behaviour, a process that was previously very hard to observe. We show that established pair bonds are maintained continuously, whereas new pair bonds form at variable times before breeding, but are characterized by a rapid development of network proximity. The method proposed here is general, and can be applied to any system with information about the temporal co-occurrence of interacting agents.

<title>Networks, Brokerage, and State-Led Technology Diffusion in Small Industry</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/690454</url>
<snippet>The concept of embedded autonomy speaks to the importance of coordination and bidirectional information exchange between Weberian bureaucrats and their private sector interlocutors. It has proven influential in the sociology of development, where it originated, and in the broader discipline. But the prospects for bidirectional information exchange depend upon the structure and nature of the private sector, which has been all but overlooked by the literature on embedded autonomy. This article therefore encourages scholars to take private sector structure seriously by bringing existing network analytic methods to bear on the embedded autonomy debate. Specifically, I identify a tension between the requisites of information gathering, which is facilitated by nonredundant ties among actors, and information diffusion, which requires redundant ties; demonstrate how one Mexican agency has resolved this tension in assisting the upgrading of the artisanal ceramics sector; and conclude that the strategic filling of social network holes lies at the heart of effective bureacrats' efforts to promote development.

<title>Active, aggressive, but to little avail: characterizing bot activity during the 2020 Singaporean elections</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-021-09332-1</url>
<snippet>Digital disinformation presents a challenging problem for democracies worldwide, especially in times of crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. In countries like Singapore, legislative efforts to quell fake news constitute relatively new and understudied contexts for understanding local information operations. This paper presents a social cybersecurity analysis of the 2020 Singaporean elections, which took place at the height of the pandemic and after the recent passage of an anti-fake news law. Harnessing a dataset of 240,000 tweets about the elections, we found that 26.99&#37; of participating accounts were likely to be bots, responsible for a larger proportion of bot tweets than the election in 2015. Textual analysis further showed that the detected bots used simpler and more abusive second-person language, as well as hashtags related to COVID-19 and voter activity-pointing to aggressive tactics potentially fuelling online hostility and questioning the legitimacy of the polls. Finally, bots were associated with larger, less dense, and less echo chamber-like communities, suggesting efforts to participate in larger, mainstream conversations. However, despite their distinct narrative and network maneuvers, bots generally did not hold significant influence throughout the social network. Hence, although intersecting concerns of political conflict during a global pandemic may promptly raise the possibility of online interference, we quantify both the efforts and limits of bot-fueled disinformation in the 2020 Singaporean elections. We conclude with several implications for digital disinformation in times of crisis, in the Asia-Pacific and beyond.

<title>Pandemic simulation of antivirals plus school closures: buying time until strain-specific vaccine is available</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-008-9027-1</url>
<snippet>A strain-specific vaccine is unlikely to be available in the early phases of a potential H5N1 avian influenza pandemic. It could be months and at the current production rate may not provide timely protection to the population. Intervention strategies that control the spread of infection will be necessary in this situation, such as the use of the US stockpile of antiviral medication coupled with a 6-month school closure. The agent-based simulation model, EpiSimS, was used to assess the impact of this intervention strategy followed by three different vaccine approaches: (1) 2-dose, 80&#37; effective, (2) 1-dose, 30&#37; effective, and (3) 1 dose, 80&#37; effective. Simulations show that the combination of antivirals, school closures, and a strain-specific vaccine can reduce morbidity and mortality while in effect. A significant second infection wave can occur with current vaccine technology once school closures are relaxed, though an ideal vaccine is able to contain it. In our simulations, worker absenteeism increases in all cases mostly attributed to household adults staying home with children due to the school closures.

<title>Agents of Discord: Modeling the Impact of Political Bots on Opinion Polarization in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393241270382</url>
<snippet>The pervasive presence and influence of political bots have become the subject of extensive research in recent years. Studies have revealed that a significant percentage of active accounts are bots, contributing to the polarization of public sentiment online. This study employs an agent-based model in conducting computer simulations of complex social networks, to elucidate how bots, representing diverse ideological perspectives, exacerbate societal divisions. To investigate the dynamics of opinion diffusion and shed light on the phenomenon of polarization caused by the activities of political bots, we introduced bots into a bounded-confidence opinion dynamic model for different social networks, whereby the effects of bots on other agents were studied to provide a comprehensive understanding of their influence on opinion dynamics. The simulations showed that the symmetrical deployment of bots on both sides of the opinion spectrum intensifies polarization. These effects were observed within specific tolerance and homophily ranges, with low and high user tolerances slowing down polarization. Moreover, the average path length of the network and the centrality of the bots had a significant impact on the result. Finally, polarization tends to be lower when humans exhibit reduced confidence in bots. This research not only offers valuable insights into the implications of bot activities on the polarization of public opinion and current state of digital society but also provides suggestions to mitigate bot-driven polarization.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2015.02.001</url>
<snippet>On the Internet, the line between news and opinion becomes blurred in terms of content and form. In this sense, the processes of news diffusion on the Internet and online public opinion formation are integrated. This study selects one Korean example about the private tweet of a judge about government social network service (SNS) regulation and analyzes citation networks from one news/opinion to another news/opinion. By relying on social network analysis (SNA) methods, this study examines how news/opinions diffuse and how they interact and influence each other's ideological frame within agencies sharing the same ideology and between agencies whose ideologies contrast. The results show that public discourse on the Internet is clearly polarized and fragmented along political ideological lines. Additionally, the findings show that the winner is the conservative bloc because it succeeds in achieving within-bloc solidarity and ensures the resonance of news frames with the cultural values of Korean society. Implications for these findings in modern democracy are also discussed. (C) 2015 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<title>A prospective examination of online social network dynamics and smoking cessation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183655</url>
<snippet>Introduction Use of online social networks for smoking cessation has been associated with abstinence. Little is known about the mechanisms through which the formation of social ties in an online network may influence smoking behavior. Using dynamic social network analysis, we investigated how temporal changes of an individual's number of social network ties are prospectively related to abstinence in an online social network for cessation. In a network where quitting is normative and is the focus of communications among members, we predicted that an increasing number of ties would be positively associated with abstinence. Method Participants were N = 2,657 adult smokers recruited to a randomized cessation treatment trial following enrollment on BecomeAnEX. org, a longstanding Internet cessation program with a large and mature online social network. At 3-months post-randomization, 30-day point prevalence abstinence was assessed and website engagement metrics were extracted. The social network was constructed with clickstream data to capture the flow of information among members. Two network centrality metrics were calculated at weekly intervals over 3 months: 1) indegree, defined as the number of members whose posts a participant read; and 2) out-degreeaware, defined as the number of members who read a participant's post and commented, which was subsequently viewed by the participant. Three groups of users were identified based on social network engagement patterns: non-users (N = 1,362), passive users (N = 812), and active users (N = 483). Logistic regression modeled 3-month abstinence by group as a function of baseline variables, website utilization, and network centrality metrics. Results Abstinence rates varied by group (non-users = 7.7&#37;, passive users = 10.7&#37;, active users = 20.7&#37;). Significant baseline predictors of abstinence were age, nicotine dependence, confidence to quit, and smoking temptations in social situations among passive users (ps &lt; .05); age and confidence to quit among active users. Among centrality metrics, positive associations with abstinence were observed for in-degree increases from Week 2 to Week 12 among passive and active users, and for out-degree-aware increases from Week 2 to Week 12 among active users (ps &lt; .05). Conclusions This study is the first to demonstrate that increased tie formation among members of an online social network for smoking cessation is prospectively associated with abstinence. It also highlights the value of using individuals' activities in online social networks to predict their offline health behaviors.

<title>Social Capital Across the Life Course: Age and Gendered Patterns of Network Resources</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1573-7861.2010.01179.x</url>
<snippet>Despite increasing research interest in network dynamics and cumulative advantage/disadvantage processes, little remains known about how social capital varies across the life course. While some researchers suggest that social capital increases with age and others argue the opposite, this study tests these contradictory assertions by analyzing multiple indicators of social capital from a nationally representative data set on working-age U.S. respondents. The findings reveal evidence of both social capital accumulation and decline. Social resources from occupational contacts tend to increase with age, but eventually level off among older respondents. Changes in voluntary memberships follow a similar pattern. However, daily social interaction is negatively associated with age. Overall, the results suggest that social capital embedded in occupational networks tends to accumulate across the career, even in the face of a general decline in sociability. The study also uncovers gender differences in these social capital trajectories that are linked to the distinct life experiences of men and women.

<title>Deepening the Consequences of Multidisciplinarity on Research: The Moderating Role of Social Capital</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11024-020-09404-7</url>
<snippet>This paper discusses the relationship between multidisciplinarity and research performance in the academic context. The paper explains how scholars' scientific performance is affected by the multidisciplinarity of the network of colleagues with whom they conduct their research. Furthermore, this paper explores the potential moderating role of academics' social capital, assuming that relational dynamics can mitigate the potential problems associated with disciplinary diversity. To build the proposed model, the paper draws on previous literature on diversity and social capital. The resulting hypotheses are tested through a quantitative study developed on the basis of a sample of scholars in the field of management. Information about multidisciplinarity and research performance was extracted from the Scopus database, while social capital variables were measured through social network analysis techniques. Econometric estimations were used to test the proposed relationships. The findings suggest that the effect of multidisciplinarity and researchers' performance can be depicted as an inverted U-shaped relationship, so an optimal intermediate level of diversity can be found. Estimations also show that relational, cognitive and structural social capital moderates this curvilinear relationship, making it possible to achieve higher research performance at higher levels of multidisciplinarity.

<title>"Choose Your Classmates, Your GPA Is at Stake!": The Association of Cross-Class Social Ties and Academic Performance</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764213479362</url>
<snippet>This article presents results from an investigation of the association between student academic performance and social ties. Based on social capital and networked learning research, we hypothesized that (a) students' social capital accumulated through their course progression is positively associated with their academic performance and (b) students with more social capital have significantly higher academic performance (operationalized as grade point average). Both hypotheses were supported by results of an empirical study that analyzed 10 years of student course enrolment records (N = 505) in a master's degree program offered through distance education at a Canadian university. These results are consistent with previous studies that looked at social networks built through student interaction in classrooms or computer-mediated communication environments. The significance of this research lies in the simplicity of the method used to establish student social networks from existing course registration records readily available through an institution's student information system. Direct implications of this research are that (a) study plans for students should consider investment in building new social ties in each course during degree programs and (b) readily available data about cross-class networks can be used in software systems supporting study planning.

<title>The geography of the Arab public sphere on Twitter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101327</url>
<snippet>To understand the interplay between geography and online social networks, this paper maps the Arab public sphere on online networks. We analyzed publicly available Twitter data of a large sample of Arab Twitter members (N = 1,500,000). We focused on the influence of two geographic factors - distance between individuals and air travel frequency - as well as the influence of the language of the followers of Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya Twitter accounts on the formation of transnational social ties among Arabs. Distance between individuals and language differences significantly predicted Arabs' social ties. Frequency of airline flights between nations and being a regional television follower strongly predicted social ties as well. From the geographical perspective, then, the findings challenge the online Arab public sphere notion as well as wider theories of space-time compression in the global era. Similarly, the analysis highlights the distinct English and Arabic realms. In contrast, the findings illustrate the important role that regional media plays in promoting an Arab public sphere. Combined, the findings elaborately portray the narrow boundaries of the Arab public sphere on Twitter and illustrates that the fragmented Arab world's offline structure is reflected on Twitter.

Misinformation content such as fake-news and hoaxes, though often considered innocuous, may have high social cost such as influencing elections decision, and thus should be investigated carefully. Many researchers have studied various aspects of fake-news including automated ways to recognize it. However, a large-scale study comparing the sharing patterns of fake-news and trusted-news is missing. In this research, we take Ukraine, a country where fake news is common, as a case study. Using datasets generated by three different Tweets collection strategies, we present an anatomical comparison of fake-news and trusted-news sharing pattern on Twitter. Such a comparison enables to identify the characteristics of tweets sharing fake-news, and allows to find the users who are more inclined to share misinformation. Besides, we also study possible bot activities in the dataset. The top conclusions derived from this study are (a) Users sharing fake-news stories are more likely to include hashtags, and the hashtags used in Tweets sharing fake-news stories are similar to hashtags used in Tweets sharing trusted news. (b) Users sharing fake-news are also more likely to include mentions, but mentions used in tweets sharing fake-news and trusted-news are often different.

<title>Structure and Functions of Online Communities: Network Mapping of HIV-relevant groups in VK.com SNS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>With the rapid growth of online social network sites (SNS), the issue of health-related online communities and its social and behavioral outcomes has become increasingly popular in Internet studies and sociology of health and medicine. This paper presents the results of empirical study investigating the structure of the 'friendship' networks and participants' communicative activity within 15 online groups on VK.com SNS. In this pilot study we seek to trace the relation between declared aims (social functions) and structure of online groups devoted to the HIV/AIDS theme. First, we propose a classification of online HIV-related groups according to their declared purposes and actual social functions. The most widespread group types on VK.com SNS are HIV activists, HIV-infected dating groups, AIDS denialists movement groups, online pages of offline organizations and social support groups. Second, we identify and describe several patterns of network structure and user behavior among these groups. We distinguish five types of community structure: tight crowd, polarized crowd, stratified structure, clustered network and disintegrated structure. Finally, we find and interpret relation between the purposes and functions, on the one hand, and network structure of online communities, on the other. Tight crowd networks mainly occur in dating groups for HIV-infected persons, and links in them are determined by users' gender (homogeneous or heterogeneous ties prevail). Stratified structure is related to HIV activists, especially to AIDS denialists movement groups. Crucial factor of network formation for this pattern is participation in public discussion within a group. Active users form a cohesive community while passive users stay isolated or connected with just a few active users. Our findings are consistent with some previous research of communication network structures on other social media platforms.

<title>Benchmarking seeding strategies for spreading processes in social networks: an interplay between influencers, topologies and sizes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-60239-4</url>
<snippet>The explosion of network science has permitted an understanding of how the structure of social networks affects the dynamics of social contagion. In community-based interventions with spill-over effects, identifying influential spreaders may be harnessed to increase the spreading efficiency of social contagion, in terms of time needed to spread all the largest connected component of the network. Several strategies have been proved to be efficient using only data and simulation-based models in specific network topologies without a consensus of an overall result. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to benchmark the spreading efficiency of seeding strategies related to network structural properties and sizes. We simulate spreading processes on empirical and simulated social networks within a wide range of densities, clustering coefficients, and sizes. We also propose three new decentralized seeding strategies that are structurally different from well-known strategies: community hubs, ambassadors, and random hubs. We observe that the efficiency ranking of strategies varies with the network structure. In general, for sparse networks with community structure, decentralized influencers are suitable for increasing the spreading efficiency. By contrast, when the networks are denser, centralized influencers outperform. These results provide a framework for selecting efficient strategies according to different contexts in which social networks emerge.

<title>Identification of Direct and Indirect Social Network Effects in the Pathophysiology of Insulin Resistance in Obese Human Subjects</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0093860</url>
<snippet>Objective: The aim of the present study was to examine to what extent different social network mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin-resistance. Design: We used nonparametric and parametric regression models to analyse whether individual BMI and HOMA-IR are determined by social network characteristics. Subjects and Methods: A total of 677 probands (EGO) and 3033 social network partners (ALTER) were included in the study. Data gathered from the probands include anthropometric measures, HOMA-IR index, health attitudes, behavioural and socio- economic variables and social network data. Results: We found significant treatment effects for ALTERs frequent dieting (p &lt; 0.001) and ALTERs health oriented nutritional attitudes (p, 0.001) on EGO's BMI, establishing a significant indirect network effect also on EGO's insulin resistance. Most importantly, we also found significant direct social network effects on EGO's insulin resistance, evidenced by an effect of ALTERs frequent dieting (p = 0.033) and ALTERs sport activities (p = 0.041) to decrease EGO's HOMA-IR index independently of EGO's BMI. Conclusions: Social network phenomena appear not only to be relevant for the spread of obesity, but also for the spread of insulin resistance as the basis for type 2 diabetes. Attitudes and behaviour of peer groups influence EGO's health status not only via social mechanisms, but also via socio- biological mechanisms, i.e. higher brain areas might be influenced not only by biological signals from the own organism, but also by behaviour and knowledge from different human individuals. Our approach allows the identification of peer group influence controlling for potential homophily even when using cross-sectional observational data.

<title>Social networking sites and low-income teenagers: between opportunity and inequality</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1139614</url>
<snippet>Recent studies on social networking sites (SNSs) reveal that users' social background is not a significant predictor of participation in this type of social media. The broad user bases of Facebook and other social media platforms also appear to suggest that social background no longer affects access to SNSs. A small number of studies even claim that in the participatory web environment, social content is more likely to be created by non-elites, such as lower-income people or racial minorities [Blank, G.(2013). Who creates content? Stratification and content creation on the Internet. Information, Communication &amp; Society, 16(4), 590-612]. Nevertheless, engagement with SNSs also reproduces inequalities, for example via class- and ethnic-based self-segregation' [boyd, d.(2012). White flight in networked publics? How race and class shaped American teen engagement with MySpace and Facebook. In L.Nakamura &amp; P.A.Chow-White (Eds.), Race after the internet (pp.203-222). NewYork, NY: Routledge]. Drawing on a large-scale survey (N=2327) and a set of 56 interviews with Italian teenagers, the current paper explores the persistent influence of socio-economic background and cultural capital in adolescents' use of SNSs. The research findings show that, although structural variables inevitably influence their participation in social media, teenagers from lower-income' families are more enthusiastic about the communication and relational features of these sites. In contrast, their peers from elite' families focus on the capital-enhancing opportunities offered by SNSs and display a critical stance that leads them to limit their social activities on these platforms. Overall, the results suggest that SNSs are not exempt from digital inequalities, but nonetheless provide novel opportunities to lower-income teenagers.

<title>Youth and social media: the affordances and challenges of online graffiti practice</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01634437211069969</url>
<snippet>The impact of social media use on youth subcultures, such as graffiti writers, has been rapid and dramatic, bringing with it a number of significant transformations that present both opportunities and challenges. This paper explores the impact of the Internet and social media on a community of graffiti practitioners. I argue that the rise and uptake of online social networking platforms such as Instagram and You Tube have offered a range of affordances to the practice of graffiti writing. These affordances include: greater accessibility to graffiti culture; learning opportunities; and opportunities for wider distribution and curation of graffiti pieces. Simultaneously, social media challenges the significance of 'community', that is, the physical social interaction afforded by participation in real world graffiti crews. The findings suggest that while there are tangible benefits from the use of the Internet and uptake of social media by the graffiti writing community, it is the physical communal bonds experienced within a graffiti crew that are vital to the wellbeing and continuity of the culture. This paper contributes to our understanding of how social media affects youth more broadly and specifically how social media platforms are transforming the experience of youth subcultural practice.

<title>Group Polarization Based on Agent Emotional Characteristics and Credibility</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/9983541</url>
<snippet>The frequent occurrence of group polarization in many internet mass incidents produces adverse impacts on the social stability and poses a significant challenge for social management. We construct an opinion evolution model with agent emotional characteristics and credibility based on the Deffuant model to study the evolutionary mechanism of group polarization, which connects the agent's firmness with the agent's opinion, taking a full account of the agent heterogeneity. We analyze the impacts of initial opinion distribution, network structure, and opinion leader on the group opinion evolution. The results show that group polarization is easier to form when the initial opinions are in a normal distribution, and group polarization will also form under the impact of initial minority agents with extreme opinions. Different network structures will pose different effects on the group opinion evolution, and group polarization is easier to form in the small-world network and BA scale-free network. In addition, opinion leader also affects the group opinion evolution, and it will hinder the generation of group polarization.

<title>Can Twitter be a Reliable Proxy to Characterize Nation-wide Human Mobility? A Case Study of Spain</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393211071071</url>
<snippet>In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the exploitation of geo-tagged documents posted on Online Social Networks (OSN) for human-mobility pattern mining. These patterns can ease the development of effective and intelligent location-based systems of different scenarios. However, the validation of OSN geo-data as a reliable source for human mobility has not been fully studied in literature. Therefore, this study proposes a comprehensive comparison of a nation-scale Twitter (TWT) dataset with an official mobility study published by the Spanish Ministry of Development. Both feeds have been compared considering different variables, such as population density and spatial granularity, among others. Results show that TWT can be a reliable source for human-mobility mining but only when certain socioeconomic, temporal, and spatial factors co-occur.

<title>The effect of excluding juveniles on apparent adult olive baboons (&lt;i&gt;Papio anubis&lt;/i&gt;) social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173146</url>
<snippet>In recent years there has been much interest in investigating the social structure of group living animals using social network analysis. Many studies so far have focused on the social networks of adults, often excluding younger, immature group members. This potentially may lead to a biased view of group social structure as multiple recent studies have shown that younger group members can significantly contribute to group structure. As proof of the concept, we address this issue by investigating social network structure with and without juveniles in wild olive baboons (Papio anubis) at Gashaka Gumti National Park, Nigeria. Two social networks including all independently moving individuals (i.e., excluding dependent juveniles) were created based on aggressive and grooming behaviour. We used knockout simulations based on the random removal of individuals from the network in order to investigate to what extent the exclusion of juveniles affects the resulting network structure and our interpretation of age-sex specific social roles. We found that juvenile social patterns differed from those of adults and that the exclusion of juveniles from the network significantly altered the resulting overall network structure. Moreover, the removal of juveniles from the network affected individuals in specific age-sex classes differently: for example, including juveniles in the grooming network increased network centrality of adult females while decreasing centrality of adult males. These results suggest that excluding juveniles from the analysis may not only result in a distorted picture of the overall social structure but also may mask some of the social roles of individuals belonging to different age-sex classes.

<title>Fractional Dynamics of Network Growth Constrained by Aging Node Interactions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0154983</url>
<snippet>In many social complex systems, in which agents are linked by non-linear interactions, the history of events strongly influences the whole network dynamics. However, a class of "commonly accepted beliefs" seems rarely studied. In this paper, we examine how the growth process of a (social) network is influenced by past circumstances. In order to tackle this cause, we simply modify the well known preferential attachment mechanism by imposing a time dependent kernel function in the network evolution equation. This approach leads to a fractional order Barabosi-Albert (BA) differential equation, generalizing the BA model. Our results show that, with passing time, an aging process is observed for the network dynamics. The aging process leads to a decay for the node degree values, thereby creating an opposing process to the preferential attachment mechanism. On one hand, based on the preferential attachment mechanism, nodes with a high degree are more likely to absorb links; but, on the other hand, a node's age has a reduced chance for new connections. This competitive scenario allows an increased chance for younger members to become a hub. Simulations of such a network growth with aging constraint confirm the results found from solving the fractional BA equation. We also report, as an exemplary application, an investigation of the collaboration network between Hollywood movie actors. It is undubiously shown that a decay in the dynamics of their collaboration rate is found, even including a sex difference. Such findings suggest a widely universal application of the so generalized BA model.

<title>Clustered marginalization of minorities during social transitions induced by co-evolution of behaviour and network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep30790</url>
<snippet>Large-scale transitions in societies are associated with both individual behavioural change and restructuring of the social network. These two factors have often been considered independently, yet recent advances in social network research challenge this view. Here we show that common features of societal marginalization and clustering emerge naturally during transitions in a co-evolutionary adaptive network model. This is achieved by explicitly considering the interplay between individual interaction and a dynamic network structure in behavioural selection. We exemplify this mechanism by simulating how smoking behaviour and the network structure get reconfigured by changing social norms. Our results are consistent with empirical findings: The prevalence of smoking was reduced, remaining smokers were preferentially connected among each other and formed increasingly marginalized clusters. We propose that self-amplifying feedbacks between individual behaviour and dynamic restructuring of the network are main drivers of the transition. This generative mechanism for co-evolution of individual behaviour and social network structure may apply to a wide range of examples beyond smoking.

<title>Media literacy and partisan convergence across social network sites</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03623319.2022.2127174</url>
<snippet>The existing literature highlights social network sites (SNS) as important channels for consuming news and receiving misinformation. However, people surf multiple SNS daily, such as Facebook, Twitter, Line, etc. People also connect and interact with each other, given the characteristics of specific SNS. Driven by partisan bias, partisan supporters may be driven to converge on a specific SNS due to a political echo chamber that exists there. In such a partisan convergence scenario, politicized SNS usage may lead to bias to color the spread of fact-checking and, therefore, politically bias SNS users' level of media literacy. We examine this hypothesis in a pre-registered national survey (n = 1060) in the 2020 Taiwan Presidential Election. Results show that (1), in general, the usage of the private messaging app Line is related to a lower level of media literacy. The effect holds across political and non-political misinformation items. (2) DPP supporters are much more likely to use Facebook than other supporters, while their political opponents are alienated from Facebook. Therefore, (3) Facebook usage is related to a higher media literacy discerning DPP-related fake news but not others, and the effect exists beyond DPP supporters.

<title>A Community Perspective on Resilience Analytics: A Visual Analysis of Community Mood</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/risa.12788</url>
<snippet>Social networks are ubiquitous in everyday life. Although commonly analyzed from a perspective of individual interactions, social networks can provide insights about the collective behavior of a community. It has been shown that changes in the mood of social networks can be correlated to economic trends, public demonstrations, and political reactions, among others. In this work, we study community resilience in terms of the mood variations of the community. We have developed a method to characterize the mood steady-state of online social networks and to analyze how this steady-state is affected under certain perturbations or events that affect a community. We applied this method to study community behavior for three real social network situations, with promising results.

<title>Network Structure Matters: Unpacking Associations Among Informational WeChat Use, Network Heterogeneity, Network Capital, and Civic Involvement</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440241253051</url>
<snippet>Although mobile social networking sites have successfully penetrated into individual's various aspects of everyday lives, few empirical studies have investigated important antecedents of civic involvement in the WeChat context from a network capital perspective. The principal aims of the research are to systematically explore the underlying associations between mobile social media use, network heterogeneity, network capital, and civic participation among young people. The data was collected in an online survey of 1,208 young people in mainland China. Structural equation modeling analysis was carried out to examine the corresponding hypotheses. Findings revealed that informational WeChat use could positively impact young people's network heterogeneity, which subsequently contributes to increased degrees of civic involvement. Additionally, the results demonstrated that network heterogeneity and network capital on WeChat are positively associated with civic involvement. Furthermore, network heterogeneity and network capital could mediate the association between WeChat use for information and individual's civic activities. These obtained outcomes underlined the vital role of mobile social media communication in facilitating democratic engagement of young citizens in contemporary mobile media-saturated society.

<title>Small world dynamics and the process of knowledge diffusion: The case of the metropolitan area of Greater Santiago de Chile</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>This paper aims to understand some of the mechanisms which dominate the phenomenon of knowledge diffusion in the process that is called 'interactive learning'. We examine how knowledge spreads in a network in which agents have 'face-to-face' learning interactions. We define a social network structured as a graph consisting of agents (vertices) and connections (edges) and situated on a grid which resembles the geographical characteristics of the metropolitan area of Greater Santiago de Chile. The target of this simulation is to test whether knowledge diffuses homogeneously or whether it follows some biased path generating geographical divergence between a core area and a periphery. We also investigate the efficiency of our 'preference' model of agent decision-making and show that this system evolves towards a small-world type network.

<title>Emergence of consensus as a modular-to-nested transition in communication dynamics</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep41673</url>
<snippet>Online social networks have transformed the way in which humans communicate and interact, leading to a new information ecosystem where people send and receive information through multiple channels, including traditional communication media. Despite many attempts to characterize the structure and dynamics of these techno-social systems, little is known about fundamental aspects such as how collective attention arises and what determines the information life-cycle. Current approaches to these problems either focus on human temporal dynamics or on semiotic dynamics. In addition, as recently shown, information ecosystems are highly competitive, with humans and memes striving for scarce resources-visibility and attention, respectively. Inspired by similar problems in ecology, here we develop a methodology that allows to cast all the previous aspects into a compact framework and to characterize, using microblogging data, information-driven systems as mutualistic networks. Our results show that collective attention around a topic is reached when the user-meme network self-adapts from a modular to a nested structure, which ultimately allows minimizing competition and attaining consensus. Beyond a sociological interpretation, we explore such resemblance to natural mutualistic communities via well-known dynamics of ecological systems.

<title>POLITICAL EFFECTS OF SOCIAL NETWORKS IN RUSSIA</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/S013216250004012-6</url>
<snippet>Analysis of the political aspects of the development of Internet social networks is a promising field in political sociology. The cyberspace of the network performs not only a social and communicative function, but also possesses significant political potential. Online social networks have become a phenomenon of social and political life in modern Russia and influence its dynamics and character, acting as a legitimising power mechanism. Integration of public policy into virtual social space causes formation of network forms of political participation for citizens and their new online identities. At the same time, the specifics of online political interactions limit the opportunities for social dialogue, which is already difficult in Russia due to the existence of clearly expressed ideological and value differences in society. The social Internet space serves as a virtual projection of social contradictions and acts as an arena for the clash of political interests. Social networks, although declaring the principles of solidarity, self-organization and collective identity, are in fact stratified, do not imply equality of users, nor do they provide a balance of their interests. Networks provide a wide range of opportunities for political manipulation and influence curation of public consciousness. In Russia, political power uses a number of tools to implement administrative control over the digital social space, which makes one question viability of the network society project as a modern policy-management alternative. Nevertheless, it is hoped that as the network involvement of Russian citizens increases, the political potential of the virtual communication space will increase, too.

<title>Leadership in informal stormwater governance networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222434</url>
<snippet>Recent transitions in the governance of urban stormwater, specifically developments that leverage the environmental and social benefits of green infrastructure (GI) including infiltration and neighborhood stabilization, often require capacities beyond those of any single municipal- or regional-scale organization. In many cities, transitions toward green storm water infrastructure have been shepherded by networks of individuals spanning a diversity of organizations from governments to NGOs. These networks are often informal, that is, not established by legal mandate, governing authority, or formal agreement, and are often striking for their lack of formal hierarchy or formal leadership. Previous scholarship has revealed the importance of leadership in the development and efficacy of these multiorganizational, cross-sector environmental governance networks, but research has yet to empirically investigate and characterize informal network leaders within the context of GI for stormwater mitigation. To address this gap, we designed and administered a social network analysis (SNA) survey to individuals in a regional network of GI stormwater management professionals in and around Cleveland, Ohio USA. We collected network data on individual relationships, including collaboration and trust, and tested the impact of these relationships on peer-recognition of leaders in the GI network. Our findings suggest that network size, frequency of collaboration, and individual position within the network specifically, betweenness centrality and openness defined and likely supported leaders in the stormwater governance network. Leaders in this non-hierarchical, multi-institution context were more likely to be women and brokerage roles within the network benefitted women, not men, which contrasts with previous findings from research on single-organization and corporate networks. The implications of this research suggest that informal environmental governance networks, such as the GI network investigated, differ substantially from the generally more hierarchical networks of organizations. This finding is useful for municipalities and regional authorities grappling with complex environmental challenges, including transitions in strategies to manage excess stormwater for the protection of municipal drinking water sources and urban freshwater ecosystems.

<title>'Enclaves of exposure': A conceptual viewpoint to explore cross-ideology exposure on social network sites</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2018.08.015</url>
<snippet>Previous studies indicate mixed results as to whether social media constitutes ideological echo chambers. This inconsistency may arise due to a lack of theoretical frames that acknowledge the fact that contextual and technological factors allow varying levels of cross-cutting exposure on social media. This study suggests an alternative theoretical lens, divergence of exposure - co-existence of user groups with varying degrees of cross-ideology exposure related to the same issue - as a notion that serves as an overarching perspective. We suggest that mediated spaces, such as social media groups, can serve as enclaves of exposure that offer affordances for formation of user groups irrespective of offline social distinctions. Yet social elements cause some of them to display more cross-ideology exchange than others. To establish this claim empirically, we examine two Facebook page user networks ( 'Sri Lanka's Killing Fields' and 'Sri Lankans Hate Channel 4') that emerged in response to Sri Lanka's Killing Fields, a controversial documentary broadcast by Channel 4 that accused Sri Lankan armed forces of human rights violation during the final stage of the separatist conflict in Sri Lanka. The results showed that the Facebook group network that supported the claims made by Channel 4 is more diverse in terms of ethnic composition, and is neither assortative nor disassortative across ethnicity, suggesting the presence of cross-ethnicity interaction. The pro-allegiant group was largely homogenous and less active, resembling a passive echo chamber. 'Social mediation' repurposes enclaves of exposure to represent polarized ideologies where some venues display cross-ideology exposure, while others resemble an 'echo chamber'.

<title>Causal language and strength of inference in academic and media articles shared in social media (CLAIMS): A systematic review</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196346</url>
<snippet>Background The pathway from evidence generation to consumption contains many steps which can lead to overstatement or misinformation. The proliferation of internet-based health news may encourage selection of media and academic research articles that overstate strength of causal inference. We investigated the state of causal inference in health research as it appears at the end of the pathway, at the point of social media consumption. Methods We screened the NewsWhip Insights database for the most shared media articles on Facebook and Twitter reporting about peer-reviewed academic studies associating an exposure with a health outcome in 2015, extracting the 50 most-shared academic articles and media articles covering them. We designed and utilized a review tool to systematically assess and summarize studies' strength of causal inference, including generalizability, potential confounders, and methods used. These were then compared with the strength of causal language used to describe results in both academic and media articles. Two randomly assigned independent reviewers and one arbitrating reviewer from a pool of 21 reviewers assessed each article. Results We accepted the most shared 64 media articles pertaining to 50 academic articles for review, representing 68&#37; of Facebook and 45&#37; of Twitter shares in 2015. Thirty-four percent of academic studies and 48&#37; of media articles used language that reviewers considered too strong for their strength of causal inference. Seventy percent of academic studies were considered low or very low strength of inference, with only 6&#37; considered high or very high strength of causal inference. The most severe issues with academic studies' causal inference were reported to be omitted confounding variables and generalizability. Fifty-eight percent of media articles were found to have inaccurately reported the question, results, intervention, or population of the academic study. Conclusions We find a large disparity between the strength of language as presented to the research consumer and the underlying strength of causal inference among the studies most widely shared on social media. However, because this sample was designed to be representative of the articles selected and shared on social media, it is unlikely to be representative of all academic and media work. More research is needed to determine how academic institutions, media organizations, and social network sharing patterns impact causal inference and language as received by the research consumer.

<title>Gender, body size and social relations in American high schools</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>To investigate the role of body size in social networks, this study estimated cross-nested multilevel network models (p) with longitudinal data from the 16 saturated schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. As body mass index increased, the likelihood of being nominated by schoolmates as friends - but not the likelihood of nominating others as friends decreased. This trend was more pronounced among girls. Moreover, similarity in body mass index strongly predicted friendship formation. These findings were not explained by correlates (e.g., academic achievement) of both body size and friendship dynamics. Thus, the connection between body size and high school social relations was largely a function of the stigmatization of heavier body sizes, especially for girls, and of homophily.

<title>Social Network Research contribution to evaluating process in a feasibility study of a peer-led and school-based sexual health intervention</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90852-w</url>
<snippet>There is growing interest in social network-based programmes to improve health, but rigorous methods using Social Network research to evaluate the process of these interventions is less well developed. Using data from the "STis And Sexual Health" (STASH) feasibility trial of a school-based, peer-led intervention on sexual health prevention, we illustrate how network data analysis results can address key components of process evaluations for complex interventions-implementation, mechanisms of impacts, and context. STASH trained students as Peer Supporters (PS) to diffuse sexual health messages though face-to-face interactions and online Facebook (FB) groups. We applied a Multilevel Exponential Random Graph modelling approach to analyse the interdependence between offline friendship relationships and online FB ties and how these different relationships align. Our results suggest that the creation of online FB communities mirrored offline adolescent groups, demonstrating fidelity of intervention delivery. Data on informal friendship networks related to student's individual characteristics (i.e., demographics, sexual health knowledge and adherence to norms, which were included for STASH), contributed to an understanding of the social relational 'building' mechanisms that sustain tie-formation. This knowledge could assist the selection of opinion leaders, improving identification of influential peers situated in optimal network positions. This work provides a novel contribution to understanding how to integrate network research with the process evaluation of a network intervention.

<title>The Evolution Will Not Be Broadcast (or Published): Social Capital, Assimilation, and the Changing Queer Community</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2018.1511132</url>
<snippet>Widespread technological advances, coupled with social and political success by the LGBTQ rights movement in the decades following the Stonewall uprising in 1969, have resulted in a dramatic evolution in the queer community. But increases in visibility, acceptance, and assimilation of queers into mainstream culture and cultural institutions have been accompanied by mainstream gentrification of formerly queer neighborhoods, more specialized social alternatives to bars and bookstores, and diminished interest in and audiences for niche-appeal media. At the same time, other institutions in the LGBTQ community, including the queer civic and fraternal organization The Court, the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network (GLSEN), social media platforms such as Grindr, and online journalism cites such as Towleroad have become destination sites for many in cyberspace. In this article, I argue that social network theory (SNT) offers efficacy in both explaining and predicting institutional success in the evolving queer community and that queers, regardless of age, location, and relationship status, will affiliate with institutions that offer them to potential for the accumulation of social capital.

<title>Link prediction in complex network using information flow</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-41476-9</url>
<snippet>Link prediction in complex networks has recently attracted a great deal of attraction in diverse scientific domains, including social and biological sciences. Given a snapshot of a network, the goal is to predict links that are missing in the network or that are likely to occur in the near future. This problem has both theoretical and practical significance; it not only helps us to identify missing links in a network more efficiently by avoiding the expensive and time consuming experimental processes, but also allows us to study the evolution of a network with time. To address the problem of link prediction, numerous attempts have been made over the recent years that exploit the local and the global topological properties of the network to predict missing links in the network. In this paper, we use parametrised matrix forest index (PMFI) to predict missing links in a network. We show that, for small parameter values, this index is linked to a heat diffusion process on a graph and therefore encodes geometric properties of the network. We then develop a framework that combines the PMFI with a local similarity index to predict missing links in the network. The framework is applied to numerous networks obtained from diverse domains such as social network, biological network, and transport network. The results show that the proposed method can predict missing links with higher accuracy when compared to other state-of-the-art link prediction methods.

<title>Towards quantifying the communication aspect of resilience in disaster-prone communities</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-59192-3</url>
<snippet>In this study, we investigate the communication networks of urban, suburban, and rural communities from three US Midwest counties through a stochastic model that simulates the diffusion of information over time in disaster and in normal situations. To understand information diffusion in communities, we investigate the interplay of information that individuals get from online social networks, local news, government sources, mainstream media, and print media. We utilize survey data collected from target communities and create graphs of each community to quantify node-to-node and source-to-node interactions, as well as trust patterns. Monte Carlo simulation results show the average time it takes for information to propagate to 90&#37; of the population for each community. We conclude that rural, suburban, and urban communities have different inherent properties promoting the varied flow of information. Also, information sources affect information spread differently, causing degradation of information speed if any source becomes unavailable. Finally, we provide insights on the optimal investments to improve disaster communication based on community features and contexts.

<title>Fake news propagates differently from real news even at early stages of spreading</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-020-00224-z</url>
<snippet>Social media can be a double-edged sword for society, either as a convenient channel exchanging ideas or as an unexpected conduit circulating fake news through a large population. While existing studies of fake news focus on theoretical modeling of propagation or identification methods based on machine learning, it is important to understand the realistic propagation mechanisms between theoretical models and black-box methods. Here we track large databases of fake news and real news in both, Weibo in China and Twitter in Japan from different cultures, which include their traces of re-postings. We find in both online social networks that fake news spreads distinctively from real news even at early stages of propagation, e.g. five hours after the first re-postings. Our finding demonstrates collective structural signals that help to understand the different propagation evolution of fake news and real news. Different from earlier studies, identifying the topological properties of the information propagation at early stages may offer novel features for early detection of fake news in social media.

<title>Neither influence nor selection: Examining co-evolution of political orientation and social networks in the NetSense and NetHealth studies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233458</url>
<snippet>Political orientation is one of the most important and consequential individual attributes studied by social scientists. Yet, we know relatively little about the temporal evolution of political orientation, especially at periods in the life course during which individuals are forming new social relationships and transitioning to new relational contexts. Here we use Stochastic Actor-Oriented models (SAOMs) to examine the co-evolution of political orientation and social networks using two feature-rich, temporal network datasets from samples of students making the transition to college at the University of Notre Dame (i.e. the NetSense and NetHealth studies). Overall, we find a great deal of stability in political orientation, with a slight tendency for the 2011 NetSense study participants to become more conservative during their first four semesters in college, but not the 2015 NetHealth study participants. Partisanship is the best predictor of changes in political orientation, with students who identify or vote as Republicans becoming more conservative over time. Neither network influence nor selection processes seem to be driving observed changes. During this formative period, relatively stable identities such as party affiliation predict changes in political orientation independently of local network dynamics, selection processes, socio-demographic traits, and dispositional factors.

<title>Inferring population-level contact heterogeneity from common epidemic data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2012.0578</url>
<snippet>Models of infectious disease spread that incorporate contact heterogeneity through contact networks are an important tool for epidemiologists studying disease dynamics and assessing intervention strategies. One of the challenges of contact network epidemiology has been the difficulty of collecting individual and population-level data needed to develop an accurate representation of the underlying host population's contact structure. In this study, we evaluate the utility of common epidemiological measures (R-0, epidemic peak size, duration and final size) for inferring the degree of heterogeneity in a population's unobserved contact structure through a Bayesian approach. We test the method using ground truth data and find that some of these epidemiological metrics are effective at classifying contact heterogeneity. The classification is also consistent across pathogen transmission probabilities, and so can be applied even when this characteristic is unknown. In particular, the reproductive number, R-0, turns out to be a poor classifier of the degree heterogeneity, while, unexpectedly, final epidemic size is a powerful predictor of network structure across the range of heterogeneity. We also evaluate our framework on empirical epidemiological data from past and recent outbreaks to demonstrate its application in practice and to gather insights about the relevance of particular contact structures for both specific systems and general classes of infectious disease. We thus introduce a simple approach that can shed light on the unobserved connectivity of a host population given epidemic data. Our study has the potential to inform future data-collection efforts and study design by driving our understanding of germane epidemic measures, and highlights a general inferential approach to learning about host contact structure in contemporary or historic populations of humans and animals.

<title>Do social ties foster firms' environmental innovation? The moderating effect of resource bricolage</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2020.1821876</url>
<snippet>While social ties are central to the field of innovation, the research on the relationship between social ties and environmental innovation is lacking. Based on the resource-based view and social network theory, we construct a research model for identifying the relationships between social ties, resource bricolage, and environmental innovation; we use this to examine the impacts of business, political, and research and development (R&amp;D) ties on firms' levels of radical and incremental eco-innovation, as well as the moderating role of resource bricolage. Multiple regression analysis using survey data from 289 Chinese manufacturing firms is conducted. The results show that political and R&amp;D ties can effectively promote radical eco-innovation, while business and political ties promote incremental eco-innovation. Furthermore, resource bricolage plays a positive moderating role in the relationships between firms' political ties and environmental innovation. These conclusions have certain implications for firms, offering useful insight on how to take full advantage of social ties to acquire various resources and harness resource bricolage strategies to support environmental innovation.

<title>The gendered semiotics of far-right populism on Instagram: A case from Spain</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09579265221100486</url>
<snippet>Perhaps more than any other online social-networking platform, Instagram facilitates the construction and management of public image, serving as a potentially effective tool for political actors; nevertheless, it remains relatively understudied among digital communication strategies. In this article, I investigate the platform's use by far-right populist politicians, turning to Santiago Abascal of Spain as a case study. Performing detailed analysis on a corpus of Abascal's most popular posts determined by their "engagement rate," I expose the gendered mode of self-presentation that resonates with Abascal's public. In the second part of the article, I consider an equivalent corpus from President Pedro Sanchez, one of Abascal's main political rivals at the time of writing. This comparative juxtaposition illustrates stark differences in approaches to social media and underscores how effective particular performances of masculinity can be for populist politicians. Ultimately, I aim to shed insight on the specific ways that Instagram serves far-right political projects, both in Spain and beyond.

<title>Perceived group cohesion versus actual social structure: A study using social network analysis of egocentric Facebook networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2018.04.004</url>
<snippet>Research on group cohesion often relies on individual perceptions, which may not reflect the actual social structure of groups. This study draws on social network theory to examine the relationship between observable structural group characteristics and individual perceptions of group cohesion. Leveraging Facebook data, we extracted and partitioned the social networks of 109 participants into groups using a modularity algorithm. We then surveyed perceptions of cohesion, and computed group density and size using social network analysis. Out of six linear mixed effects models specified, a random intercept and fixed slope model with group size as a predictor of perceived group cohesion emerged as best fitting. Whereas group density was not linked to perceived cohesion, size had a small negative effect on perceived cohesion, suggesting that people perceive smaller groups as more cohesive. We discuss the potential of social network analysis, visualization tools, and Facebook data for advancing research on groups.

<title>What drives participatory policy processes: Grassroot activities, scientific knowledge or donor money? - A comparative policy network approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.03.001</url>
<snippet>A policy network approach has been developed to assess participatory policy processes in Ghana, Senegal, and Uganda. Theoretically, political influence measures correspond to two different influence mechanisms: vote buying and informational lobbying. For each mechanism, separate measures were defined and empirically derived from corresponding policy networks. Exponential random graph models were used to assess the network generating process, which allows for analysis of the robustness of the derived influence measures and the determinants of network structure. The results imply that participatory policy processes are dominated by donor and research organizations, while farm interests and civil society organizations have only a negligible influence. The design of stakeholder systems appears to be difficult since the observed network structures are mainly determined by relational factors that result from organizations' social networking activities or other organizational attributes, such as reputation power, which cannot be easily controlled. Institutional factors such as membership in committees have only a minor impact.

<snippet>This study investigates mechanisms of tie formation in an interorganizational network generated by the mobility of employees between organizations. We analyze a data set that contains information on all organizations in the Stockholm metropolitan area between 1990 and 2003. We show that the formation of new ties is contingent upon the direction of past ties, and that most connections occur at an intermediate geodesic distance of 2 and 3. The findings highlight the importance of tie direction and indirect connections in research on network dynamics and knowledge exchanges stemming from the mobility of employees across organizations.

<title>Social network structure and the trade-off between social utility and economic performance</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.05.002</url>
<snippet>We put forward a computational multi-agent model capturing the impact of social network structure on individuals' social trust, willingness to cooperate, social utility and economic performance. Social network structure is modeled as four distinct social capital dimensions: degree, centrality, bridging and bonding social capital. Model setup draws from socio-economic theory and empirical findings based on our novel survey dataset. Results include aggregate-level comparative statics and individual-level correlations. We find, inter alia, that societies that either are better connected, exhibit a lower frequency of local cliques, or have a smaller share of family-based cliques, record relatively better aggregate economic performance. As long as family ties are sufficiently valuable, there is a trade-off between aggregate social utility and economic performance, and small world networks are then socially optimal. We also find that in dense networks and trustful societies, there is a trade-off between individual social utility and economic performance; otherwise both outcomes are positively correlated in the cross section.

<title>Recruitment through Rule Breaking: Establishing Social Ties with Gang Members</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cico.12272</url>
<snippet>Many contemporary violence prevention programs direct concentrated law enforcement, social service, or educational attention toward individuals engaged in violence, and yet, this population is often avoiding this precise attention. Drawing on 18 months of ethnographic data, this case study asks: How do street outreach workers form social ties with active gang members? This study identifies three key mechanisms of social tie formation that break organizational rules, but account for how new social relations are formed with street savvy gang youth: (1) Network Targeting: identifying, entering, and extending services to the package of preexisting social ties beyond the eligible gang member; (2) Gift Giving: navigating those social ties when transferring out of pocket gifts to the target to elicit trust and demonstrate genuine investment; and (3) Transportation Brokerage: expanding clients' social networks by literally driving them to prosocial influences and activities. Discussion of the value and limitations of each mechanism offers insights to urban sociologists interested in the origins of social ties in disadvantaged communities, as well as policymakers designing social interventions for hard to reach populations.

<title>"Gateway Conspiracy": Distrust of the COVID-19 Pandemic as a Gateway to Conspiracy Theories</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.5477/cis/reis.188</url>
<snippet>The article examines how distrust regarding the COVID-19 pandemic has served as a catalyst for the diffusion of conspiracy theories. It discusses the nature of conspiracy theories, their relationship with institutional distrust, and their representation in the social media. The methodology used is based on the analysis of hashtags from over one million tweets to determine if certain theories act as "gateways" to others. The findings suggest that logical ties exist between distinct conspiracy theories, influenced by distrust towards specific institutions and amplified by the COVID-19 crisis. It is concluded that the combination of conspiracy theories is not random, but rather, it follows an internal logic that is based on distrust, since these theories are interconnected in an internally coherent way within the context of the pandemic.

<title>Affective homogeneity in the Spanish general election debate. A comparative analysis of social networks political agents</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1499792</url>
<snippet>Many experts in the social sciences are studying the extent to which the agents of democratic political systems tend to strengthen their points of view to such an extent that it reduces their capacity to engage and debate with those who hold different points of view. This phenomenon, called polarization, is also present in public debate on social networks and has generated a significant number of studies and empirical research. In this context, a few noteworthy factors in the study of polarization are the concepts of 'homophily' and 'homogeneity'. These terms refer to the fragmenting effect of social networks and are the consequence of the common characteristics and attributes of the members that comprise them. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon in relation with the General Elections for the Presidency of Spain and, particularly, in the case of the candidature of the political party UnidosPodemos. We used data from the Twitter social network to analyze the subjects of debate, and the affective positions in relation with each of these. We found that the most active political agents had postures that were clearly homogenized in affective terms. Finally, we discuss the polarizing effects of this homogenization.

<title>Networks of Contention: The Shape of Online Transnationalism in Early Twenty-First Century Social Movement Coalitions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2013.832621</url>
<snippet>The study of new media use by transnational social movements is central to contemporary investigations of social contention. In order to shed light on the terrain in which the most recent examples of online mobilization have grown and developed, this paper combines the interest in the transnational dynamics of social contention and the exploration of the use of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) for protest action. In specific terms, the study investigates how early twenty-first century social movement coalitions used Internet tools to build symbolically transnational collective identities. By applying a hyperlink network analysis approach, the study focuses on a website network generated by local chapters of the World Social Forum (WSF), one of the earliest social movement coalitions for global justice. The sample network, selected through snowball sampling, is composed of 222 social forum websites from around the world. The study specifically looks at hyperlinks among social forum websites as signs of belonging and potential means of alliance. The analysis uses network measures, namely of cohesion, centrality, structural equivalence and homophily, to test dynamics of symbolic collective identification underlying the WSF coalition. The findings show that in early twenty-first century transnational contention, culture and place still played a central role in the emergence of transnational movement networks.

<title>Networked collective intelligence improves dissemination of scientific information regarding smoking risks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227813</url>
<snippet>Despite substantial investments in public health campaigns, misunderstanding of health-related scientific information is pervasive. This is especially true in the case of tobacco use, where smokers have been found to systematically misperceive scientific information about the negative health effects of smoking, in some cases leading smokers to increase their prosmoking bias. Here, we extend recent work on `networked collective intelligence' by testing the hypothesis that allowing smokers and nonsmokers to collaboratively evaluate anti-smoking advertisements in online social networks can improve their ability to accurately assess the negative health effects of tobacco use. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we conducted an online experiment where smokers and nonsmokers (N = 1600) were exposed to anti-smoking advertisements and asked to estimate the negative health effects of tobacco use, either on their own or in the presence of peer influence in a social network. Contrary to popular predictions, we find that both smokers and nonsmokers were surprisingly inaccurate at interpreting anti-smoking messages, and their errors persisted if they continued to interpret these messages on their own. However, smokers and nonsmokers significantly improved in their ability to accurately interpret anti-smoking messages by sharing their opinions in structured online social networks. Specifically, subjects in social networks reduced the error of their risk estimates by over 10 times more than subjects who revised solely based on individual reflection (p &lt; 0.001, 10 experimental trials in total). These results suggest that social media networks may be used to activate social learning that improves the public's ability to accurately interpret vital public health information.

<title>Monitoring obesity prevalence in the United States through bookmarking activities in online food portals</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179144</url>
<snippet>Studying the impact of food consumption on people's health is a serious matter for its implications on public policy, but it has traditionally been a slow process since it requires information gathered through expensive collection processes such as surveys, census and systematic reviews of research articles. We argue that this process could be supported and hastened using data collected via online social networks. In this work we investigate the relationships between the online traces left behind by users of a large US online food community and the prevalence of obesity in 47 states and 311 counties in the US. Using data associated with the recipes bookmarked over an 9-year period by 144,839 users of the Allrecipes. com food website residing throughout the US, several hierarchical regression models are created to (i) shed light on these relations and (ii) establish their magnitude. The results of our analysis provide strong evidence that bookmarking activities on recipes in online food communities can provide a signal allowing food and health related issues, such as obesity to be better understood and monitored. We discover that higher fat and sugar content in bookmarked recipes is associated with higher rates of obesity. The dataset is complicated, but strong temporal and geographical trends are identifiable. We show the importance of accounting for these trends in the modeling process.

<title>Online Social Networks (OSN) Evolution Model Based on Homophily and Preferential Attachment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym10110654</url>
<snippet>In this paper, we propose a new scale-free social networks (SNs) evolution model that is based on homophily combined with preferential attachments. Our model enables the SN researchers to generate SN synthetic data for the evaluation of multi-facet SN models that are dependent on users' attributes and similarities. Homophily is one of the key factors for interactive relationship formation in SN. The synthetic graph generated by our model is scale-invariant and has symmetric relationships. The model is dynamic and sustainable to changes in input parameters, such as number of nodes and nodes' attributes, by conserving its structural properties. Simulation and evaluation of models for large-scale SN applications need large datasets. One way to get SN data is to generate synthetic data by using SN evolution models. Various SN evolution models are proposed to approximate the real-life SN graphs in previous research. These models are based on SN structural properties such as preferential attachment. The data generated by these models is suitable to evaluate SN models that are structure dependent but not suitable to evaluate models which depend on the SN users' attributes and similarities. In our proposed model, users' attributes and similarities are utilized to synthesize SN graphs. We evaluated the resultant synthetic graph by analyzing its structural properties. In addition, we validated our model by comparing its measures with the publicly available real-life SN datasets and previous SN evolution models. Simulation results show our resultant graph to be a close representation of real-life SN graphs with users' attributes.

<title>Fighting fake news in the COVID-19 era: policy insights from an equilibrium model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11077-020-09405-z</url>
<snippet>The COVID-19 crisis has revealed structural failures in governance and coordination on a global scale. With related policy interventions dependent on verifiable evidence, pandemics require governments to not only consider the input of experts but also ensure that science is translated for public understanding. However, misinformation and fake news, including content shared through social media, compromise the efficacy of evidence-based policy interventions and undermine the credibility of scientific expertise with potentially longer-term consequences. We introduce a formal mathematical model to understand factors influencing the behavior of social media users when encountering fake news. The model illustrates that direct efforts by social media platforms and governments, along with informal pressure from social networks, can reduce the likelihood that users who encounter fake news embrace and further circulate it. This study has implications at a practical level for crisis response in politically fractious settings and at a theoretical level for research about post-truth and the construction of fact.

<title>Sources of Segregation in Social Networks: A Novel Approach Using Facebook</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122417705656</url>
<snippet>Most research on segregation in social networks considers small circles of strong ties, and little is known about segregation among the much larger number of weaker ties. This article proposes a novel approach to the study of these more extended networks, through the use of data on personal ties in an online social network. We illustrate this method's potential by describing and explaining the degree of ethnic and gender segregation on Facebook among a representative survey of adolescents in the Netherlands (N = 2,810; similar to 1.1 million Facebook friends). The results show that large online networks are more strongly segregated by ethnicity than by gender. Drawing on the same survey data, we find that core networks are more segregated in terms of ethnicity and gender than are extended networks. However, an exception to this pattern is personal networks of ethnic majority members, whose core networks are as segregated by ethnicity as their extended networks. Further analysis suggests this exception is due to their larger population size and the ethnic segregation of their social settings. We discuss the implications of these findings for the role of structural opportunities, homophily, and balance.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1511273113</url>
<snippet>Strong social capital is increasingly recognized as an organizational advantage. Better knowledge sharing and reduced transaction costs increase work efficiency. To mimic the formation of the associated communication network, we propose the Expert Game, where each individual must find a specific expert and receive her help. Participants act in an impersonal environment and under time constraints that provide short-term incentives for noncooperative behavior. Despite these constraints, we observe cooperation between individuals and the self-organization of a sustained trust network, which facilitates efficient communication channels with increased information flow. We build a behavioral model that explains the experimental dynamics. Analysis of the model reveals an exploitation protection mechanism and measurable social capital, which quantitatively describe the economic utility of trust.

<snippet>The present study relies on the 2010 Canadian Internet Use Survey to investigate differences in people's access to the internet and level of online activity. The study not only revisits the digital divide in the Canadian context, but also expands current investigations by including an analysis of how demographic factors affect social networking site (SNS) adoption. The findings demonstrate that access to the internet reflects existing inequalities in society with income, education, rural/urban, immigration status, and age all affecting adoption patterns. Furthermore, the results show that inequality in access to the internet is now being mimicked in the level of online activity of internet users. More recent immigrants to Canada have lower rates of internet access; however, recent immigrants who are online have significantly higher levels of online activity than Canadian born residents and earlier immigrants. Additionally, women perform fewer activities online than men. People's use of SNSs differs in terms of education, gender, and age. Women were significantly more likely to use SNSs than men. Interestingly, high school graduates had the lowest percentage of adoption compared to all other education categories. Current students were by far the group that utilized SNSs the most. Canadian born, recent, and early immigrants all showed similar adoption rates of SNSs. Age is a strong predictor of SNS usage, with young people relying heavily on SNSs in comparison to those aged 55+. The findings demonstrate that the digital divide not only persists, but has expanded to include inequality in the level of online activity and SNS usage.

<title>Beyond the Boundaries: Exploring the Identity-Related Experiences of Biracial/Multiracial and Bisexual Adults</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-021-02236-w</url>
<snippet>Most prior bisexual research takes a monolithic approach to racial identity, and existing racial/ethnic minority research often overlooks bisexuality. Consequently, previous studies have rarely examined the experiences and unique health needs of biracial/multiracial and bisexual individuals. This exploratory qualitative study investigated the identity-related experiences of biracial/multiracial and bisexual adults within the context of health and well-being. Data were collected through 90-min semi-structured telephone interviews. Participants were recruited through online social network sites and included 24 adults between ages 18 and 59 years. We aimed to explore how identity-related experiences shape biracial/multiracial and bisexual individuals' identity development processes; how biracial/multiracial and bisexual individuals negotiate their identities; how the blending of multiple identities may contribute to perceptions of inclusion, exclusion, and social connectedness; and how biracial/multiracial and bisexual individuals may attribute positive and negative experiences to their identities. Interview transcripts were analyzed using an inductive thematic approach. Analysis highlighted four major themes: passing and invisible identities, not measuring up and erasing complexity, cultural binegativity/queerphobia and intersectional oppressions, and navigating beyond boundaries. Our findings imply promoting affirmative visibility and developing intentional support networks may help biracial/multiracial and bisexual individuals cultivate resiliency and navigate sources of identity stress. We encourage future research to explore mental health and chronic stress among this community.

<title>Firms' challenges and social responsibilities during Covid-19: A Twitter analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254748</url>
<snippet>This paper offers insights on the major issues and challenges firms face in the Covid-19 pandemic and their concerns for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) themes. To do so, we investigate large Italian firms' discussions on Twitter in the first nine months of the pandemic. Specifically, we ask: How is firms' Twitter discussion developing during the Covid-19 pandemic? Which CSR dimensions and topics do firms discuss? To what extent do they resonate with the public? We downloaded Twitter posts by the accounts of large Italian firms, and we built the bipartite network of accounts and hashtags. Using an entropy-based null model as a benchmark, we projected the information contained in the network into the accounts layers, identifying a network of accounts. We find that the network is composed of 13 communities and accounts at the core of the network focus on environmental sustainability, digital innovation, and safety. Firms' ownership type does not seem to influence the conversation. While the relevance of CSR hashtags and stakeholder engagement is relatively small, peculiarities arise in some communities. Overall, our paper highlights the contribution of online social networks and complex networks methods for management and strategy research, showing the role of online social media in understanding firms' issues, challenges, and responsibilities, with common narratives naturally emerging from data.

<title>Social recommendation model based on user interaction in complex social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0218957</url>
<snippet>The user interaction in online social networks can not only reveal the social relationships among users in e-commerce systems, but also imply the social preferences of a target user for recommendation services. However, the current research has rarely explored the impact of social interaction on recommendation performance, especially now that recommender systems face increasing challenges and suffer from poor efficiency due to social data overload. Therefore, applied research on user interaction has become increasingly necessary in the field of social recommendation. In this paper, we develop a novel social recommendation method based on the user interaction in complex social networks, called the SRUI model, to present a basis for improving the efficiency of the recommender systems. Specifically, a weighted social interaction network is first mapped to represent the interactions among social users according to the gathered information about historical user behavior. Thereafter, the complete path set is mined by the complete path mining (CPM) algorithm to find social similar neighbors with tastes similar to those of the target user. Finally, the social similar tendencies of the users on the complete paths are obtained to predict the final ratings of items through the SRUI model. A series of experimental results based on two real public datasets show that our approach performs better than other state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation performance.

<title>The Sexual Networks of Racially Diverse Young Men Who Have Sex with Men</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-015-0485-5</url>
<snippet>Young men who have sex with men are at increased risk for HIV. Research with older men and high-risk populations suggests that network dynamics may contribute to the spread of infectious disease and HIV, but little is known about the sexual networks of young men who have sex with men. Utilizing a unique dataset, this study presents novel descriptive data about the sexual networks of racially diverse 17- to 23-year-old young men who have sex with men. Additionally, individual, partner, and network characteristics of these young men who have sex with men were examined as potential drivers of HIV, STI, and unprotected intercourse. Results indicated several partner- and network-level factors associated with HIV and associated outcomes.

<title>Do I Deserve to Spend? Online Social Support and Spending Pleasure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1938965520973576</url>
<snippet>Despite evidence of people posting their consumption experiences to online social networks to fulfill the needs of social support, an understanding of how online social support affects post-consumption spending behaviors remains elusive. This research aims to examine how online social support from online social network friends and the firm influence perceptions of self-deservingness and spending pleasure. Across two studies, this research provides evidence that social support gained through online social networks influences consumers' spending pleasure through perceptions of their own deservingness. Notably, this study reveals that people obtain social support in online social networks from two sources: social networks friends and firms through receiving "Likes" and "Comments" on their post. This study also explores boundary conditions for when online social support is more effective on spending pleasure. The findings not only broaden the social support literature but also address the benefit to the service industry by understanding how social support can enhance spending pleasure.

<title>Do diverse geographical contexts lead to diverse friendship networks? A multilevel analysis of Belgian survey data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.09.003</url>
<snippet>The choice-constraint approach assumes that the choice of one's friends will be determined by both individual choices and the constraints imposed by one's interaction context. Trends towards homophily however, might counteract this effect if actors consistently seek interaction partners with the same background characteristics. In this study we investigate the impact of community level diversity on the cultural diversity of friendship networks. Based on a multilevel analysis of recent survey data from Flanders (Belgium). we demonstrate that community level diversity has a significant but limited impact on ethnic and religious friendship network diversity. Controlling for individual level characteristics, residents of ethnically diverse communities report more ethnically and religiously diverse friendships. The fact that ethnic and religious diversity overlap to such a large extent suggests that both divisions are closely related in contemporary secularized European societies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

<title>Inequality in Access to Social Capital in the Netherlands</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0038038514543294</url>
<snippet>Whereas much research has been done on the benefits of social capital, less is known about the causes of the unequal distribution of social capital in people's networks. This study examines inequalities in access to social capital in terms of the socio-economic resources that are embedded in personal networks. Using data from NELLS, a nationally representative survey of the Dutch population aged 15-45 years, results show that within this age group access to social capital increases with age and educational qualifications, and is lower among women. Residing in a less affluent neighbourhood and scoring lower on a measurement for cognitive abilities are associated with less social capital. Participation in voluntary associations and having an ethnically diverse network are associated with more access to social capital. Surprisingly, when studying differences across national origin groups, we do not find that Turkish immigrants are disadvantaged in access to social capital.

<title>When Does Race Matter? Race, Sex, and Dating at an Elite University</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2009.00683.x</url>
<snippet>This paper unites quantitative and qualitative data from the College Social Life Survey (n = 732) to describe and explain patterns of racial homophily in undergraduate sexual/romantic relationships at an elite university, a closed social setting. It expands the literature on interracial romantic unions by comparing homophily in hookups ( uncommitted sexual interactions), dates, and long-term relationships. Although this population embodies many characteristics associated with greater racial mixing ( youth, education, status equality, geographical proximity, racial diversity, independence from family), racial homophily is still strongly evident. Variation in levels of homophily among relationship types and among racial groups is explained by differences in desired homophily, social network segregation, and participation in formal race-based student organizations. Black students are particularly socially isolated.

<title>A Mixed Methods Research Approach to Exploring Teacher Participation in an Online Social Networking Website</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1609406915624578</url>
<snippet>Social networks are becoming very prominent in educational discourse. The discourse centers on the role of social media and its utility in the teaching and learning environment. Several arguments have been made to support its use because they are highly collaborative, easily accessible, and provide opportunities to embed a variety of Web 2.0 tools such as blogs, wikis, and online chats. However, there is a dearth in research on teacher use of educational social networking sites (SNS) in Trinidad and Tobago. The purpose of this study was to explore how 35 secondary school teachers in Trinidad and Tobago participated in an educational online social networking site. This study utilized a mixed methods exploratory approach and allowed for the use of online data capture together with questionnaires and interviews. Combined data analysis revealed five different levels of site participation, with most teachers adopting the role of content consumer rather than of content producer. Barriers to participation were time, motivation, technology, and usability. The designed social networking site allowed teachers to make public their discourse on their practice while connecting with colleagues from other schools. The study was qualitative dominant, with the mixed methods research approach allowing for deeper exploration of teachers' participation on this social networking website, and was justified by the newness and transient nature of data from social networking websites.

<title>Comparative study of social networks in post-socialist Western Balkan countries. Formal and informal networking for information diffusion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.12775/EEC.2020.005</url>
<snippet>Rural areas in the Western Balkan are faced with severe socio-economic and political challenges, including a lack of access to knowledge and information as well as scepticism about formal forms of cooperation. Yet, the evidence regarding the influence of social capital and network structures on the access of the rural population to information and knowledge in these countries is still sparse, even though this can be one of the most influential factors shaping rural development. In this paper, a multi-country comparison was applied to provide empirical evidence of the existing level of social capital structures (networks) in North Macedonia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The conducted analyses indicate that even with the low participation rates, all farmers, both members and non-members of organisations, perceived membership in formal organisations as useful. Additionally, the results support the presumption that even sparse informal networks, mostly built on strong personal ties, are more effective channels for information transfer in the absence of efficient/active formalised types of cooperation. 'this implies that rural development policy should be crafted in a way to transform farmers from passive subjects into creative actors, particularly in sharing and promoting good practices.

<title>Discovering why people believe disinformation about healthcare</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0300497</url>
<snippet>Disinformation-false information intended to cause harm or for profit-is pervasive. While disinformation exists in several domains, one area with great potential for personal harm from disinformation is healthcare. The amount of disinformation about health issues on social media has grown dramatically over the past several years, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study described in this paper sought to determine the characteristics of multimedia social network posts that lead them to believe and potentially act on healthcare disinformation. The study was conducted in a neuroscience laboratory in early 2022. Twenty-six study participants each viewed a series of 20 either honest or dishonest social media posts, dealing with various aspects of healthcare. They were asked to determine if the posts were true or false and then to provide the reasoning behind their choices. Participant gaze was captured through eye tracking technology and investigated through "area of interest" analysis. This approach has the potential to discover the elements of disinformation that help convince the viewer a given post is true. Participants detected the true nature of the posts they were exposed to 69&#37; of the time. Overall, the source of the post, whether its claims seemed reasonable, and the look and feel of the post were the most important reasons they cited for determining whether it was true or false. Based on the eye tracking data collected, the factors most associated with successfully detecting disinformation were the total number of fixations on key words and the total number of revisits to source information. The findings suggest the outlines of generalizations about why people believe online disinformation, suggesting a basis for the development of mid-range theory.

<title>The Origins of Religious Homophily in a Medium and Large School</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13644-016-0266-1</url>
<snippet>How religion influences social interactions, and how social interactions influence religion, are fundamental questions to the sociology of religion. We address these processes and build on Cheadle and Schwadel's (Soc Sci Res 41: 1198-1212, 2012) analysis of selection and influence in religion-based social tie homogeneity (i.e. network-religion autocorrelation) in small schools by analyzing networks from larger schools, by focusing on differences across schools, and by testing different operationalizations of social influence. Using two waves of full network data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and dynamic longitudinal network SIENA models, we find (1) that both selection and influence impact network-religion autocorrelation; (2) that the factors influencing network-religion autocorrelation vary across school contexts; and (3) that religious influence is proportional to the number of friends in an adolescent's network, which means influence reflects both the size of an individual's network and the consistency of religion among members of the network. We conclude by addressing potential reasons for differences across school contexts and by discussing the theoretical logic behind the total similarity effect that best operationalized religious influence.

<title>PLAYING IN THE SAME TWITTER NETWORK Political information seeking in the 2010 US gubernatorial elections</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2012.706316</url>
<snippet>New media platforms such as Twitter allow users to choose from a wide range of political information sources including traditional media, politicians, bloggers and other Twitter users. This study extends the theory of channel complementarity by considering the complementary selection of information sources that occur within a single social media space. This study also conceptualizes information seeking as a social network created by follow relationships on Twitter, allowing tracking actual patterns of source selection. We applied this theoretical and methodological framework to examine information seeking on Twitter related to four US gubernatorial races. We identified the main types of highly followed accounts (i.e. information hubs). Traditional news media outlets (national and local) accounted for nearly half of the information hubs, and grassroots sources such as activists and other users accounted for nearly a third. The patterns of follow relationships indicated local and national subgroups (i.e. clusters) of users identified based on network topology. Local clusters included a subgroup of more densely interconnected users in which local news media and political candidates were hubs. National clusters included a subgroup of more sparsely interconnected users in which national media and online-only news sources served as hubs. High-density clusters were also more likely to host information sources that exhibited two-way information flow with other users, while low-density clusters preferred hubs that follow traditional one-to-many information flow. Theoretical and practical implications for news media and political candidates are discussed.

<title>Developing an agent-based model to minimize spreading of malicious information in dynamic social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-023-09375-6</url>
<snippet>This research introduces a systematic and multidisciplinary agent-based model to interpret and simplify the dynamic actions of the users and communities in an evolutionary online (offline) social network. The organizational cybernetics approach is used to control/monitor the malicious information spread between communities. The stochastic one-median problem minimizes the agent response time and eliminates the information spread across the online (offline) environment. The performance of these methods was measured against a Twitter network related to an armed protest demonstration against the COVID-19 lockdown in Michigan state in May 2020. The proposed model demonstrated the dynamicity of the network, enhanced the agent level performance, minimized the malicious information spread, and measured the response to the second stochastic information spread in the network.

<title>Information Spreading on Weighted Multiplex Social Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/5920187</url>
<snippet>Information spreading on multiplex networks has been investigated widely. For multiplex networks, the relations of each layer possess different extents of intimacy, which can be described as weighted multiplex networks. Nevertheless, the effect of weighted multiplex network structures on information spreading has not been analyzed comprehensively. We herein propose an information spreading model on a weighted multiplex network. Then, we develop an edge-weight-based compartmental theory to describe the spreading dynamics. We discover that under any adoption threshold of two subnetworks, reducing weight distribution heterogeneity does not alter the growth pattern of the final adoption size versus information transmission probability while accelerating information spreading. For fixed weight distribution, the growth pattern changes with the heterogeneous of degree distribution. There is a critical initial seed size, below which no global information outbreak can occur. Extensive numerical simulations affirm that the theoretical predictions agree well with the numerical results.

<title>Mention effect in information diffusion on a micro-blogging network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194192</url>
<snippet>Micro-blogging systems have become one of the most important ways for information sharing. Network structure and users' interactions such as forwarding behaviors have aroused considerable research attention, while mention, as a key feature in micro-blogging platforms which can improve the visibility of a message and direct it to a particular user beyond the underlying social structure, is seldom studied in previous works. In this paper, we empirically study the mention effect in information diffusion, using the dataset from a population-scale social media website. We find that users with high number of followers would receive much more mentions than others. We further investigate the effect of mention in information diffusion by examining the response probability with respect to the number of mentions in a message and observe a saturation at around 5 mentions. Furthermore, we find that the response probability is the highest when a reciprocal followship exists between users, and one is more likely to receive a target user's response if they have similar social status. To illustrate these findings, we propose the response prediction task and formulate it as a binary classification problem. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of discovered factors. Our results have consequences for the understanding of human dynamics on the social network, and potential implications for viral marketing and public opinion monitoring.

<title>The emergence of complex adaptive response networks in China: A case study of four disasters</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/risa.14121</url>
<snippet>This study aims to identify the driving forces behind interorganizational networks in China following disasters. Using the theory of complex adaptive systems, we identified the self-organization process of disaster response as the network formation process. We identified interorganizational networks that emerged in response to two natural hazards and two technical disasters by collecting data from multiple sources. The exponential random model analysis is performed to analyze the effects of structures and organizational attributes on network formation. In structuring networks for disaster response, findings demonstrate that bonding structures take precedence over bridging structures for organizations. Meanwhile, the sector and jurisdiction-based homophily effects facilitate network formation in disaster response. On the basis of research findings, five propositions describing the network formation process in China's disaster response are proposed. Such a theoretical model is essential for advancing research and practice in complex disaster network management.

<title>Crisis Communications in the Age of Social Media: A Network Analysis of Zika-Related Tweets</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439317721985</url>
<snippet>While emerging technologies such as social media have demonstrated value for crisis communications, significant question remains regarding how these tools can be most effectively leveraged to facilitate the flow of valid information under crisis conditions. In an effort to address these issues, this article examines the use of Twitter during the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak in the United States. Particular attention is paid to network structures within the Zika conversation and how different actors and communities contribute to the flow of information throughout the broader Twitter community. Public-facing organizations can benefit from a deeper understanding of the nature and structure of spontaneously occurring communities on social media as well as the types of content that they create and circulate. As such, these findings have significant implications for the development of effective social media strategies during natural disasters and public health emergencies. In particular, this analysis identifies several predominant themes communicated through Zika-related tweets as well as a number of distinct communities and influential actors. The findings suggest that respected political actors, public institutions, as well as those with valid scientific credentials can help to facilitate the flow of accurate and vital information across disparate communities.

<title>Making stability dependable: stable cellphone access leads to better health outcomes for those experiencing poverty</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2021.1928263</url>
<snippet>The technology maintenance framework argues that digital access is unreliable and thus consequential for individual/social welfare. However, no one has demonstrated a causal effect of cell phone access on health and well-being. Using a 7-month longitudinal field experiment we investigated how stable cellphone access impacts health and quality of life of people experiencing poverty (N = 45, median annual income = $7,216). Participants received phone cards providing unlimited talk, text, and data (n = 23) or were given grocery store gift cards of the equivalent amount (n = 22). Over the course of the experiment, participants in the treatment group reported better health and quality of life compared to those in the control group. Emotional social support moderated this relationship in such a way that those with the least social support benefited the most from stable cellphone access (supporting a 'poor-get-richer' hypothesis). We present practical and theoretical implications in the discussion.

<title>Diffusion of pro- and anti-false information tweets: the Black Panther movie case</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-018-09286-x</url>
<snippet>Much has been made of the importance of the speed at which disinformation diffuses through online social media and this speed is an important aspect to consider when designing interventions. An additional complexity is that there can be different types of false information that travel from and through different communities who respond in various ways within the same social media conversation. Here we present a case study/example analysis exploring the speed and reach of three different types of false stories found in the Black Panther movie Twitter conversation and comparing the diffusion of these stories with the community responses to them. We find that the negative reaction to fake stories of racially-motivated violence whether in the form of debunking quotes or satirical posts can spread at speeds that are magnitudes higher than the original fake stories. Satire posts, while less viral than debunking quotes, appear to have longer lifetimes in the conversation. We also found that the majority of mixed community members who originally spread fake stories switched to attacking them. Our work serves as an example of the importance of analyzing the diffusion of both different types of disinformation and the different responses to it within the same overall conversation.

<title>Effects of Online Christian Self-Disclosure on Impression Formation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-5906.2010.01522.x</url>
<snippet>This experiment examined the effects of online Christian disclosure. Respondents (N = 233) viewed a fictional social networking profile containing one of three levels of Christian disclosure frequency: none, nominal, and extensive. Respondents made few distinctions between nondisclosure and nominal disclosure. Most notably, respondent religiosity moderated impressions. Regardless of disclosure level, religious respondents rated profile owners as more likeable and less stereotypically negative than less religious respondents. The least religious respondents tended to rate the extensively disclosing Christian as least romantically desirable and with more negative stereotyping. The most religious respondents rated the extensively disclosing Christian as most likeable and as most romantically desirable. Christian identity tended to be assumed when not disclosed. Nominal disclosure may constitute a socially acceptable level of online Christian disclosure.

<title>CENTRALISED DECENTRALISATION OF TOURISM DEVELOPMENT: A NETWORK PERSPECTIVE</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2012.09.005</url>
<snippet>While there is increasing recognition of the positive impacts of tourism on economic development in Sub-Saharan Africa, existing relationships between tourism industry stakeholders is fraught with challenges that constrain its development. Drawing on social network theory and stakeholder theory and through a series of key informant semi-structured interviews with tourism industry stakeholders, the paper explores the nature of participation by destination stakeholders in formulating and implementing tourism policy in Cameroon. It then explores a model of tourism development built around a centrally coordinated but decentralized tourism network that reaches out to all representative stakeholders when formulating and implementing tourism policies. The challenges involved in mobilizing destination stakeholders into such a system to allow for effective tourism development are critically examined.

<title>CONTEMPORARY RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY AND THE ONLINE CHURCH</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2011.591410</url>
<snippet>'Online churches' are Internet-based Christian communities, seeking to pursue worship, discussion, friendship, support, proselytism and other key religious practices through computer-mediated communication. This article introduces findings of a four-year ethnographic study of five very different 'online churches', focusing on the fluid, multi-layered relationship between online and offline activity developed by Christian users of blogs, forums, chatrooms, video streams and virtual worlds. Following a review of online church research and a summary of methods, this article offers an overview of each of the five groups and identifies clear parallels with earlier television ministries and recent church-planting movements. A new model of online and offline activity is proposed, focused on two pairs of concepts, familiarity/difference and isolation/integration, represented as the endpoints of two axes. These axes frame a landscape of digital practice, negotiated with great care and subtlety by online churchgoers. These negotiations are interpreted in light of wider social changes, particularly the shift from bounded community towards 'networked individualism'.

<title>Perceived healthcare provider reactions to patient and caregiver use of online health communities</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2014.05.015</url>
<snippet>Objective: Many Internet users seek health information through online health communities (OHCs) and other social media. Yet few studies assess how individuals use peer-generated health information, and many healthcare providers (HCPs) believe OHCs interfere with patient-provider relationships. This study explored how individuals use OHC content in clinical discussions and how HCPs react to it. Methods: We conducted in-person and virtual focus groups with patients/caregivers who visited OHCs (n = 89). A trained moderator asked about reasons for membership, sharing OHC content with providers, HCP reactions, and preferred roles for HCPs. Two researchers independently coded verbatim transcripts (NVivo 9.2) and conducted thematic response analysis. Results: Participants described OHCs as supplementing information from HCPs, whom they perceived as too busy for detailed discussions. Almost all participants shared OHC content with HCPs, although only half cited OHCs as the source. Most HCPs reacted negatively to OHC content, making participants feel disempowered. Despite these reactions, participants continued to use OHCs, and most desired HCP feedback on the accuracy of OHC content. Conclusions: Individuals do not use OHCs to circumvent HCPs but instead to gather more in-depth information. Practice implications: HCPs should discuss OHC content with patients to help them avoid misinformation and make more informed decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

<title>Social network influences on smoking, drinking and drug use in secondary school: centrifugal and centripetal forces</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9566.2012.01522.x</url>
<snippet>We explore how school experiences and social networks structure young people's substance use in different institutional contexts. The concepts of selection' and influence' are situated within the context of bounded agency, counter-school cultures and Bourdieusian notions of capital. We employed individual and group interviews, network-mapping, and observations at two contrasting English secondary schools. Both schools were characterised by extended social network structures that appeared to influence patterns of substance use, although the mechanisms via which this occurred varied according to school context. At Grange House school (suburban context) a minority of students from disadvantaged families were alienated by the attainment-focused regime, marginalised by a strong peer-led centrifugal force pushing them outwards, and substance use was an alternative source of bonding and identity for these students. In contrast, at North Street a centripetal force operated whereby the majority of students were pulled towards highly-visible, normative markers of safe', road culture', such as cannabis use and gang-involvement, as they attempted to fit in and survive in an inner-city school environment. We conclude that health inequalities may be reproduced through these distinctive centrifugal and centripetal forces in different institutional contexts, and this should be the focus of quantitative examination in the UK and elsewhere.

<title>Alliance-building for equity and justice: An inter-organizational perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2023.102382</url>
<snippet>Cultivating alliances between specific sectors or fields with unrealized synergies is a promising strategy for systems change. Social network analysis is a useful tool for assessing whether such alliances build relationships between these previously disparate organizations. Two waves of valued network data were collected from the members (N = 25) of a justice system reform coalition composed of two types of community-based organizations: those involved in restorative justice practice and those involved in grassroots community organizing. Social network homophily analyses were employed to characterize the impact of alliance participation on relationships over time across three domains: working together, doing impactful work together, and sharing a philosophy about justice system reform. Results indicate marked increases in the prevalence of relationships between restorative justice and community organizing organizations across all domains, with the greatest increases occurring in perceptions of shared philosophy. Network structures at each time point differed by relational domain and organization type. Findings suggest that the alliance strengthened relationships between restorative justice and community organizing organizations, particularly in perceptions of shared philosophy, but that the magnitude of these changes varied depending on pre-existing interorganizational relationships and organization type. Findings challenge the idea that close working relationships between diverse members is critical to coalition effectiveness, pointing instead to the value of ambidextrous networks and alignment in members' philosophy and vision.

<title>Sentiment cascades in the 15M movement</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-015-0042-4</url>
<snippet>Recent grassroots movements have suggested that online social networks might play a key role in their organization, as adherents have a fast, many-to-many, communication channel to help coordinate their mobilization. The structure and dynamics of the networks constructed from the digital traces of protesters have been analyzed to some extent recently. However, less effort has been devoted to the analysis of the semantic content of messages exchanged during the protest. Using the data obtained from a microblogging service during the brewing and active phases of the 15M movement in Spain, we perform the first large scale test of theories on collective emotions and social interaction in collective actions. Our findings show that activity and information cascades in the movement are larger in the presence of negative collective emotions and when users express themselves in terms related to social content. At the level of individual participants, our results show that their social integration in the movement, as measured through social network metrics, increases with their level of engagement and of expression of negativity. Our findings show that non-rational factors play a role in the formation and activity of social movements through online media, having important consequences for viral spreading.

<title>The role of tie strength in assessing credibility of scientific content on facebook</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101261</url>
<snippet>Social networking sites have become a major venue for dissemination of- and discussions about science-related topics. On these platforms, message credibility assessment takes into account not only traditional cues (like scientific arguments and information source), but also new types of social cues. Of the latter, we focus on tie strength, a central component of social networking sites, which has an important role in information flow, and the role of which in the process of message credibility assessment has been so far overlooked. We also consider two important and relevant meta-cognitive measures: need for cognition and expertise perception. Applying an experimental design in Facebook (N = 324), our findings suggest that need for cognition weakens the positive associations between tie strength and perceived message credibility. Also, both expertise perception and tie strength have positive effect on perceived message credibility.

<title>An Approach to Evolutionary Sociology and its Implications for Theorizing on Socio-Cultural Evolution</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11577-024-00939-1</url>
<snippet>A theoretical research program is outlined that seeks to use the Modern Synthesis in explaining human evolution, but also recognizes its limitations in explaining the evolution of socio-cultural systems. The universe, from a human perspective, is composed of physical, biological, and socio-cultural dimensions, each revealing unique properties and dynamics. In the case of the socio-cultural universe, modern evolutionary theory is relevant for some explanations, but not to the degree assumed by socio-biology, evolutionary psychology, and even co-evolutionary models. The program proposed is built around social network theory, cladistic analysis, and comparative neuro-anatomy, and outlines where biological analysis is appropriate and useful. An understanding of the biological basis of human behavior will allow sociologists to develop theoretical approaches to explaining the emergent properties of the socio-cultural universe. The strategy outlined will allow us to see what a mature evolutionary sociology can do: develop abstract theoretical laws about the dynamics of selection on socio-cultural formations in human societies. Es wird ein theoretisches Forschungsprogramm skizziert, das Thesen der ,,Modernen Synthese" zur Erklarung der menschlichen Evolution aufgreift, aber auch deren Grenzen bei der Erklarung der Evolution soziokultureller Systeme aufdeckt. Aus der Humanperspektive besteht die Welt aus physikalischen, biologischen und soziokulturellen Dimensionen, die jeweils eigenartige Eigenschaften und Dynamiken aufweisen. Im Falle der soziokulturellen Dimension ist die moderne Evolutionstheorie zwar fur einige Erklarungen relevant, jedoch nicht in dem Masse, wie es von der Soziobiologie, der Evolutionspsychologie und sogar von den ko-evolutionaren Modellen angenommen wird. Das vorgeschlagene Programm stutzt sich auf die Theorie sozialer Netzwerke, die kladistische Analyse und die vergleichende Neuroanatomie. Es zeigt auf, wo eine biologische Analyse angebracht und nutzlich ist. Ein Verstandnis der biologischen Grundlagen des menschlichen Verhaltens wird es Soziologen ermoglichen, theoretische Ansatze zur Erklarung der emergenten Eigenschaften der soziokulturellen Sphare zu entwickeln. Die skizzierte Forschungsstrategie erlaubt uns zu zeigen, was eine ausgereifte evolutionare Soziologie leisten kann: die Entwicklung abstrakter theoretischer Gesetze uber die Dynamik der Selektion in Bezug auf soziokulturelle Formationen in menschlichen Gesellschaften.

<title>Assessing structural correlates to social capital in Facebook ego networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.01.002</url>
<snippet>Research in computer-mediated communication has consistently asserted that Facebook use is positively correlated with social capital. This research has drawn primarily on Williams' (2006) bridging and bonding scales as well as behavioral attributes such as civic engagement. Yet, as social capital is inherently a structural construct, it is surprising that so little work has been done relating social capital to social structure as captured by social network site (SNS) Friendship networks. Facebook is particularly well-suited to support the examination of structure at the ego level since the networks articulated on Facebook tend to be large, dense, and indicative of many offline foci (e.g., coworkers, friends from high school). Assuming that each one of these foci only partially overlap, we initially present two hypotheses related to Facebook social networks and social capital: more foci are associated with perceptions of greater bridging social capital and more closure is associated with greater bonding social capital. Using a study of 235 employees at a Midwestern American university, we test these hypotheses alongside self-reported measures of activity on the site. Our results only partially confirm these hypotheses. In particular, using a widely used measure of closure (transitivity) we observe a strong and persistent negative relationship to bonding social capital. Although this finding is initially counter-intuitive it is easily explained by considering the topology of Facebook personal networks: networks with primarily closed triads tend to be networks with tightly bound foci (such as everyone from high school knowing each other) and few connections between foci. Networks with primarily open triads signify many crosscutting friendships across foci. Therefore, bonding social capital appears to be less tied to local clustering than to global cohesion.

<title>The Relationship between Online Social Networking and Sexual Risk Behaviors among Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM)</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062271</url>
<snippet>Online social networking usage is growing rapidly, especially among at-risk populations, such as men who have sex with men (MSM). However, little research has studied the relationship between online social networking usage and sexual risk behaviors among at-risk populations. One hundred and eighteen Facebook-registered MSM (60.1&#37; Latino, 28&#37; African American; 11.9&#37; other) were recruited from online (social networking websites and banner advertisements) and offline (local clinics, restaurants and organizations) venues frequented by minority MSM. Inclusion criteria required participants to be men who were 18 years of age or older, had had sex with a man in the past 12 months, were living in Los Angeles, and had a Facebook account. Participants completed an online survey on their social media usage and sexual risk behaviors. Results from a multivariable regression suggest that number of sexual partners met from online social networking technologies is associated with increased: 1) likelihood of having exchanged sex for food, drugs, or a place to stay within the past 3 months; 2) number of new partners within the past 3 months; 3) number of male sex partners within the past 3 months; and 4) frequency of engaging in oral sex within the past 3 months, controlling for age, race, education, and total number of sexual partners. Understanding the relationship between social media sex-seeking and sexual risk behaviors among at-risk populations will help inform population-focused HIV prevention and treatment interventions.

<title>Students' Facebook 'friends': public and private spheres</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13676260902960752</url>
<snippet>Friendship is highly significant during the university years. Facebook, widely used by students, is designed to facilitate communication with different groups of 'friends'. This exploratory study involved interviewing a sample of student users of Facebook: it focuses on the extent to which older adults, especially parents, are accepted as Facebook friends, and the attitudes towards such friendships and potential friendships and what these reveal about notions of privacy. Parents were rarely reported to be Facebook friends, and there was a view that in general they would not be welcomed. The reasons were related to embarrassment, social norms, and worries about mothers. Underlying these were various notions of the private and the public. Students did not appear to conceive of there being two distinct realms: indeed, the 'public' appeared to be the individual's private social world. A level of sophistication is apparent, with nuanced understandings of concepts, suggesting that social networking sites such as Facebook are associated with new ways of construing some of the notions surrounding the traditional public/private dichotomy. Notions of what is private and what is public are fuzzy, with no clear-cut public/private dichotomy. Computer-mediated communication appears to make this fuzziness more apparent than has hitherto been the case.

<title>WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON? Structure underlying face-to-face and online deliberation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13691180902725768</url>
<snippet>Does deliberative setting, online versus face-to-face, influence citizens' experiences? Are certain factors differently influential in one setting than in the other? We draw on a nationally representative survey and identify citizens who participated in both online and face-to-face settings (n = 82). We use structural equation modeling to first assess the effects that deliberation format has on the interrelationship between such crucial factors as motivations to deliberate, perceived diversity, elicited emotions, enhanced understanding, and goal evaluation. We later employ network analysis to ask which factor or which cluster of factors is more central to an overall experience in which format. Relying on citizens who participated in both settings and using within-subject analyses, we assure that the previously unnoted findings are attributable to the format per se rather than to individual characteristics. We discuss the theoretical, practical and methodological implications.

<title>Measuring web ecology by Facebook, Twitter, blogs and online news: 2012 general election in South Korea</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-014-0016-9</url>
<snippet>This study aimed to provide an empirical and analytical account of online information flow and web ecology in four platforms around the 2012 general election in South Korea. The study quantitatively examined the interrelationship of web ecology among relevant platforms-including online news, blogs, Twitter and Facebook-during election campaigns. In order to quantify the current political situations, this study employed network analysis and the model fitting method with co-occurrence web visibility data of political parties and their leaders in four platforms. The findings demonstrated to what extent web ecologies on four different online platforms during the given election reflect the country's political situation. Comparing network centralizations across platforms, results showed that online news was the least biased media and Twitter was the most biased with the highest centralization scores. Although both the ruling party and the major opposition party-including the leaders of those two parties-had higher degree centrality scores than minor parties and their leaders in all platforms, some distinct features were observed in Twitter and Facebook due to their attributes. In addition, regressions and their residuals confirmed that web ecologies in four platforms, in terms of degree centrality, had been linearly expanded over time and showed their individual characteristics.

<title>Science audiences, misinformation, and fake news</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1805871115</url>
<snippet>Concerns about public misinformation in the United States-ranging from politics to science-are growing. Here, we provide an overview of how and why citizens become (and sometimes remain) misinformed about science. Our discussion focuses specifically on misinformation among individual citizens. However, it is impossible to understand individual information processing and acceptance without taking into account social networks, information ecologies, and other macro-level variables that provide important social context. Specifically, we show how being misinformed is a function of a person's ability and motivation to spot falsehoods, but also of other group-level and societal factors that increase the chances of citizens to be exposed to correct(ive) information. We conclude by discussing a number of research areas-some of which echo themes of the 2017 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Communicating Science Effectively report-that will be particularly important for our future understanding of misinformation, specifically a systems approach to the problem of misinformation, the need for more systematic analyses of science communication in new media environments, and a (re)focusing on traditionally underserved audiences.

<title>Patterns of support and conflict relationships in personal networks and perceived stress</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0011392120948926</url>
<snippet>This article investigates the association between personal networks and stress, both positively through support and negatively through conflict. In a representative sample of 755 individuals residing in Switzerland, each individual was asked to name people in their lives who they perceived as very important, as well as to report their mutual support and conflict interactions. First, the article develops and investigates a typology with five relational patterns based on indicators of emotional support and conflict relationships in personal networks. These patterns are the following:bonding social capital,bridging social capital,ego-centered conflict,overload, andambivalent. Second, it explores the association of these patterns with stress levels that are perceived in various life domains. Results show that individuals involved in relationships that were predominantly supportive had lower levels of stress, whereas individuals experiencing relationships characterized by conflict, or an imbalance in support by giving more than receiving, had higher levels of stress. Finally, ambivalent relationships in which support and conflict were equally present were associated with an intermediate level of stress. These results show the importance of considering support and conflict relationships together in personal network structures.

<title>Verification in Referral-Based Crowdsourcing</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0045924</url>
<snippet>Online social networks offer unprecedented potential for rallying a large number of people to accomplish a given task. Here we focus on information gathering tasks where rare information is sought through "referral-based crowdsourcing'': the information request is propagated recursively through invitations among members of a social network. Whereas previous work analyzed incentives for the referral process in a setting with only correct reports, misreporting is known to be both pervasive in crowdsourcing applications, and difficult/costly to filter out. A motivating example for our work is the DARPA Red Balloon Challenge where the level of misreporting was very high. In order to undertake a formal study of verification, we introduce a model where agents can exert costly effort to perform verification and false reports can be penalized. This is the first model of verification and it provides many directions for future research, which we point out. Our main theoretical result is the compensation scheme that minimizes the cost of retrieving the correct answer. Notably, this optimal compensation scheme coincides with the winning strategy of the Red Balloon Challenge.

<title>Mobilization through online social networks: the political protest of the &lt;i&gt;indignados&lt;/i&gt; in Spain</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2013.808360</url>
<snippet>The 15M demonstration (the origin of the indignados movement in Spain and the seed of the occupy mobilizations) presents some outstanding characteristics that defy the established principles of the collective action paradigm. This article develops some observable implications of the concept of connective action and tests them against the case of the 15M demonstration. Cases of self-organized connective action networks are expected to be different from traditional collective action cases with regard to the characteristics of the organizations involved, the prevalent mobilization channels and the characteristics of participants. Based on a comparative analysis of data gathered from participants and organizations in nine demonstrations held in Spain between 2010 and 2011, relevant and significant differences were found in the characteristics of the 15M staging organizations (recently created, without formal membership and mainly online presence), the main mobilization channels (personal contact and online social networks rather than co-members or broadcast media), and participants (younger, more educated and less politically involved). These findings help to understand the large turnout figures of this movement and have important implications for the mobilization potential of social networks, particularly as it can affect the political participation of the less-involved citizens.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00342-w</url>
<snippet>We quantify social media user engagement with low-credibility online news media sources using a simple and intuitive methodology, that we showcase with an empirical case study of the Twitter debate on immigration in Italy. By assigning the Twitter users an Untrustworthiness (U) score based on how frequently they engage with unreliable media outlets and cross-checking it with a qualitative political annotation of the communities, we show that such information consumption is not equally distributed across the Twitter users. Indeed, we identify clusters characterised by a very high presence of accounts that frequently share content from less reliable news sources. The users with high U are more keen to interact with bot-like accounts that tend to inject more unreliable content into the network and to retweet that content. Thus, our methodology applied to this real-world network provides evidence, in an easy and straightforward way, that there is strong interplay between accounts that display higher bot-like activity and users more focused on news from unreliable sources and that this influences the diffusion of this information across the network.

<title>A Communication Multiplexity Approach to Social Capital: On- and Offline Communication and Self-Esteem</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439314552803</url>
<snippet>This study explores the mechanisms by which online social information seeking (i.e., monitoring Facebook friends) relates to social capital. Based on the extant literature, we propose a theoretical framework that includes communication activities across different channels operationalized as offline participation, network structure on social network site operationalized as the number of actual online friends and network diversity, and self-esteem. Results from an online survey (N = 223) found a moderated mediation model in which participation in offline social activities mediated the relationship between social information seeking and self-reported bonding social capital, and self-esteem moderated this mediation. In addition, participation in offline social activities provided an additional channel to accessing bridging social capital. These results provide a theoretical framework for and suggest an approach of communication multiplexity to future research.

<title>Exploring the role of network diversity and resources in relationship to generalized trust in Norway</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.02.002</url>
<snippet>Several studies suggest a positive relationship between social capital and generalized trust. Employing a network understanding of social capital (Lin, 2001), this study questions which aspects of social networks may be linked with generalized trust. It investigates whether the diversity of social networks and the socio-economic status of one's contacts are linked with generalized trust in the Norwegian, egalitarian context. The analyses examine these patterns in relationship to both kin and non-kin contacts. The study employs data from the first Norwegian survey that includes the position generator (PG). The empirical analyses show that extensive social networks are indeed linked to higher levels of generalized trust, but that this relationship is limited to non-kin contacts. Concerning the link between network resources and generalized trust, there is evidence of a more general association with generalized trust that holds when considering both kin and non-kin contacts. These results are a first step in developing a more nuanced discussion of the mechanisms associated with generalized trust and highlight the importance of employing measures that account for the homophily of networks when investigating their relationship to trust.

<title>The spread of innovations in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1004098107</url>
<snippet>Which network structures favor the rapid spread of new ideas, behaviors, or technologies? This question has been studied extensively using epidemic models. Here we consider a complementary point of view and consider scenarios where the individuals' behavior is the result of a strategic choice among competing alternatives. In particular, we study models that are based on the dynamics of coordination games. Classical results in game theory studying this model provide a simple condition for a new action or innovation to become widespread in the network. The present paper characterizes the rate of convergence as a function of the structure of the interaction network. The resulting predictions differ strongly from the ones provided by epidemic models. In particular, it appears that innovation spreads much more slowly on well-connected network structures dominated by long-range links than in low-dimensional ones dominated, for example, by geographic proximity.

<title>Who Talks Religion and What Are the Consequences for Social Ties? Unpacking a Sensitive Discussion Topic in Close Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/socrel/srx069</url>
<snippet>Though religion matters greatly to many U.S. adults, it is widely considered a touchy conversational topic. Understanding how religious issues are talked about with others can elucidate a key interpersonal manifestation of Americans' faith, yet existing research has largely overlooked the phenomena of religious discussion in social networks. This article considers which types of people talk about religion with their close ties, what relational factors underlie religious discussion, and what implications such discussion has for network turnover and stability. Applying multilevel regression methods to ego-centered networks measured in the Portraits of American Life Survey, I find that individual-and relational-level factors each predict the presence of religious discussion within close networks. Longitudinal analyses further reveal that for a large subset of Americans-namely evangelical and mainline Protestants and those involved in a congregation-religious discussion partners are especially likely to remain in the network over the course of 6 years. This association extended beyond other factors that could explain tie persistence, including relational closeness and multiple forms of homophily. Results point to several promising future directions for the study of religion and social networks.

<title>MYTHS AND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES Young people's not so risky use of online communication</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13691180902769873</url>
<snippet>Young people's use of online communication has increasingly become a concern for policy-makers, professionals, and parents. Sharing personal information and grooming or sexual solicitation by online predators have been prominent on the list of dangers. However, little research exists to support fears. This paper reviews the data we do have and shows that, far from being a major problem, the risks from online communication are small-scale and largely focused upon particular groups within the population. Furthermore, they are often misrepresented by safety campaigns and largely within the competencies of young people to manage. It goes on to argue that the over-zealous risk discourse may prevent many benefits of online communication being experienced by young people. Furthermore, the potential for using communication tools as policy vehicles has been largely ignored. The paper concludes by suggesting how risk discourses can be refined to more accurately reflect reality and also how professionals can harness the potential of online communication to benefit young people's lives.

<title>Development and Maintenance of Self-Disclosure on Facebook: The Role of Personality Traits</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2158244019856948</url>
<snippet>This study explored the relationships between Facebook self-disclosure and personality traits in a sample of Italian users. The aim was to analyze the predictive role of Big Five personality traits on different parameters of breadth and depth of self-disclosed behaviors online. Facebook users, aged between 18 and 64 years of age (M-age = 25.3 years, SD = 6.8; N = 958), of which 51&#37; were female, voluntarily completed an online survey assessing personality traits and Facebook self-disclosure. Results at a series of hierarchical regression analyses significantly corroborated the hypotheses that high extroverted and openness people tend to disclose on Facebook a significant amount of personal information, whereas high consciousness and agreeableness users are less inclined to do it. Furthermore, more extroverts and agreeableness people develop less intimacy on Facebook, differently from those with high levels of openness. Results also corroborated the hypothesis of a full mediation of time usage in the relationship between personality factors such as extroversion and conscientiousness with breadth of Facebook self-disclosure. Overall, according to the findings of the current study, personality traits and Facebook self-disclosure become central both as predictive variables for depicting the different profiles of potential addicted and as variables to help educators, teachers, and clinicians to develop training or therapeutic programs aimed at preventing the risk of Internet addiction. Limitations of the study are discussed, and directions for future research are suggested.

<title>Extension 3.0: Managing Agricultural Knowledge Systems in the Network Age</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2014.933496</url>
<snippet>This article develops the idea of "Extension 3.0'' as an approach to agricultural extension that capitalizes on the network structure of local agricultural knowledge systems. Over the last century, agricultural knowledge systems have evolved into networks of widely distributed actors with a diversity of specializations and expertise. Agricultural extension programs need to manage these networks in ways that maximize the synergy between experiential, technical, and social learning. Using empirical research from California farmers, we highlight the structure of these networks within and across contexts, and the importance of boundary-spanning relationships. We provide some initial recommendations about actions needed to realize the goal of Extension 3.0, which is to deliver relevant agricultural knowledge to the right people, at the right time and place.

<title>Messy Arrangements? A Social Networks Perspective on Migrant Labor Brokerage: The Case of Ukrainian Migration to Poland</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.26412/psr220.03</url>
<snippet>This article draws on two studies conducted between 2016 and 2018 on the nature of labor migration from Ukraine to Poland. Using quantitative and qualitative data, it analyses the relationship between social networks and employment agencies. Building on research into migration infrastructure, we question the dichotomy-which also appears in migrants' narratives-between migrant social networks and labor brokers, and offer evidence of overlap and interdependence between the two. Exploring various aspects of labor migration, we look at the role played by the social networks of the actors (both the migrants and the intermediaries) in enhancing migration infrastructure. We show how migrants use their social capital in regard to labor brokers and how the latter, rather than replacing networks, mobilize their network resources and experience to create a trusted transnational service.

<title>Should I use my 'weak' social capital or 'strong' &lt;i&gt;guanxi&lt;/i&gt;? Reviewing and critiquing two theories in the context of Western-Chinese migration</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1440783320925152</url>
<snippet>Social network dynamics are complex in the context of Chinese overseas migration because of the unique dynamics of guanxi, which are distinctly different from 'Western' social capital. The few migration studies comparing guanxi and social capital suggest that the former largely consists 'strong ties', while the latter is comprised of 'weak ties'. However, most apply only a cursory comparison of one network facet. We review core literature in the two fields to contrast what each says about network norms, structures and practices. We find that: (i) guanxi is characterised by dynamics of 'face' and renqing; (ii) guanxi has core and peripheral aspects that grant it bonding and bridging qualities; (iii) weak ties in social capital networks are more beneficial for acquiring non-redundant resources, and for joining civic/voluntary associations; (iv) while strong, face-based guanxi ties better mobilise valuable resources, these ties are rarely transformed into social capital.

<title>Perturbation Centrality and Turbine: A Novel Centrality Measure Obtained Using a Versatile Network Dynamics Tool</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0078059</url>
<snippet>Analysis of network dynamics became a focal point to understand and predict changes of complex systems. Here we introduce Turbine, a generic framework enabling fast simulation of any algorithmically definable dynamics on very large networks. Using a perturbation transmission model inspired by communicating vessels, we define a novel centrality measure: perturbation centrality. Hubs and inter-modular nodes proved to be highly efficient in perturbation propagation. High perturbation centrality nodes of the Met-tRNA synthetase protein structure network were identified as amino acids involved in intra-protein communication by earlier studies. Changes in perturbation centralities of yeast interactome nodes upon various stresses well recapitulated the functional changes of stressed yeast cells. The novelty and usefulness of perturbation centrality was validated in several other model, biological and social networks. The Turbine software and the perturbation centrality measure may provide a large variety of novel options to assess signaling, drug action, environmental and social interventions.

<title>Estimating Policy Positions Using Social Network Data: Cross-Validating Position Estimates of Political Parties and Individual Legislators in the Polish Parliament</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439315602662</url>
<snippet>Social network site (SNS) data provide scholars with a plethora of new opportunities for studying public opinion and forecasting electoral outcomes. While these are certainly among the most promising big data applications in political science research, a series of pioneering studies have started to uncover the vast potential of such data to estimate the policy positions of political actors. Adding to this emerging strand in the scholarly literature, the present article explores the validity of (individual) policy positions derived from the social network structure of the microblogging platform Twitter. At the aggregate party level, cross-validation with external data sources suggests that SNS data provide valid policy position estimates. In contrast, the empirical analysis reveals only a moderate connection between individual policy positions retrieved from the social network structure and those retrieved from members of parliament individual voting record. These results thus highlight the potential as well as important limitations of SNS data in indicating the policy positions of political parties and individual legislators.

<title>Tweets and Quacks: Network and Content Analyses of Providers of Non-Science-Based Anticancer Treatments and Their Supporters on Twitter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440211003084</url>
<snippet>Despite the consensus in the medical discipline that certain treatments lack scientific evidence and are worthless if not potentially dangerous, the promotion and selling of fake cures advertised as safe and effective has long plagued health care systems, praying on vulnerable patients and their loved ones. The web and social media are now playing a fundamental role in the propagation of non-science-based treatments and fraudulent medical claims, and in the rise of false health and lifestyle experts. This study combines criminological and computer science expertise to explore and critically analyze the Twitter presence of providers of non-science-based anticancer treatments and their active supporters in the English-speaking online community to investigate their structural relationships and to analyze the characteristics of the most popular actors. The features of the social network observed indicate that there is not a stable community of promoters and supporters of non-science-based medical treatments in the Twittersphere, suggesting the lack of a defined subculture and the presence of transient collectives rather than identifiable groups. Nonetheless, it is possible to observe dynamic conversational networks clustering around popular actors, tweets, and themes, prompting avenues for further research.

<title>NET AND JET The Internet use, travel and social networks of Chinese Canadian entrepreneurs</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13691180902858080</url>
<snippet>How does the connectivity afforded by new communication and transportation technologies affect entrepreneurs' geographic and social closeness to each other? Using qualitative and quantitative evidence we analyse how Chinese Canadian entrepreneurs combine the Internet and airplane travel in their business activities. Our results show that the use of new communication and transportation technologies are positively related to the creation and maintenance of 'glocalized' networks, a function of both local embeddedness and global outreach. We find that online interaction cannot replace face-to-face interaction; travel abroad is crucial for adding a human touch to glocalized networks. Moreover, while technologies help to liberate communication from being local, Internet use and travel have limited impact on the ethnic diversity of the entrepreneurs' social networks.

<title>Minding the Gender Gap: Social Network and Internet Correlates of Business Performance Among Chinese Immigrant Entrepreneurs</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764215580609</url>
<snippet>Existing studies have been inconclusive on whether and the extent to which gendered social networks contribute to the gender gap in business performance. Drawing on a random sample of Chinese Canadian entrepreneurs, this research examines the nexus of social networks, Internet use, and the gender gap in business performance. Results reveal a marked gender difference in firm size, which becomes narrowed after social networks, voluntary association participation, Internet use, and business characteristics are controlled. More important, network composition and structural position have different implications for men and women entrepreneurs. Men are more effective in converting relational advantages into business advantages. Interaction effects suggest that kin homophily hurts women's business performance but not men's. Yet, women gain more from participating in transnational entrepreneurship.

<title>Monitoring Network Changes in Social Media</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2021.2016425</url>
<snippet>Econometricians are increasingly working with high-dimensional networks and their dynamics. Econometricians, however, are often confronted with unforeseen changes in network dynamics. In this article, we develop a method and the corresponding algorithm for monitoring changes in dynamic networks. We characterize two types of changes, edge-initiated and node-initiated, to feature the complexity of networks. The proposed approach accounts for three potential challenges in the analysis of networks. First, networks are high-dimensional objects causing the standard statistical tools to suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Second, any potential changes in social networks are likely driven by a few nodes or edges in the network. Third, in many dynamic network applications such as monitoring network connectedness or its centrality, it will be more practically applicable to detect the change in an online fashion than the offline version. The proposed detection method at each time point projects the entire network onto a low-dimensional vector by taking the sparsity into account, then sequentially detects the change by comparing consecutive estimates of the optimal projection direction. As long as the change is sizeable and persistent, the projected vectors will converge to the optimal one, leading to a jump in the sine angle distance between them. A change is therefore declared. Strong theoretical guarantees on both the false alarm rate and detection delays are derived in a sub-Gaussian setting, even under spatial and temporal dependence in the data stream. Numerical studies and an application to the social media messages network support the effectiveness of our method.

<snippet>This paper contributes to the empirical identification of the structural positions in network through an exploration of the interactions between R&amp;D activities (patents) and technological areas of patents (technological classifications). Affiliation network analysis was conducted to study the affiliation between patents and technological classifications. We identified some key patents and explored the differentiated positions of the core and periphery. The results of network analysis was further verified by statistical analysis. We found that the impacts of the centralities in position were significant. Technological implications and foresights are discussed in the conclusion.

<title>The nature of ICT in technology convergence: A knowledge-based network analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254424</url>
<snippet>This study aims to understand the nature of information and communication technology in technology convergence. We form a knowledge network by applying social network theories to Korean patent data collected from the European Patent Organization. A knowledge network consists of nodes representing technology sectors identified by their International Patent Classification codes and edges that link International Patent Classification codes when they appear concurrently in a patent. We test the proposed hypotheses using four indices (degree centrality, E-I index, entropy index, and clustering coefficient). The results show that information and communication technology is easily attached but tends to converge with similar technology and has the greatest influence on technology convergence over other technologies. This study is expected to help practitioners and policymakers understand the structure and interaction mechanisms of technology from a systematic perspective and improve national-level technology policies.

<title>Identifying and quantifying potential super-spreaders in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51153-5</url>
<snippet>Quantifying the nodal spreading abilities and identifying the potential influential spreaders has been one of the most engaging topics recently, which is essential and beneficial to facilitate information flow and ensure the stabilization operations of social networks. However, most of the existing algorithms just consider a fundamental quantification through combining a certain attribute of the nodes to measure the nodes' importance. Moreover, reaching a balance between the accuracy and the simplicity of these algorithms is difficult. In order to accurately identify the potential super-spreaders, the CumulativeRank algorithm is proposed in the present study. This algorithm combines the local and global performances of nodes for measuring the nodal spreading abilities. In local performances, the proposed algorithm considers both the direct influence from the node's neighbourhoods and the indirect influence from the nearest and the next nearest neighbours. On the other hand, in the global performances, the concept of the tenacity is introduced to assess the node's prominent position in maintaining the network connectivity. Extensive experiments carried out with the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model on real-world social networks demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the comparison of the proposed algorithm with the existing well-known algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm has lower time complexity and can be applicable to large-scale networks.

<title>Spatial heterogeneity can lead to substantial local variations in COVID-19 timing and severity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011656117</url>
<snippet>Standard epidemiological models for COVID-19 employ variants of compartment (SIR or susceptible-infectious-recovered) models at local scales, implicitly assuming spatially uniform local mixing. Here, we examine the effect of employing more geographically detailed diffusion models based on known spatial features of interpersonal networks, most particularly the presence of a long-tailed but monotone decline in the probability of interaction with distance, on disease diffusion. Based on simulations of unrestricted COVID-19 diffusion in 19 US cities, we conclude that heterogeneity in population distribution can have large impacts on local pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate behavior at larger scales mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts observed include severe local outbreaks with long lag time relative to the aggregate infection curve, and the presence of numerous areas whose disease trajectories correlate poorly with those of neighboring areas. A simple catchment model for hospital demand illustrates potential implications for health care utilization, with substantial disparities in the timing and extremity of impacts even without distancing interventions. Likewise, analysis of social exposure to others who are morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic can appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk assessment and compliance with mitigation measures. These results demonstrate the potential for spatial network structure to generate highly nonuniform diffusion behavior even at the scale of cities, and suggest the importance of incorporating such structure when designing models to inform health care planning, predict community outcomes, or identify potential disparities.

<title>The tie effect on information dissemination: the spread of a commercial rumor in Hong Kong</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-8733(01)00050-8</url>
<snippet>The ability to acquire information has been considered a crucial factor facilitating instrumental actions, such as job search and organizational innovation. Previous social network studies tend to treat the characteristics of social ties through which information is acquired as causes that may affect instrumental outcomes. However, little research has directly examined the spread of information via social ties and the tie effect on information dissemination. Using telephone survey data collected after the outbreak of an extensive commercial rumor in Hong Kong, the present paper investigates the characteristics of social ties through which the information is spread and the tie effect on information dissemination. Results show that while mass media, particularly television, serves as a major channel of information flow, social ties are also widely used. Individuals tend to share information with strong ties, or people with whom they perceive to have good relations. However, information transmitted via kin ties tends to arrive at the respondent faster than via nonkin ties or other communication channels. Implications of the findings are discussed.

<snippet>The aim of the paper is to propose a way of assessing tourist partnerships using Social Network Analysis (SNA). The partnership structure chosen for this assessment was the `Wisla Tourist Organization' (WTO) - a Destination Marketing Organization operating in the south of Poland. Collaboration assessment was based on discovering if, and to what extent new types of relationships between WTO members exist - and how big a part of the network structure they cover. It was assumed that the higher the extent of partnership relations in the WTO based on direct relations between WTO's members including: business cooperation, communication, knowledge, trust, mutual understanding, dialogue, benefits from cooperation, and perceived fulfilled expectations, the higher the level of collaboration evaluation.

<title>Diffusion in small worlds with homophily and social reinforcement: A theoretical model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.05.004</url>
<snippet>We introduce homophily in a percolation model of word-of-mouth diffusion in social networks by reorganizing the nodes according to similarity in preferences for adoption of an innovation. Such preferences are described by a "minimum utility requirement"for an agent to adopt. We show that homophily removes the non-linear relation between preferences and diffusion in the standard percolation model with a high diffusion regime ("hit") and a low diffusion regime ("flop"). Instead, in a model with perfect homophily, the final diffusion scales linearly with individual preferences: all agents who are willing to adopt, do adopt the innovation. We also investigate the combined effect of homophily and social reinforcement in diffusion. Results indicate that social reinforcement renders clustered networks more efficient in terms of diffusion size for network with strong homophily, while the opposite is true for networks without homophily. The simple structure of our model allows to disentangle the effect of social influence, homophily and the network structure on diffusion. However, the controllability of the theoretical structure comes at the expenses of the realism of the model. For this, we discuss possible extensions and empirical applications.

<title>Social learning and partisan bias in the interpretation of climate trends</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1722664115</url>
<snippet>Vital scientific communications are frequently misinterpreted by the lay public as a result of motivated reasoning, where people misconstrue data to fit their political and psychological biases. In the case of climate change, some people have been found to systematically misinterpret climate data in ways that conflict with the intended message of climate scientists. While prior studies have attempted to reduce motivated reasoning through bipartisan communication networks, these networks have also been found to exacerbate bias. Popular theories hold that bipartisan networks amplify bias by exposing people to opposing beliefs. These theories are in tension with collective intelligence research, which shows that exchanging beliefs in social networks can facilitate social learning, thereby improving individual and group judgments. However, prior experiments in collective intelligence have relied almost exclusively on neutral questions that do not engage motivated reasoning. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we conducted an online experiment to test how bipartisan social networks can influence subjects' interpretation of climate communications from NASA. Here, we show that exposure to opposing beliefs in structured bipartisan social networks substantially improved the accuracy of judgments among both conservatives and liberals, eliminating belief polarization. However, we also find that social learning can be reduced, and belief polarization maintained, as a result of partisan priming. We find that increasing the salience of partisanship during communication, both through exposure to the logos of political parties and through exposure to the political identities of network peers, can significantly reduce social learning.

<title>Impact of Repeated Exposures on Information Spreading in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140556</url>
<snippet>Clustered structure of social networks provides the chances of repeated exposures to carriers with similar information. It is commonly believed that the impact of repeated exposures on the spreading of information is nontrivial. Does this effect increase the probability that an individual forwards a message in social networks? If so, to what extent does this effect influence people's decisions on whether or not to spread information? Based on a large-scale microblogging data set, which logs the message spreading processes and users' forwarding activities, we conduct a data-driven analysis to explore the answer to the above questions. The results show that an overwhelming majority of message samples are more probable to be forwarded under repeated exposures, compared to those under only a single exposure. For those message samples that cover various topics, we observe a relatively fixed, topic-independent multiplier of the willingness of spreading when repeated exposures occur, regardless of the differences in network structure. We believe that this finding reflects average people's intrinsic psychological gain under repeated stimuli. Hence, it makes sense that the gain is associated with personal response behavior, rather than network structure. Moreover, we find that the gain is robust against the change of message popularity. This finding supports that there exists a relatively fixed gain brought by repeated exposures. Based on the above findings, we propose a parsimonious model to predict the saturated numbers of forwarding activities of messages. Our work could contribute to better understandings of behavioral psychology and social media analytics.

<title>"Gateway Conspiracy": Distrust of the COVID-19 Pandemic as a Gateway to Conspiracy Theories</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.5477/cis/reis.188.145-164</url>
<snippet>The article examines how distrust regarding the COVID-19 pandemic has served as a catalyst for the diffusion of conspiracy theories. It discusses the nature of conspiracy theories, their relationship with institutional distrust, and their representation in the social media. The methodology used is based on the analysis of hashtags from over one million tweets to determine if certain theories act as "gateways" to others. The findings suggest that logical ties exist between distinct conspiracy theories, influenced by distrust towards specific institutions and amplified by the COVID-19 crisis. It is concluded that the combination of conspiracy theories is not random, but rather, it follows an internal logic that is based on distrust, since these theories are interconnected in an internally coherent way within the context of the pandemic.

<title>Online searches to evaluate misinformation can increase its perceived veracity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06883-y</url>
<snippet>Considerable scholarly attention has been paid to understanding belief in online misinformation1,2, with a particular focus on social networks. However, the dominant role of search engines in the information environment remains underexplored, even though the use of online search to evaluate the veracity of information is a central component of media literacy interventions3-5. Although conventional wisdom suggests that searching online when evaluating misinformation would reduce belief in it, there is little empirical evidence to evaluate this claim. Here, across five experiments, we present consistent evidence that online search to evaluate the truthfulness of false news articles actually increases the probability of believing them. To shed light on this relationship, we combine survey data with digital trace data collected using a custom browser extension. We find that the search effect is concentrated among individuals for whom search engines return lower-quality information. Our results indicate that those who search online to evaluate misinformation risk falling into data voids, or informational spaces in which there is corroborating evidence from low-quality sources. We also find consistent evidence that searching online to evaluate news increases belief in true news from low-quality sources, but inconsistent evidence that it increases belief in true news from mainstream sources. Our findings highlight the need for media literacy programmes to ground their recommendations in empirically tested strategies and for search engines to invest in solutions to the challenges identified here. Searching online to evaluate the truthfulness of false news articles increases the probability of believing the false news articles.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440231184860</url>
<snippet>Online social networking sites are places where users spend a lot of their time and leave a huge number of narratives. In the virtual world of Facebook, moving in a space is limited to only a slight hand movement. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the level of Facebook intrusion, time perspective, and the contents of Facebook narratives. The participants were 83 Polish Facebook users, aged 18 to 62 years. We used the Facebook Intrusion Questionnaire, the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory, and the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program. The results suggest that Facebook intrusion is connected with the low future perspective of Facebook users. Moreover, the stronger the Facebook intrusion, the more swear words in Facebook narratives. There were significant positive relationships between a present fatalistic time perspective and words expressing aggression in Facebook narratives. The results were interpreted in the context of the theory of embodied cognition.

<title>Prediction of employment and unemployment rates from Twitter daily rhythms in the US</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0112-x</url>
<snippet>By modeling macro-economical indicators using digital traces of human activities on mobile or social networks, we can provide important insights to processes previously assessed via paper-based surveys or polls only. We collected aggregated workday activity timelines of US counties from the normalized number of messages sent in each hour on the online social network Twitter. In this paper, we show how county employment and unemployment statistics are encoded in the daily rhythm of people by decomposing the activity timelines into a linear combination of two dominant patterns. The mixing ratio of these patterns defines a measure for each county, that correlates significantly with employment (0.46 +/- 0.02) and unemployment rates (-0.34 +/- 0.02). Thus, the two dominant activity patterns can be linked to rhythms signaling presence or lack of regular working hours of individuals. The analysis could provide policy makers a better insight into the processes governing employment, where problems could not only be identified based on the number of officially registered unemployed, but also on the basis of the digital footprints people leave on different platforms.

<title>Do rich teens get richer? Facebook use and the link between offline and online social capital among Palestinian youth in Israel</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1261168</url>
<snippet>Studies have shown that using social networking sites contributes to social capital. This study investigated the association between specific features of Facebook and online social capital. Two contrasting hypothesis were tested. The first posits that the rich get richer, meaning that the creation of social capital online reflects the stock of offline resources already available. In contrast, the compensation hypothesis argues that disadvantaged ethnic minorities are more likely to use social media to compensate for their lack of social capital offline. We tested these two theories among a representative sample of Palestinian teenagers (N = 567). While we found no gender differences in the use of Facebook's features, our results highlight the positive correlation between the use of active and passive communication features and perceived social capital online. Moreover, the results support the rich-getricher model; in that, even among this socially disadvantaged group, the youngsters who already had a store of social capital offline benefitted more from using Facebook.

<title>A minimalistic model of bias, polarization and misinformation in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62085-w</url>
<snippet>Online social networks provide users with unprecedented opportunities to engage with diverse opinions. At the same time, they enable confirmation bias on large scales by empowering individuals to self-select narratives they want to be exposed to. A precise understanding of such tradeoffs is still largely missing. We introduce a social learning model where most participants in a network update their beliefs unbiasedly based on new information, while a minority of participants reject information that is incongruent with their preexisting beliefs. This simple mechanism generates permanent opinion polarization and cascade dynamics, and accounts for the aforementioned tradeoff between confirmation bias and social connectivity through analytic results. We investigate the model's predictions empirically using US county-level data on the impact of Internet access on the formation of beliefs about global warming. We conclude by discussing policy implications of our model, highlighting the downsides of debunking and suggesting alternative strategies to contrast misinformation.

<snippet>In this paper we investigate shifts in Twitter network topology resulting from the type of information being shared. We identified communities matching areas of agricultural expertise and measured the core-periphery centralization of network formations resulting from users sharing generic versus specialized information. We found that centralization increases when specialized information is shared and that the network adopts decentralized formations as conversations become more generic. The results are consistent with classical diffusion models positing that specialized information comes with greater centralization, but they also show that users favor decentralized formations, which can foster community cohesion, when spreading specialized information is secondary.

<title>Effect of Overconfidence on Product Diffusion in Online Social Networks: A Multiagent Simulation Based on Evolutionary Game and Overconfidence Theory</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/1516419</url>
<snippet>The rapid development of online social media has significantly promoted product diffusion in online social networks (PDOSN). However, prior studies focusing on irrational behavior, such as overconfidence, in PDOSN are scarce. To investigate the effect of overconfidence on PDOSN, this study combined overconfidence and an evolutionary game to conduct a multiagent simulation on PDOSN. This combined method provided an effective reference to examine product diffusion in the context of irrational behavior. After careful consideration, this study identified three overconfidence scenarios, benefit, cost, and benefit and cost overconfidence, developed a multiagent simulation model for PDOSN using various overconfidence scenarios, and conducted a comparison with real-world cases to validate the model's feasibility. The findings indicated that adoption benefits and betrayal penalties had a positive effect on the results in all models, while adoption costs had the opposite effect. When benefit and cost overconfidence occurred simultaneously, benefit overconfidence offset the negative effect of cost overconfidence. Moderate connectivity, a large number of core nodes, and high reconnection probability fully promoted product diffusion. Benefit overconfidence and cost overconfidence had a significant impact on the results in different networks. As such, this study combined psychological theory with simulation methods, providing insights for future research on product diffusion.

<title>Campaign-Related Social Networking and the Political Participation of College Students</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439312455474</url>
<snippet>College students politically participate through traditional mechanisms at lower rates than their elders. Yet, members of this group may participate by other means, like friending candidates and joining political groups through social networking websites. We argue that these online activities serve as a meaningful form of civic engagement by broadening who participates and encouraging other forms of participation. Using a survey of randomly chosen undergraduates at a large Midwestern university, we discover that important distinctions exist between those who friend or join these online social networks and those who participate in more traditional off-line political activities. While interest in politics is a precursor to off-line engagement, it does not predict friending or joining an online social network that is political in nature. However, friending candidates or joining such networks appears to mobilize college students to engage in other forms of political participation.

<title>Exposure to opposing views on social media can increase political polarization</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1804840115</url>
<snippet>There is mounting concern that social media sites contribute to political polarization by creating "echo chambers" that insulate people from opposing views about current events. We surveyed a large sample of Democrats and Republicans who visit Twitter at least three times each week about a range of social policy issues. One week later, we randomly assigned respondents to a treatment condition in which they were offered financial incentives to follow a Twitter bot for 1 month that exposed them to messages from those with opposing political ideologies (e.g., elected officials, opinion leaders, media organizations, and nonprofit groups). Respondents were resurveyed at the end of the month to measure the effect of this treatment, and at regular intervals throughout the study period to monitor treatment compliance. We find that Republicans who followed a liberal Twitter bot became substantially more conservative posttreatment. Democrats exhibited slight increases in liberal attitudes after following a conservative Twitter bot, although these effects are not statistically significant. Notwithstanding important limitations of our study, these findings have significant implications for the interdisciplinary literature on political polarization and the emerging field of computational social science.

<title>Networks and geography: Modelling community network structures as the outcome of both spatial and network processes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2010.12.001</url>
<snippet>This paper focuses on how to extend the exponential random graph models to take into account the geographical embeddedness of individuals in modelling social networks. We develop a hierarchical set of nested models for spatially embedded social networks, in which, following Butts (2002), an interaction function between tie probability and Euclidean distance between nodes is introduced. The models are illustrated by an empirical example from a study of the role of social networks in understanding spatial clustering in unemployment in Australia. The analysis suggests that a spatial effect cannot solely explain the emergence of organised network structure and it is necessary to include both spatial and endogenous network effects in the model.

<title>Multi-criteria decision support for planning and evaluation of performance of viral marketing campaigns in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209372</url>
<snippet>The current marketing landscape, apart from conventional approaches, consists of campaigns designed especially for launching information diffusion processes within online networks. Associated research is focused on information propagation models, campaign initialization strategies and factors affecting campaign dynamics. In terms of algorithms and performance evaluation, the final coverage represented by the fraction of activated nodes within a target network is usually used. It is not necessarily consistent with the real marketing campaigns using various characteristics and parameters related to coverage, costs, behavioral patterns and time factors for overall evaluation. This paper presents assumptions for a decision support system for multi-criteria campaign planning and evaluation with inputs from agent-based simulations. The results, which are delivered from a simulation model based on synthetic networks in a form of decision scenarios, are verified within a real network. Last, but not least, the study proposes a multi-objective campaign evaluation framework with several campaign evaluation metrics integrated. The results showed that the recommendations generated with the use of synthetic networks applied to real networks delivered results according to the decision makers' expectation in terms of the used evaluation criteria. Apart from practical applications, the proposed multi-objective approach creates new evaluation possibilities for theoretical studies focused on information spreading processes within complex networks.

<title>Knowledge through social networks: Accuracy, error, and polarisation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0294815</url>
<snippet>This paper examines the fundamental problem of testimony. Much of what we believe to know we know in good part, or even entirely, through the testimony of others. The problem with testimony is that we often have very little on which to base estimates of the accuracy of our sources. Simulations with otherwise optimal agents examine the impact of this for the accuracy of our beliefs about the world. It is demonstrated both where social networks of information dissemination help and where they hinder. Most importantly, it is shown that both social networks and a common strategy for gauging the accuracy of our sources give rise to polarisation even for entirely accuracy motivated agents. Crucially these two factors interact, amplifying one another's negative consequences, and this side effect of communication in a social network increases with network size. This suggests a new causal mechanism by which social media may have fostered the increase in polarisation currently observed in many parts of the world.

<title>The network structure of trust in the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14616696.2020.1834597</url>
<snippet>Trust is considered an essential part of a democratic society. That is why it is important to pay attention to it, especially in times of crisis. Some recent studies have introduced a new approach to examining attitudes and trust using social network analysis. The aim of our study is to examine the relationship between different types of trust during the coronavirus crisis. Using a sample representative of the adult population of the Czech Republic, our text discusses what the network structure of trust is like during the current pandemic. We find that the institutions or actors that are directly involved in resolving the crisis, such as security institutions and medical professionals, are located at the centre of the network of trust.

<title>Effects of Trust, Public Engagement, Conflict, and Social Networks on Satisfaction with Ecological Restoration</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2024.2335388</url>
<snippet>River restoration is one of the most common, expensive, and environmentally influential forms of restoration, but has little post-restoration assessment of social success. In this study, we use social network theory and analysis (SNA), an emerging approach for understanding social dynamics in restoration projects, to examine the social connections, perceptions of project success, and attitudes of stakeholders involved in a river restoration project. We find that positive and negative social network ties have asymmetrical effects on stakeholders' attitudes and satisfaction with project outcomes. Trust ties positively influence perceptions of public engagement, while avoidance ties negatively influence satisfaction. Trust in leaders positively influences satisfaction and both public engagement and perceived conflict influence the development of that trust. We contribute to the growing body of research using SNA in natural resource contexts through quantitative tests of social networks' effects on stakeholder satisfaction with project outcomes.

<title>Quantifying the propagation of distress and mental disorders in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-23260-2</url>
<snippet>Heterogeneity of human beings leads to think and react differently to social phenomena. Awareness and homophily drive people to weigh interactions in social multiplex networks, influencing a potential contagion effect. To quantify the impact of heterogeneity on spreading dynamics, we propose a model of coevolution of social contagion and awareness, through the introduction of statistical estimators, in a weighted multiplex network. Multiplexity of networked individuals may trigger propagation enough to produce effects among vulnerable subjects experiencing distress, mental disorder, which represent some of the strongest predictors of suicidal behaviours. The exposure to suicide is emotionally harmful, since talking about it may give support or inadvertently promote it. To disclose the complex effect of the overlapping awareness on suicidal ideation spreading among disordered people, we also introduce a data-driven approach by integrating different types of data. Our modelling approach unveils the relationship between distress and mental disorders propagation and suicidal ideation spreading, shedding light on the role of awareness in a social network for suicide prevention. The proposed model is able to quantify the impact of overlapping awareness on suicidal ideation spreading and our findings demonstrate that it plays a dual role on contagion, either reinforcing or delaying the contagion outbreak.

<title>Triangulating the Self: Identity Processes in a Connected Era</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/symb.123</url>
<snippet>The increasing prevalence of digital social technologies in everyday life affects processes of self and identity in theoretically and empirically interesting ways. Based on face-to-face interviews (N=17) and synchronous text-based exchanges (N=32) from a Facebook-based population, I examine the conditions of identity negotiation in a networked era, and explore how social actors strike a presentational balance between ideal and authentic. I identify three key interaction conditions: fluidity between digital and physical, expectations of accuracy, and overlapping social networks. I argue that social actors accomplish the ideal-authentic balance through self-triangulation, presenting a coherent image in multiple arenas and through multiple media. I differentiate between two degrees of triangulation: networked logic and preemptive action.

<title>The voice of few, the opinions of many: evidence of social biases in Twitter COVID-19 fake news sharing</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.220716</url>
<snippet>Online platforms play a relevant role in the creation and diffusion of false or misleading news. Concerningly, the COVID-19 pandemic is shaping a communication network which reflects the emergence of collective attention towards a topic that rapidly gained universal interest. Here, we characterize the dynamics of this network on Twitter, analysing how unreliable content distributes among its users. We find that a minority of accounts is responsible for the majority of the misinformation circulating online, and identify two categories of users: a few active ones, playing the role of 'creators', and a majority playing the role of 'consumers'. The relative proportion of these groups (approx. 14&#37; creators-86&#37; consumers) appears stable over time: consumers are mostly exposed to the opinions of a vocal minority of creators (which are the origin of 82&#37; of fake content in our data), that could be mistakenly understood as representative of the majority of users. The corresponding pressure from a perceived majority is identified as a potential driver of the ongoing COVID-19 infodemic.

<title>Wild animals suppress the spread of socially transmitted misinformation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2215428120</url>
<snippet>Understanding the mechanisms by which information and misinformation spread through groups of individual actors is essential to the prediction of phenomena ranging from coordinated group behaviors to misinformation epidemics. Transmission of information through groups depends on the rules that individuals use to transform the perceived actions of others into their own behaviors. Because it is often not possible to directly infer decision-making strategies in situ, most studies of behavioral spread assume that individuals make decisions by pooling or averaging the actions or behavioral states of neighbors. However, whether individuals may instead adopt more sophisticated strategies that exploit socially transmitted information, while remaining robust to misinformation, is unknown. Here, we study the relationship between individual decision-making and misinformation spread in groups of wild coral reef fish, where misinformation occurs in the form of false alarms that can spread contagiously through groups. Using automated visual field reconstruction of wild animals, we infer the precise sequences of socially transmitted visual stimuli perceived by individuals during decision-making. Our analysis reveals a feature of decision-making essential for controlling misinformation spread: dynamic adjustments in sensitivity to socially transmitted cues. This form of dynamic gain control can be achieved by a simple and biologically widespread decision-making circuit, and it renders individual behavior robust to natural fluctuations in misinformation exposure.

<title>A behavior genetic analysis of the tendency for youth to associate according to GPA</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.01.001</url>
<snippet>Behavior genetic research has revealed that many "environmental" variables are partially influenced by genetic factors. Known as gene-environment correlation (rGE), this line of scholarship provides insight on how and why individuals select into certain environments. Juxtaposing this body of evidence with research on peer group homophily-the tendency for peers to resemble one another on certain traits such as academic ability-raised two research hypotheses: (1) youth will associate with peers who receive grades similar to themselves (i.e., homophily for GPA); and (2) a portion of the variance in peer group GPA (i.e., the peer network average GPA) will be explained by individuals' genetic self-selection into the peer group (rGE). The results supported both hypotheses by showing a strong predictive relationship between the target individual's GPA and that of his/her peers and by revealing that 72&#37; of the variance in peer group GPA was explained by genetic influences.

<title>No echo in the chambers of political interactions on Reddit</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-81531-x</url>
<snippet>Echo chambers in online social networks, whereby users' beliefs are reinforced by interactions with like-minded peers and insulation from others' points of view, have been decried as a cause of political polarization. Here, we investigate their role in the debate around the 2016 US elections on Reddit, a fundamental platform for the success of Donald Trump. We identify Trump vs Clinton supporters and reconstruct their political interaction network. We observe a preference for cross-cutting political interactions between the two communities rather than within-group interactions, thus contradicting the echo chamber narrative. Furthermore, these interactions are asymmetrical: Clinton supporters are particularly eager to answer comments by Trump supporters. Beside asymmetric heterophily, users show assortative behavior for activity, and disassortative, asymmetric behavior for popularity. Our findings are tested against a null model of random interactions, by using two different approaches: a network rewiring which preserves the activity of nodes, and a logit regression which takes into account possible confounding factors. Finally, we explore possible socio-demographic implications. Users show a tendency for geographical homophily and a small positive correlation between cross-interactions and voter abstention. Our findings shed light on public opinion formation on social media, calling for a better understanding of the social dynamics at play in this context.

<title>Formation of raiding parties for intergroup violence is mediated by social network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1610961113</url>
<snippet>Intergroup violence is common among humans worldwide. To assess how within-group social dynamics contribute to risky, between-group conflict, we conducted a 3-y longitudinal study of the formation of raiding parties among the Nyangatom, a group of East African nomadic pastoralists currently engaged in small-scale warfare. We also mapped the social network structure of potential male raiders. Here, we show that the initiation of raids depends on the presence of specific leaders who tend to participate in many raids, to have more friends, and to occupy more central positions in the network. However, despite the different structural position of raid leaders, raid participants are recruited from the whole population, not just from the direct friends of leaders. An individual's decision to participate in a raid is strongly associated with the individual's social network position in relation to other participants. Moreover, non-leaders have a larger total impact on raid participation than leaders, despite leaders' greater connectivity. Thus, we find that leaders matter more for raid initiation than participant mobilization. Social networks may play a role in supporting risky collective action, amplify the emergence of raiding parties, and hence facilitate intergroup violence in small-scale societies.

<title>The rich get richer: Extroverts' social capital on twitter</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101551</url>
<snippet>Previous studies have associated social capital to one's social networks. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have looked at the interplay between one's personality, twitter activity, and number of twitter followers; with his or her social capital. Therefore, this research paper examined a correlation between these dimensions, to see if potentially people with different personalities have different benefits from their Twitter based activity. Social capital was measured by a survey (N = 218), and number of Twitter followings was analyzed based on the social ties of participants on Twitter (these data were collected using a script developed for this purpose). Our findings indicate that there is a correlation between the frequency of Twitter use, extroversion and perceived online bridging social capital of users. In other words, extroverts gain more online social capital through their online followings (when compared to their introvert counterparts); when introverts and extroverts have the same network size, extroverts gain more social capital. Furthermore, when introverts and extroverts have the same network size and also use Twitter more frequently, extroverts gain more social capital. The use of online social networking sites is significant in terms of social capital benefits. Furthermore, our results support the 'Rich get Richer' model by showing that people who are social offline benefit from their sociability also online.

<title>OMGs! Offline-based movement organizations, online-based movement organizations and network mobilization: a case study of political bloggers in Singapore</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2013.808256</url>
<snippet>The proliferation of Internet technologies has paved the way for technology adoption among marginalized communities and individuals for advancing varied political and civic agendas. Social movement scholars advocate that technology is becoming an integral component of the social movement repertoire, and building on their work, Internet scholars have examined the evolving nature of movement organizations and formal networks. Adopting resource mobilization and social network theories as the conceptual framework, this study examines political bloggers' social networks. Through 41 in-depth interviews and 76 survey responses, we collected data on political bloggers' activism participation and their organizational affiliations. Social networking patterns are linked to different organizational affiliation types - membership with formal organizations rooted in the offline context; membership with issue-based online organizations which assume a temporal nature and non-membership. Focusing on the dialectics between offline and online, permanence and temporality, the study showed that activists who belonged to offline-based organizations experienced greater social influence and collectiveness with one another. However, activist bloggers who belonged to online-based groups shared strong ties and sustained communication even after a campaign ended. More significantly, the findings show that online movement groups, although temporal in nature, foster what Sunstein [(2009). Republic.com 2.0 (pp. 19-45). Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press] termed as 'enclave deliberation', attributed to the inclusive and open networks of online-based movement organizations.

<title>Dissecting the infodemic: An in-depth analysis of COVID-19 misinformation detection on X (formerly Twitter) utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e37760</url>
<snippet>The alarming growth of misinformation on social media has become a global concern as it influences public opinions and compromises social, political, and public health development. The proliferation of deceptive information has resulted in widespread confusion, societal disturbances, and significant consequences for matters pertaining to health. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a substantial surge in the dissemination of inaccurate or deceptive information via social media platforms, particularly X (formerly known as Twitter), resulting in the phenomenon commonly referred to as an "Infodemic". This review paper examines a grand selection of 600 articles published in the past five years and focuses on conducting a thorough analysis of 87 studies that investigate the detection of fake news connected to COVID-19 on Twitter. In addition, this research explores the algorithmic techniques and methodologies used to investigate the individuals responsible for disseminating this type of fake news. A summary of common datasets, along with their fundamental qualities, for detecting fake news has been included as well. For the purpose of identifying fake news, the behavioral pattern of the misinformation spreaders, and their community analysis, we have performed an in-depth examination of the most recent literature that the researchers have worked with and recommended. Our key findings can be summarized in a few points: (a) around 80&#37; of fake news detection-related papers have utilized Deep Neural Networks-based techniques for better performance achievement, although the proposed models suffer from overfitting, vanishing gradients, and higher prediction time problems, (b) around 60&#37; of the disseminator related analysis papers focus on identifying dominant spreaders and their communities utilizing graph modeling although there is not much work done in this domain, and finally,

<title>Knowledge diffusion of dynamical network in terms of interaction frequency</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-11057-8</url>
<snippet>In this paper, we present a knowledge diffusion (SKD) model for dynamic networks by taking into account the interaction frequency which always used to measure the social closeness. A set of agents, which are initially interconnected to form a random network, either exchange knowledge with their neighbors or move toward a new location through an edge-rewiring procedure. The activity of knowledge exchange between agents is determined by a knowledge transfer rule that the target node would preferentially select one neighbor node to transfer knowledge with probability p according to their interaction frequency instead of the knowledge distance, otherwise, the target node would build a new link with its second-order neighbor preferentially or select one node in the system randomly with probability 1 - p. The simulation results show that, comparing with the Null model defined by the random selection mechanism and the traditional knowledge diffusion (TKD) model driven by knowledge distance, the knowledge would spread more fast based on SKD driven by interaction frequency. In particular, the network structure of SKD would evolve as an assortative one, which is a fundamental feature of social networks. This work would be helpful for deeply understanding the coevolution of the knowledge diffusion and network structure.

<title>Social networks as the context for understanding employment services utilization among homeless youth</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2014.03.005</url>
<snippet>Little is known about the factors associated with use of employment services among homeless youth. Social network characteristics have been known to be influential in motivating people's decision to seek services. Traditional theoretical frameworks applied to studies of service use emphasize individual factors over social contexts and interactions. Using key social network, social capital, and social influence theories, this paper developed an integrated theoretical framework that capture the social network processes that act as barriers or facilitators of use of employment services by homeless youth, and understand empirically, the salience of each of these constructs in influencing the use of employment services among homeless youth. We used the "Event based-approach" strategy to recruit a sample of 136 homeless youth at one drop-in agency serving homeless youth in Los Angeles, California in 2008. The participants were queried regarding their individual and network characteristics. Data were entered into NetDraw 2.090 and the spring embedder routine was used to generate the network visualizations. Logistic regression was used to assess the influence of the network characteristics on use of employment services. The study findings suggest that social capital is more significant in understanding why homeless youth use employment services, relative to network structure and network influence. In particular, bonding and bridging social capital were found to have differential effects on use of employment services among this population. The results from this study provide specific directions for interventions aimed to increase use of employment services among homeless youth. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

<title>Bowling alone but tweeting together: the evolution of human interaction in the social networking era</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-013-9863-z</url>
<snippet>The objective of this paper is to theoretically analyze how human interaction may evolve in a world characterized by the explosion of online networking and other Web-mediated ways of building and nurturing relationships. The analysis shows that online networking yields a storage mechanism through which any individual contribution-e.g. a blog post, a comment, or a photo-is stored within a particular network and ready for virtual access by each member who connects to the network. When someone provides feedback, for example by commenting on a note, or by replying to a message, the interaction is finalized. These interactions are asynchronous, i.e. they allow individuals to relate in different moments, whenever they have time to. When the social environment is poor of participation opportunities and/or the pressure on time increases (for example due to the need to increase the working time), the stock of information and ties stored in the Internet can help individuals to defend their sociability.

<snippet>The purpose of this research was to examine the interactions between the focal firm (FF) and its technological alliance, and to enquire into the technological alliance network in shaping the firm position from innovative dynamics environment. 2-Mode network analysis was employed to explore the question of how technological position emerged from alliance interaction. Specifically, we looked at the network structure of the sample by examining the interactions of technological alliance. Our empirical data were from the 'Strategic Alliance Database' established by the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan. We identified technological position of firms from the 2-mode network analysis to resolve the highlighted question. Some results that we found were as follows: (1) The alliance network of IT technology approximated an ideal core/periphery structure. (2) The network structure apparently demonstrated that FF with a higher centrality has better opportunity to locate in the central position of FFs or in the core position in the technological network. (3) Alliance in core with a dense structure can better facilitate the utilisation of existing knowledge in refinement and extension of existing technologies. Alliance in the periphery with a non-dense structure is in a favourable position for matchmaking of experimentation and to serve as a bridge to introduce novel technologies.

<title>Toward Detecting Rumor Initiator in Online Social Networks Using Ontology-Driven Model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13369-024-08852-7</url>
<snippet>Online social networks (OSNs) have become breeding grounds for negative content like rumor, misinformation, disinformation, etc. A rumor is an unverified piece of information in circulation. Rumor diffusion is one of the important problems that OSNs are facing. Finding rumor initiator in an OSN is both important and challenging. Firstly, most of the solutions proposed are based on network structure while completely ignoring network semantics. Secondly, the solutions proposed are for networks that are limited in cycles, directions, and degrees. To deal with semantics and limited network structure, researchers have proposed ontological models for OSNs. However, these models are intended to solve problems like social tagging mechanism, social network access control, rumor detection, rumor modeling, etc., rather than finding rumor initiators in OSNs. In this research article, we propose an ontology-based model for OSNs that is intended to find rumor initiators in OSNs. This model comprises three layers-design-time layer, integration layer, and runtime layer. The model maps interoperable concepts of different OSNs in the upper-level ontology, which is further used to obtain vendor-specific lower-level ontology. The model is populated and queried using the property path expressions of SPARQL to find rumor initiators for two scenarios, viz. when the veracity of the rumor is known and when the veracity of the rumor is unknown. Further, the model is assessed using the OQuaRE framework for ontology quality assessment. The OQuaRE framework evaluated our proposed model for seven characteristics of ontology quality, viz. structural, functional adequacy, maintainability, reliability, operability, compatibility, and transferability.

<title>Influence of Social Network Strength on Entrepreneurial Opportunity Recognition: A Chain Mediation Model of Need Knowledge and Technological Knowledge</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/3817644</url>
<snippet>Entrepreneurial opportunity recognition is a key focus of entrepreneurship research and has received considerable attention in recent years. Previous research has highlighted that social network strength, need knowledge, and technological knowledge are important factors in entrepreneurial opportunity recognition and that these factors in isolation cannot sufficiently explain how entrepreneurial opportunities are recognized. Nonetheless, little is known about the effect that social network strength may exert on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition through need knowledge and technological knowledge. Building on social network theory, this study develops and examines a chain mediation model that incorporates need knowledge and technological knowledge into the relationship between social network strength and entrepreneurial opportunity recognition. The results of this study demonstrate that the effect of social network strength on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition can be partitioned into the direct and indirect effects. In particular, the effect of social network strength on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition is mediated by need knowledge, not by technological knowledge. Moreover, need knowledge and technological knowledge play a continuous mediating role in the relationship between social network strength and entrepreneurial opportunity recognition. These findings extend the entrepreneurial opportunity recognition literature by casting light on the knowledge conduits linking social network strength to entrepreneurial opportunity recognition.

<snippet>In the social mobility literature, the position generator (PG) has been used to examine the relationship between the structural location of individuals. and outcomes such as obtaining a high status job. Diversity of occupational ties (as measured by the PG) is also a significant predictor of an individual's cultural capital. A great deal of work has also been done in the field of social movements examining the relationship between networks and mobilization. However, only limited attention has been given to the position generator in this literature. Also, while past research has demonstrated that prior network ties to activists is one of the most important predictors of current activism, relatively little research has been devoted to examining network structure as an outcome of activism. The present paper builds upon these insights by utilizing data collected with the position generator on a sample of environmental movement members, and examining the relationship between individual activism (as an independent variable) and diversity of occupational ties (as a dependent variable). The result of key theoretical significance is that those who are more active in the environmental movement develop a greater diversity of occupational ties to other environmentalists. Results suggest that this process occurs over time. These findings provide evidence that social capital (as indicated by network diversity) is one outcome of social movement mobilization.

<title>Why network structure and coordination matter: A social network analysis of sport for disadvantaged people</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1012690216666273</url>
<snippet>Although local governments attempt to promote sports among all layers of society, people with a lower socio-economic status are still under-represented in grassroots sports. Previous studies indicate that inter-sectoral networks and joint efforts can contribute to an increase in sport participation among these groups, but a systematic analysis of the structure, coordination and interactions in the networks is still missing. Insight into networks to promote sport for disadvantaged people may help in designing effective networks. Therefore, we conducted a social network analysis to explore the network structure and characteristics of networks that promote sport participation among disadvantaged people in three Flemish cities. Our results show that the networks needed to be coordinated by a sport administrator, in the initial stage. Once the network is up and running, coordination can be shared so that the sport administration can rely on the experiences of other sectors. More sport initiatives and a better network structure were found in the cities with a community sport development program, through which the sport-for-all policy is implemented and coordinated, compared to a city without such a program.

<title>Sociometric network structure and its association with methamphetamine use norms among homeless youth</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.01.004</url>
<snippet>Homeless youths' social networks are consistently linked with their substance use. Social networks influence behavior through several mechanisms, especially social norms. This study used sociometric analyses to understand whether social norms of drug use behaviors are clustered in network structures and whether these perceived norms (descriptive and injunctive) influence youths' drug use behaviors. An event-based approach was used to delineate boundaries of the two sociometric networks of homeless youth, one in Los Angeles, CA (n = 160) and the other in Santa Monica, CA (n = 130). Network characteristics included centrality (i.e., popularity) and cohesiveness (location in dense subnetworks). The primary outcome was recent methamphetamine use. Results revealed that both descriptive and injunctive norms influenced methamphetamine use. Network cohesion was found to be associated with perception of both descriptive and injunctive norms in both networks, however in opposite directions. Network interventions therefore might be effective if designed to capitalize on social influence that naturally occurs in cohesive parts of networks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<title>Quantifying echo chamber effects in information spreading over political communication networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-019-0213-9</url>
<snippet>Echo chambers in online social networks, in which users prefer to interact only with ideologically-aligned peers, are believed to facilitate misinformation spreading and contribute to radicalize political discourse. In this paper, we gauge the effects of echo chambers in information spreading phenomena over political communication networks. Mining 12 million Twitter messages, we reconstruct a network in which users interchange opinions related to the impeachment of the former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. We define a continuous political leaning parameter, independent of the network's structure, that allows to quantify the presence of echo chambers in the strongly connected component of the network. These are reflected in two well-separated communities of similar sizes with opposite views of the impeachment process. By means of simple spreading models, we show that the capability of users in propagating the content they produce, measured by the associated spreading capacity, strongly depends on their attitude. Users expressing pro-impeachment leanings are capable to transmit information, on average, to a larger audience than users expressing anti-impeachment leanings. Furthermore, the users' spreading capacity is correlated to the diversity, in terms of political position, of the audience reached. Our method can be exploited to identify the presence of echo chambers and their effects across different contexts and shed light upon the mechanisms allowing to break echo chambers.

<title>Social Media and Protest Participation: Evidence From Russia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA14281</url>
<snippet>Do new communication technologies, such as social media, alleviate the collective action problem? This paper provides evidence that penetration of VK, the dominant Russian online social network, led to more protest activity during a wave of protests in Russia in 2011. As a source of exogenous variation in network penetration, we use the information on the city of origin of the students who studied with the founder of VK, controlling for the city of origin of the students who studied at the same university several years earlier or later. We find that a 10&#37; increase in VK penetration increased the probability of a protest by 4.6&#37; and the number of protesters by 19&#37;. Additional results suggest that social media induced protest activity by reducing the costs of coordination rather than by spreading information critical of the government. We observe that VK penetration increased pro-governmental support, with no evidence of increased polarization. We also find that cities with higher fractionalization of network users between VK and Facebook experienced fewer protests, and the effect of VK on protests exhibits threshold behavior.

<title>Utilising qualitative data for social network analysis in disaster research: opportunities, challenges, and an illustration</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/disa.12605</url>
<snippet>An abundance of unstructured and loosely structured data on disasters exists and can be analysed using network methods. This paper overviews the use of qualitative data in quantitative social network analysis in disaster research. It discusses two types of networks, each with a relevant major topic in disaster research-that is, (i) whole network approaches to emergency management networks and (ii) personal network approaches to the social support of survivors-and four usable forms of qualitative data. This paper explains five opportunities afforded by these approaches, revolving around their flexibility and ability to account for complex network structures. Next, it presents an empirical illustration that extends the authors' previous work examining the sources and the types of support and barrier experienced by households during long-term recovery from Hurricane (Superstorm) Sandy (2012), wherein quantitative social network analysis was applied to two qualitative datasets. The paper discusses three challenges associated with these approaches, related to the samples, coding, and bias.

<title>Diversity in action: Interpersonal networks and the distribution of advice</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2012.08.013</url>
<snippet>Does diversity beget the active dissemination of social support in the form of advice to others? Previous research by Robert Putnam suggests that individuals in compositionally diverse geographical areas become closed off from their social ties and less trusting of others, which are both antithetical to social support exchange. We argue, however, that studies of compositional diversity are ill-suited to reflect diversity as it is actually lived and experienced in social life. Drawing from the first nationally representative study with comprehensive indicators of interactional diversity in social life, we analyze self-reports of advice-giving across a variety of social roles. Results of regression analysis are consistent: greater interactional diversity is positively associated with advice-giving, whether the target is stranger, neighbor, close friend, or family member. These findings hold independent of important covariates such as reciprocity, sociability, and homophily. This research contributes to a growing literature set on identifying the unanticipated benefits of diversity in modern society. In sum, we call future research to consider not only diversity in structure, but also diversity in action. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<title>Pathways to environmental activism in four countries: social media, environmental concern, and political efficacy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13676261.2021.2011845</url>
<snippet>In 2018-9, millions of youth participated in climate-related marches across the globe. This activism reflects youth's distinctive form of political participation: cause-oriented, expressive, and networked. However, the pathway between environmental concern and environmental activism is complicated in some contexts and for some citizens. This article uses survey data from four countries (Canada, France, the United Kingdom, the United States) gathered in autumn 2019. We focus on the environmental activism of youth and young adults (aged 18-33 years, n = 1574). We find the role of social media is consistent and strong for all environmental activities in all countries; the role of political efficacy depends on activity and country but has a positive role in environmental activism; and environmental concern is a positive and significant correlate of boycotting and signing petitions but a weak predictor of participating in environmental marches. The relationship between environmental concern and environmental marches is distinctive in the United Kingdom. Overall, we find that concern about a social cause does not automatically translate into increased activism related to that cause. Moreover, online social networks, political efficacy, and political context are critical to understanding this mobilization process.

<title>Science vs Conspiracy: Collective Narratives in the Age of Misinformation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118093</url>
<snippet>The large availability of user provided contents on online social media facilitates people aggregation around shared beliefs, interests, worldviews and narratives. In spite of the enthusiastic rhetoric about the so called collective intelligence unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories-e.g., chemtrails, reptilians or the Illuminati-are pervasive in online social networks (OSN). In this work we study, on a sample of 1.2 million of individuals, how information related to very distinct narratives-i.e. main stream scientific and conspiracy news-are consumed and shape communities on Facebook. Our results show that polarized communities emerge around distinct types of contents and usual consumers of conspiracy news result to be more focused and self-contained on their specific contents. To test potential biases induced by the continued exposure to unsubstantiated rumors on users' content selection, we conclude our analysis measuring how users respond to 4,709 troll information-i.e. parodistic and sarcastic imitation of conspiracy theories. We find that 77.92&#37; of likes and 80.86&#37; of comments are from users usually interacting with conspiracy stories.

<title>Modelling Multilevel Interdependencies for Resilience in Complex Organisation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/3946356</url>
<snippet>This paper aims to model multilevel interdependencies in complex organisational systems and proposes application for resilience analysis. Most of the existing research studied interdependencies only at the single-level and overlooked their multilevel character. In response to this gap, we propose a multilevel approach to better comprehend the complexity of interdependencies in organisational systems. More specifically, the study focuses on how interdependencies are shaped across multiple organisational levels. To understand the research problem, we use multilevel and social network theories to elaborate the concept at five organisational levels, namely, individual, intraunit, interunit, intraorganisational, and interorganisational. Further, we show the application of multilevel interdependencies into analysis of organisational resilience. To this end, we construct a multiplex model of a real world organisational system that comprises formal and informal relations of different social exchange strength. Using the agent-based simulations of the organisational system, we investigate the relations between organisational interdependencies and organisational performance in normal and disrupted conditions. With the results, we argue that managing multilevel interdependencies is crucial to reduce vulnerability of organisational systems. By introducing the multilevel conceptualisation of interdependencies and presenting their influence on organisational resilience, we hope to pave a path to managing the complexity of interdependencies and strategic resilience enhancement in organisational systems.

<title>Endogenous thresholds and assurance networks in collective action</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1043463115621523</url>
<snippet>This article treats a multi-player Stag Hunt where each player may have a different threshold (the number of other players that need to act along with the player for benefits of collective action to arise). Players are modeled as solving the strategic-uncertainty problem of whether or not to act, by assuring each other of their willingness to act. We show that in equilibrium there may, but need not, be homophily (players with the same thresholds seek assurance from each other) or a threshold-based social hierarchy (players with high thresholds, or conservatives, seek assurance from players with low thresholds, or radicals, but not vice versa). Put otherwise, a new strategic-uncertainty problem arises, namely, the problem of who should seek assurance from whom. We propose that players solve this problem by forming core-periphery assurance networks, with a number of players equal to the largest threshold in the core, and the remaining players in the periphery.

<title>Inference and influence of network structure using snapshot social behavior without network data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb8762</url>
<snippet>Population behavior, like voting and vaccination, depends on the structure of social networks. This structure can differ depending on behavior type and is typically hidden. However, we do often have behavioral data, albeit only snapshots taken at one time point. We present a method jointly inferring a model for both network structure and human behavior using only snapshot population-level behavioral data. This exploits the simplicity of a few parameter model, geometric sociodemographic network model, and a spin-based model of behavior. We illustrate, for the European Union referendum and two London mayoral elections, how the model offers both prediction and the interpretation of the homophilic inclinations of the population. Beyond extracting behavior-specific network structure from behavioral datasets, our approach yields a framework linking inequalities and social preferences to behavioral outcomes. We illustrate potential network-sensitive policies: How changes to income inequality, social temperature, and homophilic preferences might have reduced polarization in a recent election.

<title>The work and relatedness of ties mediated online in supporting long-term condition self-management</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9566.13042</url>
<snippet>The 'care transition' is characterised by reduced state involvement in chronic illness management in response to socio-political movements aimed at meeting the challenges presented by an increased prevalence of chronic illness. Amongst these changes has been online communities' rising importance in everyday interactions and attention is being increasingly paid towards the ways online contacts might contribute to self-management. Whilst research has illuminated the relevance of personal networks in long-term condition management, it is relevant to extend this work to consider the place of ties mediated online in this bricolage of support, including better understanding the work drawn from them and the strategies involved in eliciting it. This study examined the work and relatedness of 30 participants, who used online communities. Participants were asked about the role of on and offline ties and ego network mapping was used to frame conversations about the nature of this support. The context of engagement followed three main themes. Participants drew from online communities in response to deficits in offline support, they used online ties to leverage support or action from offline ties and they used online ties to substitute offline support, with less intimate online ties.

<title>SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS UPDATES Family SES and emergent social capital in college student Facebook networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2011.562221</url>
<snippet>There are numerous indirect ways in which socioeconomic status (SES) can advantage or disadvantage people in developing social capital. Specifically, SES affects the access individuals have to beneficial resources that indirectly affects the social capital benefits individuals receive from personal and group social networks. With the advent of social network sites like Facebook, the ability to quantify and measure the effects of SES on social capital benefits is possible to a much greater degree than ever before. This study of undergraduate students focuses on the relationship between SES and social capital. We examine the relationship between SES and three structural measures of students' social capital using online social network data: general social capital (network size), bridging social capital (number of clusters), and bonding social capital (average degree). According to our results, higher SES relates to larger and denser networks, but not to networks with more clusters. These findings suggest that SES is not related to greater opportunities for networking, but better capitalization of existing network contexts. In addition to the novel substantive contribution, this paper offers a methodological advance in the structural study of social capital, which has previously been limited in size or complexity due to recall.

<title>Abstract cognitive maps of social network structure aid adaptive inference</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2310801120</url>
<snippet>Social navigation-such as anticipating where gossip may spread, or identifying which acquaintances can help land a job-relies on knowing how people are connected within their larger social communities. Problematically, for most social networks, the space of possible relationships is too vast to observe and memorize. Indeed, people's knowledge of these social relations is well known to be biased and error- prone. Here, we reveal that these biased representations reflect a fundamental computation that abstracts over individual relationships to enable principled inferences about unseen relationships. We propose a theory of network representation that explains how people learn inferential cognitive maps of social relations from direct observation, what kinds of knowledge structures emerge as a consequence, and why it can be beneficial to encode systematic biases into social cognitive maps. Leveraging simulations, laboratory experiments, and "field data" from a real -world network, we find that people abstract observations of direct relations (e.g., friends) into inferences of multistep relations (e.g., friends - of- friends).This multistep abstraction mechanism enables people to discover and represent complex social network structure, affording adaptive inferences across a variety of contexts, includ-ing friendship, trust, and advice- giving. Moreover, this multistep abstraction mechanism unifies a variety of otherwise puzzling empirical observations about social behavior. Our proposal generalizes the theory of cognitive maps to the fundamental computational problem of social inference, presenting a powerful framework for understanding the workings of a predictive mind operating within a complex social world.SignificanceSuccessful navigation through our social communities-from identifying which "weak ties" can help land a job to deciding whether a friend -of - a- friendcan be trusted-necessitates that people build cognitive maps of how individuals are connected within a social network. Because our observations of others' relationships are noisy and incomplete, people need to fill gaps in relational knowledge by inferring the existence of unknown and unobserved relationships. Here, we demonstrate that predictive inferences emerge from a simple cognitive mechanism that abstracts observations of known friendships to multistep relations (e.g., friends - of- friends).This mechanism can parsimoniously explain how people infer a variety of social behaviors, like trust and advice- seeking.

<title>Mnemonic convergence in social networks: The emergent properties of cognition at a collective level</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1525569113</url>
<snippet>The development of shared memories, beliefs, and norms is a fundamental characteristic of human communities. These emergent outcomes are thought to occur owing to a dynamic system of information sharing and memory updating, which fundamentally depends on communication. Here we report results on the formation of collective memories in laboratory-created communities. We manipulated conversational network structure in a series of real-time, computer-mediated interactions in fourteen 10-member communities. The results show that mnemonic convergence, measured as the degree of overlap among community members' memories, is influenced by both individual-level information-processing phenomena and by the conversational social network structure created during conversational recall. By studying laboratory-created social networks, we show how large-scale social phenomena (i.e., collective memory) can emerge out of microlevel local dynamics (i.e., mnemonic reinforcement and suppression effects). The social-interactionist approach proposed herein points to optimal strategies for spreading information in social networks and provides a framework for measuring and forging collective memories in communities of individuals.

<title>Twitter publics: how online political communities signaled electoral outcomes in the 2010 US house election</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2014.892149</url>
<snippet>Online social networks are an important setting for understanding the intersection of online communities and offline political processes. This paper analyzes the different ways that people discuss elections on Twitter. Using data from a random sample totaling 113,985 tweets and 30,995 users, we examine the differences between users who employ various strategies to talk about US 2010 Congressional candidates. We show that users who simply include the text of a candidate's name in a message exhibit different behaviors than those who use platform-specific mechanisms. Users who employ free-text tend to have younger accounts, are less likely to be 'verified', and generate fewer messages about candidates. Furthermore, candidates' share of the free-text Twitter public has a larger correlation with their vote tallies than @mentions or hashtags. This research has methodological implications for studying the dynamics between online discourse and offline behavior. Overall, our findings support the view that forms of communication that are more accessible are more indicative of broader social trends.

<title>Homophily and prestige: An assessment of their relative strength to explain link formation in the online climate change debate</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2018.05.001</url>
<snippet>Previous work has shown that hyperlinks reflect actors' strategic choices; these dyadic relationships depend on the actors' exogenous attributes (e.g., homophily) and the network's endogenous features (e.g., prestige distribution among actors). We combine these factors as explanatory variables in different exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to assess the relative strength of prestige and homophily for the actors' link formation. We analyze the climate change discourse in a hyperlink network formed by US civil society actors from November 2014 and test how relevant the different factors are, including variables such as actor type, country, position, and topic. We find that both prestige and various aspects of homophily influence link formation online. With regard to the importance of the different factors, positional homophily stands out, followed by prestige and other homophily effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Seasonality and pathogen transmission in pastoral cattle contact networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.170808</url>
<snippet>Capturing heterogeneity in contact patterns in animal populations is essential for understanding the spread of infectious diseases. In contrast to other regions of the world in which livestock movement networks are integral to pathogen prevention and control policies, contact networks are understudied in pastoral regions of Africa due to the challenge of measuring contact among mobile herds of cattle whose movements are driven by access to resources. Furthermore, the extent to which seasonal changes in the distribution of water and resources impacts the structure of contact networks in cattle is uncertain. Contact networks may be more conducive to pathogen spread in the dry season due to congregation at limited water sources. Alternatively, less abundant forage may result in decreased pathogen transmission due to competitive avoidance among herds, as measured by reduced contact rates. Here, we use GPS technology to concurrently track 49 free-roaming cattle herds within a semi-arid region of Kenya, and use these data to characterize seasonal contact networks and model the spread of a highly infectious pathogen. This work provides the first empirical data on the local contact network structure of mobile herds based on quantifiable contact events. The contact network demonstrated high levels of interconnectivity. An increase in contacts near to water resources in the dry season resulted in networks with both higher contact rates and higher potential for pathogen spread than in the wet season. Simulated disease outbreaks were also larger in the dry season. Results support the hypothesis that limited water resources enhance connectivity and transmission within contact networks, as opposed to reducing connectivity as a result of competitive avoidance. These results cast light on the impact of seasonal heterogeneity in resource availability on predicting pathogen transmission dynamics, which has implications for other free-ranging wild and domestic populations.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2014.934390</url>
<snippet>Despite widespread adoption of information and communications technologies (ICTs) by families in the United States, little is known about parents' use of ICTs specifically for family communication. Using a national sample of parents (N = 1322), this study examined parents' use of four widely used ICTs (text message, email, social networking sites, and Skype) to communicate with family including differences in use by child's age. Results show parents' use of various ICTs is dynamic, reflecting developmental differences in the child and relational differences in the family system. Findings revealed that the use of ICTs for parent-child communication increased with child's age, communication with co-parent via text message was more likely among parents of school-aged children, and parents of adolescent children were less likely to use text or email to communicate with non-resident family than parents of school-aged children. Examining how parents are using specific ICTs to communicate with particular family members furthers our understanding of the impact of technology on communication processes occurring within families in today's digital age.

<title>Identification of influencers in online social networks: measuring influence considering multidimensional factors exploration</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06472</url>
<snippet>Online Social networks exhibit heterogeneous nature with nodes playing far different roles in structure and function. To identify influencers is thus very significant, allowing us to control the outbreak of public negative opinion, to conduct advertisements for e-commercial products, to predict popular scientific publications, and so on. The identification of influencers attracts increasing attentions from both computer science and communication science, with multiple dimensional metrics ranging from structure-based to information-based and action-based. However, most work simply rely on one dimensional metrics. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze three dimensional characteristics (structure-based, information-based, and action-based factors) to develop the multi-dimensional social influence (MSI) measurement approach. With topic distillation and conditional expectation, the MSI approach can not only measure users topic-level influence, but also measure users global-level influence. Based on data collected from SinaWeibo.com, the experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms two traditional methods (LeaderRank and FBI) both on the topic-level and the global-level. The proposed framework can be effectively applied to promote word-of-mouth marketing, and to steer public opinion in certain directions, even to support decisions during a negotiation process.

<title>Beyond collective intelligence: Collective adaptation</title>

<snippet>We develop a conceptual framework for studying collective adaptation in complex socio-cognitive systems, driven by dynamic interactions of social integration strategies, social environments and problem structures. Going beyond searching for 'intelligent' collectives, we integrate research from different disciplines and outline modelling approaches that can be used to begin answering questions such as why collectives sometimes fail to reach seemingly obvious solutions, how they change their strategies and network structures in response to different problems and how we can anticipate and perhaps change future harmful societal trajectories. We discuss the importance of considering path dependence, lack of optimization and collective myopia to understand the sometimes counterintuitive outcomes of collective adaptation. We call for a transdisciplinary, quantitative and societally useful social science that can help us to understand our rapidly changing and ever more complex societies, avoid collective disasters and reach the full potential of our ability to organize in adaptive collectives.

<snippet>The spread of misinformation through media and social networks threatens many aspects of society, including public health and the state of democracies. One approach to mitigating the effect of misinformation focuses on individual-level interventions, equipping policymakers and the public with essential tools to curb the spread and influence of falsehoods. Here we introduce a toolbox of individual-level interventions for reducing harm from online misinformation. Comprising an up-to-date account of interventions featured in 81 scientific papers from across the globe, the toolbox provides both a conceptual overview of nine main types of interventions, including their target, scope and examples, and a summary of the empirical evidence supporting the interventions, including the methods and experimental paradigms used to test them. The nine types of interventions covered are accuracy prompts, debunking and rebuttals, friction, inoculation, lateral reading and verification strategies, media-literacy tips, social norms, source-credibility labels, and warning and fact-checking labels. Kozyreva et al. review evidence from individual-level interventions for fighting online misinformation featured in 81 scientific papers. They classify the interventions in nine different types and summarize their findings in a toolbox.

This effect may explain recent findings that widespread social network media use leads to reduced happiness. However the relation between popularity and happiness is poorly understood. A Friendship paradox does not necessarily imply a Happiness paradox where most individuals are less happy than their friends. Here we report the first direct observation of a significant Happiness Paradox in a large-scale online social network of 39,110 Twitter users. Our results reveal that popular individuals are indeed happier and that a majority of individuals experience a significant Happiness paradox. The magnitude of the latter effect is shaped by complex interactions between individual popularity, happiness, and the fact that users strongly cluster by similar level of happiness. Our results indicate that the topology of online social networks, combined with how happiness is distributed in some populations, may be associated with significant psycho-social effects.

<title>Network-based diffusion analysis reveals context-specific dominance of dance communication in foraging honeybees</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14410-0</url>
<snippet>The honeybee (Apis mellifera) dance communication system is a marvel of collective behaviour, but the added value it brings to colony foraging efficiency is poorly understood. In temperate environments, preventing communication of foraging locations rarely decreases colony food intake, potentially because simultaneous transmission of olfactory information also plays a major role in foraging. Here, we employ social network analyses that quantify information flow across multiple temporally varying networks (each representing a different interaction type) to evaluate the relative contributions of dance communication and hive-based olfactory information transfer to honeybee recruitment events. We show that virtually all successful recruits to novel locations rely upon dance information rather than olfactory cues that could otherwise guide them to the same resource. Conversely, during reactivation to known sites, dances are relatively less important, as foragers are primarily guided by olfactory information. By disentangling the contributions of multiple information networks, the contexts in which dance communication truly matters amid a complex system full of redundancy can now be identified. Honeybees have a sophisticated system to communicate foraging locations through a "dance", but they also share food-related olfactory cues. Here, Hasenjager and colleagues use social network analysis to disentangle how foraging information is transmitted through these systems in different contexts.

<title>People lie, actions Don't! Modeling infodemic proliferation predictors among social media users</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.101930</url>
<snippet>Social media is interactive, and interaction brings misinformation. With the growing amount of user-generated data, fake news on online platforms has become much more frequent since the arrival of social networks. Now and then, an event occurs and becomes the topic of discussion, generating and propagating false information. Existing literature studying fake news elaborates primarily on fake news classification models. Approaches exploring fake news characteristics to distinguish it from real news are minimal. Not much research has focused on statistical testing and generating new factor discoveries. This study assumes fifteen hypotheses to identify factors exhibiting a relationship with fake news. We perform the experiments on two real-world COVID-19 datasets using qualitative and quantitative testing methods. We determine the impact of conditional effects among sentiment, gender, and media usage. This study concludes that sentiment polarity and gender can significantly identify fake news. Dependence on the presence of visual media is, however, inconclusive. Additionally, Twitter-specific user engagement factors like followers count, friends count, favorite count, and retweet count significantly differ in fake and real news. Though, the contribution of status count is currently disputed. This study identifies practical factors to be conjunctly utilized in developing fake news detection algorithms.

<title>Values and economic performance across European welfare state regimes: Direct and indirect effects through social capital, human capital and managerial skills</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0298667</url>
<snippet>The values that people hold are linked to their economic performance. These links can be either direct or indirect, operating through moderating variables such as social network participation, interpersonal trust, trust in institutions, human capital, managerial skills and hours worked. In this paper these effects are studied using structural equation modelling (SEM) methodology applied to European Social Survey data from 28 European countries in 2018. Schwartz classification of values is used, distinguishing between Self-Enhancement (Power, Achievement), Openness to Change (Self-Direction), Conservation (Tradition, Security, Conformity) and Self-Transcendence (Universalism, Benevolence) values. It is found that Power has the strongest positive direct effect on economic performance, further strengthened by a positive indirect structural effect through hours worked. Self-Direction is indirectly positively linked to economic performance through higher managerial skills and hours worked. Tradition has a strong negative direct effect on economic performance. Security is indirectly negatively linked with economic performance, owing to its negative effects on interpersonal trust, management skills and hours worked. Some of the identified effects are context-dependent and vary across European welfare state regimes. For example, Power is statistically significantly linked to economic performance only in the liberal and conservative regime. Values promoted by respective welfare state regimes are not necessarily associated with higher incomes within those regimes, e.g., Tradition and Security values promoted in the conservative and Mediterranean regime are associated with lower incomes. These findings may lead to a range of policy implications, particularly in relation to the policies on immigration, demographics, the labor market, and work-life balance. Unfortunately, due to the cross-sectional character of the dataset, causal relations among the variables of interest could not be identified.

<title>Successful Linkage Between Formal and Informal Care Systems: The Mobilization of Outside Help by Caregivers of Persons With Alzheimer's Disease</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1049732312451870</url>
<snippet>Health interventions are currently being revamped to address the specific needs of chronic illness and population aging. In this context, focus has increasingly turned to Alzheimer-type dementia, an illness that is considered to mobilize a large number of social actors into long-term involvement of varying intensity. Linkage problems between families and professional systems have been well documented, yet the reasons for this remain relatively unexplored. In this article, we outline how we used social network data and narrative methods to better understand the linkage processes between formal and informal care systems. We present the trajectories of four caregivers of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease who were able to establish relationships with resources outside the family. In each of the cases, the dimensions of trust and recognition were central to establishing and maintaining supportive relationships, and must therefore be understood in light of social network dynamics and the broader environment. Although preliminary, this study contributes to the state of knowledge on linkage problems by proposing "bottom-up" solutions that are client centered.

<title>Can social network analysis contribute to supply chain management? A systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e26598</url>
<snippet>Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a modeling technique and analytical approach well-suited for identifying and examining the structural features of supply networks and the patterns of connections between members within the network. This paper aims to present a systematic review and bibliometric analysis by investigating network structural properties and metrics in supply chain management (SCM) research. The approach involved combining a systematic literature review with a bibliometric analysis, forming a two-part methodology to examine 113 articles published between 2008 and 2023 in 62 journals. Our systematic thematic analysis reveals how SCM researchers have applied SNA techniques in terms of the reported node-level and networklevel structural metrics, including network configuration description metrics, centrality measures, supply network subgroups, and models of supply network structure and formation. We identify the gaps in the existing body of literature and propose potential directions for future research. By quantitatively analyzing, classifying, and visualizing bibliographic data of previous studies, this paper provides further insights into the application of network structural properties in SCM research. Furthermore, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the significance of the supply network's relational structure and configuration. Considering the disruptions to global supply chains caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russo-Ukrainian War, our findings can contribute to a better understanding of strategic supply network design.

<title>Tracing You: How transparent surveillance reveals a desire for visibility</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2053951717694053</url>
<snippet>Tracing You is an artwork that presents a website's best attempt to see the world from its visitors' viewpoints. By cross referencing visitor IP addresses with available online data sources, the work traces each visitor back through the network to its possible origin. The end of that trace is the closest available image that potentially shows the visitor's physical environment. Sometimes what this image shows is eerily accurate; other times it is wildly dislocated. This computational surveillance system thus makes transparent the potential visibility of one's present location on the Earth, while also giving each site visitor the ability to watch other visitor "traces" in real time. By making its surveillance capacity and intention overt, Tracing You provokes questions about the architecture of networks and how that architecture affects our own visibility both within and outside of the network. Further, reactions to the work reveal attitudes towards surveillance post-Snowden, including, in some cases, an angry desire for more visibility than Tracing You currently provides. This commentary describes how the artwork functions, presents and discusses visitor reactions, and briefly theorizes origins for these reactions within the contexts of surveillance, sousveillance, and transparency in the age of ubiquitous online social networks.

<title>COLLECTIVE ACTION ON THE WEB A cross-cultural study of social networking sites and online and offline activism in the United States and Latin America</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2011.591411</url>
<snippet>Social networking sites (SNS) are credited with organizing protesters in Colombia and Guatemala, and mobilizing voters in the United States. With SNS increasingly used to mobilize collective action, this cross-cultural study surveyed activists in the United States and Latin America to examine how respondents perceived the usefulness and the potential of SNS for activism. This quantitative and qualitative research found that respondents from both regions use SNS to mobilize supporters both online and offline. Whether respondents' activism occurred mostly offline, mostly online, or equally offline and online, they all participated equally in offline activism. Countering previous research doubting the ability of online activism to inspire offline actions, results show respondents believe that online activism translates into offline activism, and that SNS play an important role in contemporary activism. Still, US activists were more likely than those in Latin America to use SNS for activism, or to say their activism occurred mostly online.

<title>How Do Low-Income People Form Survival Networks? Routine Organizations as Brokers</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002716220915431</url>
<snippet>While supportive social ties help to buffer against the consequences of poverty, few researchers have examined how people form such ties. New ties are often formed in routine organizations such as businesses, churches, and childcare centers, which, beyond being places to work, shop, or receive services, are institutionally governed spaces of social interaction. Based on the notion of organizational brokerage, we introduce a perspective that specifies when routine organizations contribute to tie formation and use it to reexamine data from existing qualitative studies of such organizations among the poor. We argue that successful brokerage will depend on the degree to which an organization's institutional norms render interaction among participants frequent, long-lasting, focused on others, and centered on joint tasks; and that the ensuing networks may differ from other supportive ties in the sense of belonging they may cultivate, the form of generalized exchange they may engender, and the organizational connections they may create.

<title>Social Distance in the United States: Sex, Race, Religion, Age, and Education Homophily among Confidants, 1985 to 2004</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122414531776</url>
<snippet>Homophily, the tendency for similar actors to be connected at a higher rate than dissimilar actors, is a pervasive social fact. In this article, we examine changes over a 20-year period in two types of homophily-the actual level of contact between people in different social categories and the level of contact relative to chance. We use data from the 1985 and 2004 General Social Surveys to ask whether the strengths of five social distinctions-sex, race/ethnicity, religious affiliation, age, and education-changed over the past two decades in core discussion networks. Changes in the actual level of homophily are driven by the demographic composition of the United States. As the nation has become more diverse, cross-category contacts in race/ethnicity and religion have increased. After describing the raw homophily rates, we develop a case-control model to assess homophily relative to chance mixing. We find decreasing rates of homophily for gender but stability for race and age, although the young are increasingly isolated from older cohorts outside of the family. We also find some weak evidence for increasing educational and religious homophily. These relational trends may be explained by changes in demographic heterogeneity, institutional segregation, economic inequality, and symbolic boundaries.

<title>What Tweets and YouTube comments have in common? Sentiment and graph analysis on data related to US elections 2020</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270542</url>
<snippet>Most studies analyzing political traffic on Social Networks focus on a single platform, while campaigns and reactions to political events produce interactions across different social media. Ignoring such cross-platform traffic may lead to analytical errors, missing important interactions across social media that e.g. explain the cause of trending or viral discussions. This work links Twitter and YouTube social networks using cross-postings of video URLs on Twitter to discover the main tendencies and preferences of the electorate, distinguish users and communities' favouritism towards an ideology or candidate, study the sentiment towards candidates and political events, and measure political homophily. This study shows that Twitter communities correlate with YouTube comment communities: that is, Twitter users belonging to the same community in the Retweet graph tend to post YouTube video links with comments from YouTube users belonging to the same community in the YouTube Comment graph. Specifically, we identify Twitter and YouTube communities, we measure their similarity and differences and show the interactions and the correlation between the largest communities on YouTube and Twitter. To achieve that, we have gather a dataset of approximately 20M tweets and the comments of 29K YouTube videos; we present the volume, the sentiment, and the communities formed in YouTube and Twitter graphs, and publish a representative sample of the dataset, as allowed by the corresponding Twitter policy restrictions.

<title>Dynamic Mechanism of Destination Brand Diffusion: Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems12040124</url>
<snippet>In recent years, social media has emerged as an important channel for the dissemination of destination branding. Despite the fact that the dissemination of information through social media enables a broader audience to become acquainted with destinations, the dissemination process of trending events exhibits variances. Consequently, the precise impact of the underlying mechanisms that govern the spread of information on the efficacy of disseminating destination brand trending events remains ambiguous. In an endeavor to bridge this gap, an improved SEIR model was developed in this research to investigate the dynamic dissemination mechanisms and influencing factors of destination trending events within social media. The model was applied to simulate the diffusion mechanism of destinations' trending events. The results show that during the dissemination process of destination trending events on social media, the proportion of users affected at different stages influences the ultimate effectiveness of information propagation. In light of these insights, this research proposes a social media trending event dissemination strategy to aid in enhancing the propagation efficiency of destination brands through existing resources.

<title>Social networks, disinformation and diplomacy: a dynamic model for a current problem</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01998-z</url>
<snippet>The potential of social networks for the circulation of disinformation as a strategy of diplomacy has been of great interest to the academic community, but the way in which it is propagated and modelled is still in its beginnings. This article aimed to simulate the propagation of disinformation in social networks derived from the diplomacy strategy, based on the elements of the system. The main research question that was opened up was how do the elements of disinformation derived from the social media diplomacy strategy interact to affect a susceptible population? For the design of the simulation model, system dynamics was used as the main technique in the re-search methodology in conjunction with statistical analysis. Five computational simulations were run for the adoption methods of susceptible and uninformed population, misinformation techniques and echo chamber. The model developed found that the diplomacy disinformation agent is able to spread its message efficiently through the bot outreach mechanism and only a part of the susceptible population unsubscribes to the disinformation agent's account. Significant differences were identified in the absence of paid outreach, bots and trolls in the propagation of information, and in the variation in the timing of disinformation propagation. Consequently, the developed model allows the understanding of the problem of disinformation as a strategy of diplomacy from international rather than local dynamics, as well as the effects of the use of each element in the system.

<title>The Earnings of Immigrant and Native-Born Men in Canada: The Role of Social Networks and Social Capital</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380253.2018.1526054</url>
<snippet>Using data from the Canadian General Social Survey (2008), this study considers the role of social networks in immigrants' earnings. Despite higher levels of education, immigrants continue to earn less than native-born Canadians. This paper shows that social network characteristics are associated with earnings net of the effects of human capital and visible minority status. Social networks are important for understanding immigrants' earnings both as a direct cause of employment disadvantages and as a force that exacerbates the disadvantages that immigrants face due to racial discrimination, a lack of proficiency in Canada's official languages, and/or discrepancies over foreign credentials. While most current data on immigrant networks is limited to specific ethnic groups, cities, and/or occupations, the present study contributes to scholarship by generalizing data to all immigrants in Canada. This study also expands the temporal scope by comparing immigrants who arrived in the 2000s, 1990s, and earlier. Future research and public policy should put greater emphasis on the role of social networks in the economic integration of new immigrants.

<title>Seed Selection Strategies for Information Diffusion in Social Networks: An Agent-Based Model Applied to Rural Zambia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4429</url>
<snippet>The successful adoption of innovations depends on the provision of adequate information to farmers. In rural areas of developing countries, farmers usually rely on their social networks as an information source. Hence, policy-makers and program-implementers can benefit fromsocial diffusion processes to effectively disseminate information. This study aims to identify the set of farmers who initially obtain information ('seeds') that optimises diffusion through the network. It systematically evaluates different criteria for seed selection, number of seeds, and their interaction effects. An empirical Agent-Based Model adjusted to a case study in rural Zambia was applied to predict diffusion outcomes for varying seed sets ex ante. Simulations revealed that informing farmers with the most connections leads to highest diffusion speed and reach. Also targeting village heads and farmers with high betweenness centrality, who function as bridges connecting different parts of the network, enhances diffusion. An increased number of seeds improves reach, but the marginal effects of additional seeds decline. Interdependencies between seed set size and selection criteria highlight the importance of considering both seed selection criteria and seed set size for optimising seeding strategies to enhance information diffusion.

<title>Transnational entrepreneurial activities: A qualitative network study of self-employed migrants from the former Soviet Union in Germany</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2017.04.007</url>
<snippet>During their careers, migrant entrepreneurs may get involved in different types of transnational entrepreneurial activities and use their social capital to activate transnational business-related ties. Based on content analysis of semi-structured interviews and networks maps with self-employed migrants from the former Soviet Union in Germany this study identified four empirically grounded types of migrant transnational entrepreneurial activities and analysed transnational networking strategies for each type. The study demonstrates that different types of social capital are mobilised for different types of transnational business strategies, with intensive transnational entrepreneurial activities requiring larger pre-existing networks in the country of origin of both strong and weak ties, that are gradually extended, while a more limited set of mostly informal weak ties suffice for more sporadic transnational activities in the country of origin. Transnational entrepreneurial activities with other countries or with multiple countries, on the other hand, involved a more formal network of relationships. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

<title>Cognitive maps of social features enable flexible inference in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2021699118</url>
<snippet>In order to navigate a complex web of relationships, an individual must learn and represent the connections between people in a social network. However, the sheer size and complexity of the social world makes it impossible to acquire firsthand knowledge of all relations within a network, suggesting that people must make inferences about unobserved relationships to fill in the gaps. Across three studies (n = 328), we show that people can encode information about social features (e.g., hobbies, clubs) and subsequently deploy this knowledge to infer the existence of unobserved friendships in the network. Using computational models, we test various feature-based mechanisms that could support such inferences. We find that people's ability to successfully generalize depends on two representational strategies: a simple but inflexible similarity heuristic that leverages homophily, and a complex but flexible cognitive map that encodes the statistical relationships between social features and friendships. Together, our studies reveal that people can build cognitive maps encoding arbitrary patterns of latent relations in many abstract feature spaces, allowing social networks to be represented in a flexible format. Moreover, these findings shed light on open questions across disciplines about how people learn and represent social networks and may have implications for generating more human-like link prediction in machine learning algorithms.

<title>The spread of fake news: Disclosure willingness role</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34468</url>
<snippet>The epidemic has had a profound negative impact on individuals worldwide, leading to pervasive anxiety, fear, and mental instability. Exploiting these fears, a significant amount of fake information proliferates and spreads rapidly on social networks. This study explores the factors that cause individuals to believe fake news under stressful and fearful conditions by applying the truth-default theory. Data was collected online in Vietnam, using Smart PLS software to analyze the research model. The findings indicated that risk perception, media trust, trust in celebrity posts, and stress were factors that urge users to believe news posted on social media, and even they actively share this news on their own channels. Disclosure willingness moderated the relationship between adoption fake news and sharing it. Both theoretical and practical implications were discussed.

<title>Bridging Boundaries? The Effect of Genetic Ancestry Testing on Ties across Racial Groups</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spab082</url>
<snippet>The phenomenon of widespread genetic ancestry testing has raised questions about its social impact, particularly on issues of race. Some accounts suggest testing can promote bridging social capital - connections between racial groups. In this multi-method paper, we ask whether (1) taking genetic ancestry tests (GATs) and (2) receiving results of African, Asian, or Native American ancestry increases network racial diversity for White Americans. We use a randomized controlled trial of 802 White, non-Hispanic Americans, half of whom received GATs. Unexpected findings show that test-takers' network racial diversity decreases after testing. Using 58 follow-up interviews, we develop and test a possible theory, finding initial evidence that test-takers' network racial diversity declines because they reconsider their racial appraisals of others in their networks.

<title>Echo chambers and viral misinformation: Modeling fake news as complex contagion</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203958</url>
<snippet>The viral spread of digital misinformation has become so severe that the World Economic Forum considers it among the main threats to human society. This spread have been suggested to be related to the similarly problematized phenomenon of "echo chambers", but the causal nature of this relationship has proven difficult to disentangle due to the connected nature of social media, whose causality is characterized by complexity, non-linearity and emergence. This paper uses a network simulation model to study a possible relationship between echo chambers and the viral spread of misinformation. It finds an "echo chamber effect": the presence of an opinion and network polarized cluster of nodes in a network contributes to the diffusion of complex contagions, and there is a synergetic effect between opinion and network polarization on the virality of misinformation. The echo chambers effect likely comes from that they form the initial bandwagon for diffusion. These findings have implication for the study of the media logic of new social media.

<title>Who prefers anonymous self-expression online? A survey-based study of Finns aged 15-30 years</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2014.991342</url>
<snippet>The dominance of computer-mediated communication in the online relational landscape continues to affect millions of users; yet, few studies have identified and analyzed characteristics shared by those specifically valuing its anonymous aspects for self-expression. This article identifies and investigates key characteristics of such users through online survey by two samples of Finnish users of social networking sites aged 15-30 years (n = 1013; 544). Various characteristics espoused by those especially valuing anonymity for self-expression online were identified and analyzed in relation to the users in question. Favoring anonymity was positively correlated with both grandiosity, a component of narcissism, and low self-esteem. In addition, users with stronger anonymity preference tended to be younger, highly trusting, having strong ties to online communities while having few offline friends. Findings emphasize the significance of a deeper understanding of how anonymity effects and attracts users seeking its benefits while also providing new insights into how user characteristics interact depending on motivation.

<title>How Social Networks Influence Human Behavior: An Integrated Latent Space Approach for Differential Social Influence</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11336-023-09934-5</url>
<snippet>How social networks influence human behavior has been an interesting topic in applied research. Existing methods often utilized scale-level behavioral data (e.g., total number of positive responses) to estimate the influence of a social network on human behavior. This study proposes a novel approach to studying social influence that utilizes item-level behavioral measures. Under the latent space modeling framework, we integrate the two latent spaces for respondents' social network data and item-level behavior measures into a single space we call 'interaction map'. The interaction map visualizes the association between the latent homophily among respondents and their item-level behaviors, revealing differential social influence effects across item-level behaviors. We also measure overall social influence by assessing the impact of the interaction map. We evaluate the properties of the proposed approach via extensive simulation studies and demonstrate the proposed approach with a real data in the context of studying how students' friendship network influences their participation in school activities.

<title>What is an "ArchintorTM?" A paradigm shift in teaching, facilitation, and learning: The impact of different types of coursework expectations on classroom network structures</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0288136</url>
<snippet>Hypothetically, a student could attend a class, listen to lectures, and pass the class without knowing or interacting with other students. What happens to the network when the classroom expectations change? For example, there is a coursework expectation that students exchange contact information, or the instructor uses collaborative learning practices. Or what if the principal investigator (PI) of a scientific team goes on a sabbatical? This study uses the framework of classrooms because of their relatability across science. We asked how do different instructor coursework expectations change network structures within a classroom or other learning environments? A social network survey was administered at the start and end of the semester (pre- and post-test) in six university sociology classrooms to explore how expectations impacted the communication and learning networks. We found practical changes in course expectations impact the communication and learning networks, suggesting that instructors, facilitators, and others could be the archintor (TM) (architect+instructor+facilitator) of the network. Understanding that expectations can impact a network's structure marks a paradigm shift in educational assessment approaches. If the archintor (TM) has identified the "optimal" network structure, then their task is to design expectations that result in specific interactions that ultimately improve student achievement and success. This work provides recommendations for classroom archintors (TM) to create the most impactful classroom networks. Future research should extend beyond education and classroom networks and identify the best or desired networks in other areas like public policy, urban planning, and more. If these "optimal" networks were identified, an archintor (TM) could design a social network to solve wicked problems, manage a crisis, and create social change.

<title>Spatial Pattern and Evolution of Global Innovation Network from 2000 to 2019: Global Patent Dataset Perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/5912696</url>
<snippet>In the era of the knowledge economy, the improvement of national innovation systems is playing a significant role in the global entrepreneurship ecosystem. Entrepreneurs are accelerating international intellectual property applications to be competitive. What remains to be explored is the evolution of international intellectual property network in the globe. With the application of social network analysis and intellectual property application database, the global innovation network structure from 2000 to 2019 is explored. Results showed that (1) in the period 2000-2019, the global innovation network has been expanding rapidly from a sparse network to a dense and complex one.

Countries such as the US, China, and Canada have been the top countries flowing in, while Japan, Korea, EU, and Switzerland have been the main countries flowing out. (3) Global innovation network shows an obvious "core-periphery" pattern. The distribution pattern presents a quadrilateral structure with the four core regions of "US, Japan, EU, and China" as the apex.

<title>'Entanglement' - A new dynamic metric to measure team flow</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2021.11.010</url>
<snippet>We introduce "entanglement", a novel metric to measure how synchronized communication between team members is. This measure calculates the Euclidean distance among team members' social network metrics timeseries. We validate the metric with four case studies. The first case study uses entanglement of 11 medical innovation teams to predict team performance and learning behavior. The second case looks at the e-mail communication of 113 senior executives of an international services firm, predicting employee turnover through lack of entanglement of an employee. The third case analyzes the individual employee performance of 81 managers. The fourth case study predicts performance of 13 customer-dedicated teams at a big international company by comparing entanglement in the e-mail interactions with satisfaction of their customers measured through Net Promoter Score (NPS). While we can only speculate about what is causing the entanglement effect, we find that it is a new and versatile indicator for the analysis of employees' communication, analyzing the hitherto underused temporal dimension of online social networks which could be used as a powerful predictor of employee and team performance, employee turnover, and customer satisfaction.

<title>Down and out? the role of household income in students' friendship formation in school-classes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.12.003</url>
<snippet>Research suggests that coming from a lower economic background compromises social integration at school, yet the precise mechanisms underlying this link remain unknown. Therefore, this study examined the effect of household income on friendship network dynamics among classmates in a large sample of Swedish youths (n = 4787 from 235 classes, m age = 14.65, 51&#37; girls, and 33&#37; immigrant background), using multilevel longitudinal social network analysis. Over time, students from poorer households were less often selected as a friend by classmates and they less often initiated or maintained friendship ties than students from higher income households. Furthermore, different conceptualizations of income relative to classmates did not impact friendship formation tendencies. The findings indicate that theories of relative income do not extend understanding of students' friendship formation beyond processes related to absolute income. In addition, this study suggests that the social integration of students from low-income households could be boosted by both promoting their agency in forming friendships and preventing exclusion by classmates.

<title>Social capital and online hate production: A four country survey</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10611-017-9764-5</url>
<snippet>Hateful, threatening or degrading content has become a common part of today's online interactions. However, little is known about the people who produce such content. This study analyzes online hate content production and its associations with cognitive indicators of social capital in both offline and online social networks. The data are derived from American, Finnish, German and British Internet users aged 15-30 (N = 3,565). Measures included questions concerning online hate, social capital and contextual control variables. The results indicate that hate content production is rare overall, despite its high visibility, and is related to social capital in two key ways. First, respondents with high social capital in offline social networks were less likely to produce hate content, and second, high social capital in online networks was associated with a higher probability of production.

<title>Seeing things clearly: social structure, personality, and accuracy in social network perception</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-8733(98)00008-2</url>
<snippet>People differ in their ability to perceive accurately the informal patterns of interpersonal relationships in their social groups, i.e., the group's network structure. Existing research leaves us largely unable to explain the variation in accuracy in social network perception. This paper argues that the study of accuracy in social network perception should consider the effect of both situational factors and individual differences. To explore this claim, three research centers in an Italian university were studied. Perceptions of the friendship and the work-related advice networks in the organization were compared to the actual network. The results indicate that both an observer's position in the formal and informal social structure of the organization, and his or her personality traits contribute to determining accuracy in social network perception.

<snippet>This paper analyzes the spatial dimensions of office layouts in diverse knowledge-intensive workplace environments based on the theoretical and methodological propositions of Space Syntax, and brings this together with the analysis of intra-organizational interaction networks. Physical distances between agents are modeled in different ways and used as explanatory variables in exponential random graph modeling. The paper shows that spatial configuration in offices can be considered an important but not sole rationale for tie formation. Furthermore, it is shown that spatial distance measures based on detailed configurational analysis outperform simple Euclidean distance metrics in predicting social ties. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

<title>Brokerage activity, exclusivity and role diversity: A three-dimensional approach to brokerage in networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.02.014</url>
<snippet>The purpose of this paper is to connect central theoretical contributions to the study of brokerage and propose a novel conceptual and analytical approach for investigating it. On one hand, it builds on, and further substantiate the utility of, the innovation of conceptualizing brokerage activity and brokerage exclusivity separately, whilst analyzing them together. On the other hand, it also builds on the seminal notion of qualitatively different brokerage roles and introduces the conceptual innovation of brokerage role diversity to study the implications of and for actors occupying one or several roles to similar or varying degrees. These implications are further unpacked by analyzing the specific brokerage activity and exclusivity for each brokerage role separately, before reassembling the results into a rich description of the patterns of brokerage among different types of actors. This three-dimensional approach was applied to study brokerage in a network of individual actors governing flood risk mitigation in a catchment area in Southern Sweden. The results suggest that studying these three dimensions of brokerage simultaneously provides a sharper lens that picks up important nuances that available approaches may fail to reveal. The paper makes a substantive contribution to the knowledge of brokerage in collaborative governance of complex issues, as well as a methodological contribution to the study of brokerage in general.

<title>The Evolution of Online Forums as Communication Networks: An Agent-Based Model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3917/rfs.554.0805</url>
<snippet>This article proposes a theoretical and computational model of how people communicate in online discussion forums. The model's analysis shows that two simple mechanisms can account for the complexity of online communication networks, i.e., a) the tendency to talk with already known users, and b) the tendency to engage in Q&amp;A exchanges. These two mechanisms are able to reproduce lengthy discussions as well as complex interactions between users with different levels of expertise. Most notably, when compared to empirical data taken from three different online forums, the model is able to discern when a strong core of users emerges (or not) that interacts more frequently. Since the evolution of a core of stable interacting users might be the first step in building a community's shared feeling, being able to model the emergence of such core is of interest in a broad range of contexts, from policy-making and e-learning to social marketing.

<title>Beauty and social capital: Being attractive shapes social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2017.05.003</url>
<snippet>It is a fact of life that being beautiful is advantageous (Hamermesh, 2011). Whether we consider incomes or the marriage market, the more attractive one is, the better one does. Drawing on psychological research that explains why beauty pays, we hypothesize that more attractive people will exploit social network opportunities differently than less attractive people and, consequently, their networks will comprise more beneficial features. As predicted, results of an experiment showed that more attractive people were more likely to select for themselves more profitable broker positions in networks relative to other positions and relative to less attractive people. Relying on network data supplied by young professionals, in a follow-up study we found that the networks of more attractive people were relatively less dense, as the findings of Study 1 would imply. We discuss the implications for our work as well as highlight the need for further research into an understudied, but potentially influential brokerage contingency factor physical appeal.

<title>Effectiveness of dismantling strategies on moderated vs. unmoderated online social platforms</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71231-3</url>
<snippet>Online social networks are the perfect test bed to better understand large-scale human behavior in interacting contexts. Although they are broadly used and studied, little is known about how their terms of service and posting rules affect the way users interact and information spreads. Acknowledging the relation between network connectivity and functionality, we compare the robustness of two different online social platforms, Twitter and Gab, with respect to banning, or dismantling, strategies based on the recursive censor of users characterized by social prominence (degree) or intensity of inflammatory content (sentiment). We find that the moderated (Twitter) vs. unmoderated (Gab) character of the network is not a discriminating factor for intervention effectiveness. We find, however, that more complex strategies based upon the combination of topological and content features may be effective for network dismantling. Our results provide useful indications to design better strategies for countervailing the production and dissemination of anti-social content in online social platforms.

<title>In-party love spreads more efficiently than out-party hate in online communities</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-65688-9</url>
<snippet>In this article, we present the findings of a comprehensive longitudinal social network analysis conducted on Twitter across four consecutive election campaigns in Spain, spanning from 2015 to 2019. Our focus is on the discernible trend of increasing partisan and ideological homogeneity within interpersonal exchanges on this social media platform, alongside high levels of networking efficiency measured through average retweeting. This diachronic study allows us to observe how dynamics of party competition might contribute to perpetuating and strengthening network ideological and partisan homophily, creating 'epistemic bubbles' in Twitter, yet showing a greater resistance to transforming them into 'partisan echo-chambers.' Specifically, our analysis reveals that the rise of a new radical right-wing party (RRP), Vox, has heightened ideological homogeneity among users across the entire ideological spectrum. However, this process has not been uniform. While users aligned with mainstream political parties consistently share content that reinforces in-party affinity, resulting in highly efficient 'epistemic bubbles,' the emergence of the RRP has given rise to a distinct group of users associated with the most extreme partisan positions, characterized by a notable proportion of out-partisan hostility content, which has fostered the creation of low-efficient 'partisan echo-chambers.'

<title>Judgment about knowledge importance: the roles of social referents and network structure</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0018726708096638</url>
<snippet>As division of labor in a group can often lead to differences in perceptions about the importance of different knowledge bases to a group task, these differences can hinder the integration of different knowledge to solve task problems in a group. This study examines the social referents that group members turn to for judgments about knowledge importance, and the extent to which the relative influence of each referent depends on the group-level social network structure. The findings indicate that group members are more likely to have shared judgments with their cohesive and structurally equivalent referents within their advice network, and the strength of social influence form their cohesive and structurally equivalent referents is likely to depend on the advice network density at the group-level. However, there was no significant association in judgment similarity between group members and their central referents within the advice network. Overall, this study suggests that while social influence (in its most straightforward form) occurs between pairs of individuals, the strength of influence of a social referent is dependent on how social cues are distributed within the group's network structure. Theoretical and managerial implications for research on shared mental models and network theory of social influence are discussed.

<title>The geographic embedding of online echo chambers: Evidence from the Brexit campaign</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0206841</url>
<snippet>This study explores the geographic dependencies of echo-chamber communication on Twitter during the Brexit campaign. We review the evidence positing that online interactions lead to filter bubbles to test whether echo chambers are restricted to online patterns of interaction or are associated with physical, in-person interaction. We identify the location of users, estimate their partisan affiliation, and finally calculate the distance between sender and receiver of @-mentions and retweets. We show that polarized online echo-chambers map onto geographically situated social networks. More specifically, our results reveal that echo chambers in the Leave campaign are associated with geographic proximity and that the reverse relationship holds true for the Remain campaign. The study concludes with a discussion of primary and secondary effects arising from the interaction between existing physical ties and online interactions and argues that the collapsing of distances brought by internet technologies may foreground the role of geography within one's social network.

<title>Element-centric clustering comparison unifies overlaps and hierarchy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-44892-y</url>
<snippet>Clustering is one of the most universal approaches for understanding complex data. A pivotal aspect of clustering analysis is quantitatively comparing clusterings; clustering comparison is the basis for many tasks such as clustering evaluation, consensus clustering, and tracking the temporal evolution of clusters. In particular, the extrinsic evaluation of clustering methods requires comparing the uncovered clusterings to planted clusterings or known metadata. Yet, as we demonstrate, existing clustering comparison measures have critical biases which undermine their usefulness, and no measure accommodates both overlapping and hierarchical clusterings. Here we unify the comparison of disjoint, overlapping, and hierarchically structured clusterings by proposing a new element-centric framework: elements are compared based on the relationships induced by the cluster structure, as opposed to the traditional cluster-centric philosophy. We demonstrate that, in contrast to standard clustering similarity measures, our framework does not suffer from critical biases and naturally provides unique insights into how the clusterings differ. We illustrate the strengths of our framework by revealing new insights into the organization of clusters in two applications: the improved classification of schizophrenia based on the overlapping and hierarchical community structure of fMRI brain networks, and the disentanglement of various social homophily factors in Facebook social networks. The universality of clustering suggests far-reaching impact of our framework throughout all areas of science.

<title>Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320040111</url>
<snippet>Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.

<title>Quantifying Information Flow During Emergencies</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep03997</url>
<snippet>Recent advances on human dynamics have focused on the normal patterns of human activities, with the quantitative understanding of human behavior under extreme events remaining a crucial missing chapter. This has a wide array of potential applications, ranging from emergency response and detection to traffic control and management. Previous studies have shown that human communications are both temporally and spatially localized following the onset of emergencies, indicating that social propagation is a primary means to propagate situational awareness. We study real anomalous events using country-wide mobile phone data, finding that information flow during emergencies is dominated by repeated communications. We further demonstrate that the observed communication patterns cannot be explained by inherent reciprocity in social networks, and are universal across different demographics.

<snippet>Building on a resource theory, this study investigates (a) how individuals' socio-economic status is related to political communication in offline situations and on social networking sites and (b) whether political expression on SNS improves socio-economic stratification in offline political discussion. Analyses of a national survey demonstrate that the impact of individuals' socio-economic status (SES) is much weaker on political expression via SNS than on offline political discussion. It is also found that the political use of SNS reduces the strength of the link between individuals' SES and offline discussion. Implications of these findings for the Internet and political inequality are discussed. (C) 2016 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2019.1610630</url>
<snippet>The present study investigated the way men visually self-present on MSM-specific mobile dating app profiles, as well as the connection between visual self-presentation strategies, demographic variables, and psychosocial attitudes about masculinity and the body. In particular, emphasis was placed on two aspects of men's visual self-presentation: face-disclosure and body-disclosure. Using a selective self-presentation framework, findings indicated that the majority of men presented their face in their profile photo and that nearly one in five presented their unclothed torso. Face-disclosure was connected to higher levels of app usage, longer-term app usage, and levels of outness. The use of shirtless photos was related to age, a higher drive for muscularity, more self-perceived masculinity, and stronger anti-effeminacy attitudes. The findings are discussed in relation to both strategic self-presentation, and the distinct meanings of face and body photos within MSM online culture.

<title>ECOCONFLICTS IN RUSSIA AND DIGITAL NETWORKS PARTICIPATION</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/S013216250005483-4</url>
<snippet>One can observe a growing role of social media, among other things in course of protest actions. That is why researchers begin to speak about emergence of a new type of political participation - that is digital network participation. My study deals with political activists' employment of VKontakte social network, which is the largest social network in Russia, in the course of environmental conflicts. I have analyzed 'digital network participation' (i.e. dissemination of information about a conflict, distribution of information in social networks, and participation in discussions) of these virtual groups members. The analysis showed an active usage of social media in the course of environmental conflicts in contemporary Russia. Activists use virtual groups created during the conflicts for dissemination of information and mobilization of social networks' users. A utilization of virtual groups by activists for mobilization of social networks' users both for online participation (signing online petitions and distribution of information) and for traditional participation (meetings and public hearings) is the focus of the study. At the same time the members of virtual groups demonstrate only mild 'digital network participation'. To a greater extent the group members participate in dissemination of information placed in the group, that is the less cost intensive form of digital network participation. Absolute majority of members of the groups created in the course of local environmental conflicts restricted their activities mainly to joining in virtual groups in social media. The analysis also elucidated that the majority of the group members did not intend to participate in the traditional forms of political activity.

<title>Cognitive cascades: How to model (and potentially counter) the spread of fake news</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261811</url>
<snippet>Understanding the spread of false or dangerous beliefs-often called misinformation or disinformation-through a population has never seemed so urgent. Network science researchers have often taken a page from epidemiologists, and modeled the spread of false beliefs as similar to how a disease spreads through a social network. However, absent from those disease-inspired models is an internal model of an individual's set of current beliefs, where cognitive science has increasingly documented how the interaction between mental models and incoming messages seems to be crucially important for their adoption or rejection. Some computational social science modelers analyze agent-based models where individuals do have simulated cognition, but they often lack the strengths of network science, namely in empirically-driven network structures. We introduce a cognitive cascade model that combines a network science belief cascade approach with an internal cognitive model of the individual agents as in opinion diffusion models as a public opinion diffusion (POD) model, adding media institutions as agents which begin opinion cascades. We show that the model, even with a very simplistic belief function to capture cognitive effects cited in disinformation study (dissonance and exposure), adds expressive power over existing cascade models. We conduct an analysis of the cognitive cascade model with our simple cognitive function across various graph topologies and institutional messaging patterns. We argue from our results that population-level aggregate outcomes of the model qualitatively match what has been reported in COVID-related public opinion polls, and that the model dynamics lend insights as to how to address the spread of problematic beliefs. The overall model sets up a framework with which social science misinformation researchers and computational opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to understand, and hopefully learn how to best counter, the spread of disinformation and "alternative facts."

<title>Residential mobility and the spatial dispersion of personal networks: Effects on social support</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2011.07.003</url>
<snippet>Using a representative national sample of personal networks, this article explores how the spatial dispersion of networks, residential mobility and social support are linked. Three issues will be addressed here. Firstly, how is the spatial dispersion of personal networks related to individuals' social characteristics, network composition and residential mobility? Secondly, how do the spatial dispersion of networks, residential mobility and their combined effect influence the number and (thirdly) the structure of emotional support ties? Results showed that the extent of the support was affected neither by the geographical distribution of the networks nor by residential mobility. Living far from one's birthplace, however, exerted two distinct, and opposite effects on the support network structure. On the one hand, mobility led to high spatial dispersion of personal contacts, which in turn favored a sparsely knit network centered around the mobile individual. On the other hand, by controlling for the effect of distance between the contacts, we found that individuals that cited long-distance ties tended to be part of more transitive support networks than those that cited local ties. We interpreted the latter effect as evidence that transitive ties may survive greater spatial distances than intransitive ones. These findings are discussed in view of spatial mobility and social network research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<title>Information Alienation and Circle Fracture: Policy Communication and Opinion-Generating Networks on Social Media in China from the Perspective of COVID-19 Policy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems11070340</url>
<snippet>The emergence of the Internet and social media provides a new platform for information diffusion, promoting the interaction among relatively independent participants in the opinion market and changing the balance of the intrinsic mechanism and external dynamics based on political communication. In this way, it is necessary to investigate the new interactive landscape of political communication and political discourse regarding digital media. In this study, we conduct a social and semantic network analysis of the dissemination and public opinion generation landscape of the COVID-19 "New Ten Articles" policy communication by the Chinese government, exploring the network relationships and emotional value interactions behind the contact of a new public policy in China. The results show that, in the political communication system, the influence of information's position in the communication field has surpassed the information source impact, and the power of network opinion leaders is significant; the policy communication network presents a situation of "identity status circle" division, and the information circle connection presents a trend of fracture and barrier thickening, which may cause policy information alienation and social opinion polarization risk; the imbalance between policy information supply and public demand is further enhanced, and the negative emotion "cloud" is distributed on a scale and condenses into grassroots social governance pressure; and the content released by some key opinion leaders, experts, online media, and local mainstream media accounts is significantly correlated with network emotions. These emotions continue to spread in subsequent discussions, and to some extent, influence the formation process of political public opinion.

<title>How manufacturing industries connect cities across the world: extending research on 'multiple globalizations'</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/glob.12036</url>
<snippet>In this article, I concentrate on a macro-level analysis of inter-urban linkages in a 'world city network'. Empirical research on the formation of a world city network has mostly concentrated on global service providers. Yet, globally operating manufacturing firms also choose distinct urban regions throughout the world as locational anchoring points. In this article, using social network analysis, I present the first global-scale analysis of how manufacturing firms connected cities across the world (in 2010). To detect the differing 'sectoral profiles' and nodal centralities of cities functioning as geographical hubs of transnational production networks, it is necessary to analyse the network structure of distinct industrial subsectors within the global urban system. The data collected for analysis cover 120 top global firms from three manufacturing subsectors, of which two are analysed in more detail than the third. I then compare the nodal centralities of cities included in these subsectors' global networks with the GaWC research on the producer services sector that has been at the centre of previous analyses of the world city network. The comparison reveals the cities' differing positioning within 'multiple globalizations'. The aim of the article is to extend research on world city networks.

<title>Examining Aspects of Digital Inclusion Among National Samples of US Older Adults</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/si.v11i3.6890</url>
<snippet>We live in a world where we are constantly connected to devices (e.g., smartphones, computers, tablets) and are encouraged to go online to find information about most things in society. This constant digital connection provides the means whereby many individuals communicate and exchange social support. For most demographic groups, this results in being online and connected to devices multiple times each day. Older adults have been slower to adopt and use emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs). Their digital divide in comparison to other age groups may not be an accurate representation of their technology use and the reasons for this use. This descriptive study examines this view of digital inclusion by focusing on older adults and their uses of technology. We provide an overview of technology usage by different older adult age groups in the United States using existing national-level data. We utilize life course and aging theoretical perspectives to help articulate how older adults use a wide variety of ICTs and whether they are constantly connected, and we note that while a constant connection to devices may be normative for younger age groups, this may not, and perhaps should not, be the case for older adults. The article concludes with a discussion of the social construction of digital inclusion and emphasizes the significant variation that exists in this construct, measurement of technology use in large-scale datasets, and variation in technology use across older adult life course groups.

<title>The Social Network: Homeless Young Women, Social Capital, and the Health Implications of Belonging Outside the Nuclear Family</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0044118X12448801</url>
<snippet>This article looks at the means through which homeless young women are able to improve their flow of social capital by attaining a sense of belonging and forming positive attachments to supportive people and places. In so doing, they also develop relationships with health and social services and improve their overall physical and mental health through stable and supportive interactions. In working with homeless youth, however, the very concept of social capital must be adapted to appropriately respond both to their unique social needs and to the less traditional means by which they are able to attain it. Here, the authors explore the ways in which homeless young women are forming attachments and thereby accruing social capital outside of the nuclear family unit: through extended family, service providers, peers, and online social networks.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sdr.1613</url>
<snippet>Across disciplines, there has been an increasing interest in combining different simulation methods. Team science provides a particularly challenging context because of the interplay across levels of analysis. For example, team performance is decisively influenced by accumulated individual attributes, the interactions among individuals and emergent team structures-each of which is affected by multiple feedback loops at different levels of analysis. To address these challenges, we compare the modeling methods of stock-and-flow models, agent-based models and social network analysis to argue for the advantages of a hybrid approach to formal mathematical modeling in a team science context. We develop a proof-of-concept model, which combines aspects of all three methods, to investigate the effects of expertise, the patterns of members' interactions and diversity-based subgroups on team performance. Novel, important insights into team science theory result from this investigation, including, among others, the dynamic tradeoff between diversity and homogeneity on teams' performance and the importance of the communication network structure in affecting that tradeoff.

<title>The strength of a weak tie in the innovative performance of firms: A case of Korean high-tech manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/soc4.13214</url>
<snippet>This study explores whether the 'strength of weak ties' theory, derived from social network theory, can equally apply to business activities. To address this question, we conduct an empirical analysis, utilising 3-year panel data encompassing 3881 samples of Korean small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the high-tech manufacturing sector. The primary objective is to examine the effects of inter-corporate tie strength on innovative performance. The results reveal an interesting pattern in high-tech manufacturing corporations, where the strength of a tie demonstrates an inverted U-shaped relationship with an SME's patent achievement. Moreover, we observe that the effect of tie strength on an SME's patent achievement is positively moderated by its research and development (R&amp;D) intensity. Furthermore, when an SME maintains weak ties within its relationship with a large corporation, its innovative performance experiences a more positive impact than in cases where no relationship with a large corporation exists, or strong ties are maintained. These findings suggest that for SMEs, maintaining an appropriate level of embeddedness with large corporations is an effective strategy for generating sustained innovative performance within an environment characterised by active technological innovation and intense competition. The principal contribution of this paper lies in the empirical validation of the theory of weak ties concerning a firm's innovative performance.

<title>Analyzing gender inequality through large-scale Facebook advertising data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1717781115</url>
<snippet>Online social media are information resources that can have a transformative power in society. While the Web was envisioned as an equalizing force that allows everyone to access information, the digital divide prevents large amounts of people from being present online. Online social media, in particular, are prone to gender inequality, an important issue given the link between social media use and employment. Understanding gender inequality in social media is a challenging task due to the necessity of data sources that can provide large-scale measurements across multiple countries. Here, we show how the Facebook Gender Divide (FGD), a metric based on aggregated statistics of more than 1.4 billion users in 217 countries, explains various aspects of worldwide gender inequality. Our analysis shows that the FGD encodes gender equality indices in education, health, and economic opportunity. We find gender differences in network externalities that suggest that using social media has an added value for women. Furthermore, we find that low values of the FGD are associated with increases in economic gender equality. Our results suggest that online social networks, while suffering evident gender imbalance, may lower the barriers that women have to access to informational resources and help to narrow the economic gender gap.

<title>The ties that bind global governance: Using media-reported events to disentangle the global interorganizational network in a global pandemic</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.02.012</url>
<snippet>This article disentangles the global interorganizational network by analyzing the ties of international actors comprising multinational companies, intergovernmental organizations, and international nongovernmental organizations. The onset of COVID-19 is a rare opportunity to explore how this network has evolved in an exogenous event. Using a unique GDELT big dataset of events reported by the world's media, we extract and analyze the interorganizational interactions of international actors before and after the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the COVID-19 outbreak was a public health emergency of international concern. Adopting an exploratory and descriptive approach at multiple levels of analysis, we draw on the theory of networks to uncover the fragmented, polycentric, and complex characteristics of the global interorganizational network. Our study highlights the use of media-reported events and the Goldstein scale as means to unpack the difficult-to-capture relational dynamics of international actors, which can help in theory development of the global interorganizational network that is crucial for collective action to address societal grand challenges.

<title>Resource sharing in technologically defined social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08935-2</url>
<snippet>Technologically enabled sharing-economy networks are changing the way humans trade and collaborate. Here, using a novel 'Wi-Fi sharing' game, we explored determinants of human sharing strategy. Subjects (N = 1,950) participated in a networked game in which they could choose how to allocate a limited, but personally not usable, resource (representing unused Wi-Fi bandwidth) to immediate network neighbors. We first embedded N = 600 subjects into 30 networks, experimentally manipulating the range over which subjects could connect. We find that denser networks decrease any wealth inequality, but that this effect saturates. Individuals' benefit is shaped by their network position, with having many partners who in turn have few partners being especially beneficial. We propose a new, simplified "sharing centrality" metric for quantifying this. Further experiments (N = 1,200) confirm the robustness of the effect of network structure on sharing behavior. Our findings suggest the possibility of interventions to help more evenly distribute shared resources over networks.

<title>Identifying target areas for risk-based surveillance and control of transboundary animal diseases: a seasonal analysis of slaughter and live-trade cattle movements in Uganda</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-44518-4</url>
<snippet>Animal movements are a major driver for the spread of Transboundary Animal Diseases (TADs). These movements link populations that would otherwise be isolated and hence create opportunities for susceptible and infected individuals to meet. We used social network analysis to describe the seasonal network structure of cattle movements in Uganda and unravel critical network features that identify districts or sub-regions for targeted risk-based surveillance and intervention. We constructed weighted, directed networks based on 2019 between-district cattle movements using official livestock mobility data; the purpose of the movement ('slaughter' vs. 'live trade') was used to subset the network and capture the risks more reliably. Our results show that cattle trade can result in local and long-distance disease spread in Uganda. Seasonal variability appears to impact the structure of the network, with high heterogeneity of node and edge activity identified throughout the seasons. These observations mean that the structure of the live trade network can be exploited to target influential district hubs within the cattle corridor and peripheral areas in the south and west, which would result in rapid network fragmentation, reducing the contact structure-related trade risks. Similar exploitable features were observed for the slaughter network, where cattle traffic serves mainly slaughter hubs close to urban centres along the cattle corridor. Critically, analyses that target the complex livestock supply value chain offer a unique framework for understanding and quantifying risks for TADs such as Foot-and-Mouth disease in a land-locked country like Uganda. These findings can be used to inform the development of risk-based surveillance strategies and decision making on resource allocation. For instance, vaccine deployment, biosecurity enforcement and capacity building for stakeholders at the local community and across animal health services with the potential to limit the socio-economic impact of outbreaks, or indeed reduce their frequency.

<title>Short- and long-term stability in organizational networks: Temporal structures of project teams</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2013.07.001</url>
<snippet>Network research focuses on patterns of stable relationships, where stability represents the unfolding of social processes over long time frames. We argue that social interactions exhibit important regularities in different time frames (short and long term), reflecting distinct social processes. We illustrate the value of this distinction through a comparative case study of technology-mediated communication, within two project teams in a digital marketing agency. We examine how the embedding of interpersonal interactions in processes of reciprocity and closure over different time horizons enables the emergence of cohesion in the face of constant compositional changes. We propose that the time frames in which stable patterns of interactions develop are the key to understanding the nature of the underlying social processes with short-term patterns of closure and reciprocity representing adaptation to change while longer term patterns indicate cohesion. Our results are supportive of this argument and show that the two teams exhibit the same regularities in interactions but across different time horizons. We discuss the implication of our findings and argue that distinguishing between short- and long-term stability of social networks offers a novel and promising avenue for network research.

<title>The effects of peer group network properties on drug use among homeless youth</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764204274194</url>
<snippet>The authors examine how the properties of peer networks affect amphetamine, cocaine, and injection drug use over 3 months among newly homeless adolescents, aged 12 to 20 in Los Angeles (n = 217; 83&#37; retention at 3 months) and Melbourne (n = 119; 72&#37; retention at 3 months). Several hypotheses regarding the effects of social network properties on the peer influence process are developed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses show that higher concentrations of homeless peers in networks at recruitment were associated with increased likelihood of amphetamine and cocaine use at 3-month follow-up. Higher concentrations of injecting peers were associated with increased risk of injection drug use 3 months later Change in network structure over time toward increased concentrations of homeless peers was associated with increased risk of cocaine use and injecting. Higher density networks at baseline were positively associated with increased likelihood of cocaine and amphetamine use at 3 months.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2024.08.007</url>
<snippet>The present empirical study aims to explore medical knowledge sharing in the Australian healthcare context, aiming to broadly evaluate the potential impact of Project ECHO (R), (R), an online mentoring and networking health program. We focus on health-related knowledge sharing practices among the network of professionals through formal and informal channels, and across different health and non-health sectors and organisational systems. Studying knowledge transmission among professional networks is essential for optimizing healthcare delivery, promoting innovation, and providing insights on improvement of patient experiences within the healthcare system. We utilize a multilevel approach to shape our data collection strategy. Employing network measures and Multilevel Exponential Random Graph Models, we aim to explore how advice and knowledge sharing behaviours among healthcare professionals and their institutions are interdependently connected. Then, we incorporate network generated results within an evaluation framework for establishing some aspects of the efficiency of the ECHO program along four pillars: Acceptability, , Capability, , Reachability, , and Integration. . Our investigation found that among ECHO members, hierarchy is less pronounced compared to across levels and organizations, with certain individuals emerging as central in advice-sharing. The multilevel network perspective showed complex, informal patterns of knowledge and information sharing, including inter-organizational hierarchy, role and sector homophily, brokerage roles with popularity across health organizations, and connectivity through knowledge-sharing in cross-level small group clusters.

<title>WORK RELATIONSHIPS AND MEDIA USE - A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01384688</url>
<snippet>Our research provided empirical evidence about the alternative means of communication used by 25 members of a research group who had available to them:  unscheduled face-to-face encounters, scheduled face-to-face meetings, electronic mail, telephone, fax, and desktop videoconferencing.  The intent of our research is to learn whether there are elements in existing group communication patterns that suggest how future communication systems can be designed or selected to fit the actual work relationships of a group.  A detailed social network survey provided information about what members of the group communicated about, how they communicated, and with whom they communicated.  Most communication was done through a combination of media, but predominately through unscheduled encounters, electronic mail, and scheduled meetings; people rarely videoconferenced, telephoned, or faxed.  Factor analysis reduced the 24 work relationships to six distinct dimensions:  receiving work, giving work, collaborative writing, major emotional support, sociability, and computer programming.  The proportion in which the three main media were used varied according to the nature of the work dimension.  Our findings suggest that a multivariate perspective that considers group norms and practices, social networks, and work dimensions is necessary to analyze media use.

<title>Health and science-related disinformation on COVID-19: A content analysis of hoaxes identified by fact-checkers in Spain</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265995</url>
<snippet>A massive "infodemic" developed in parallel with the global COVID-19 pandemic and contributed to public misinformation at a time when access to quality information was crucial. This research aimed to analyze the science and health-related hoaxes that were spread during the pandemic with the objectives of (1) identifying the characteristics of the form and content of such false information, and the platforms used to spread them, and (2) formulating a typology that can be used to classify the different types of hoaxes according to their connection with scientific information. The study was conducted by analyzing the content of hoaxes which were debunked by the three main fact-checking organizations in Spain in the three months following WHO's announcement of the pandemic (N = 533). The results indicated that science and health content played a prominent role in shaping the spread of these hoaxes during the pandemic. The most common hoaxes on science and health involved information on scientific research or health management, used text, were based on deception, used real sources, were international in scope, and were spread through social networks. Based on the analysis, we proposed a system for classifying science and health-related hoaxes, and identified four types according to their connection to scientific knowledge: "hasty" science, decontextualized science, badly interpreted science, and falsehood without a scientific basis. The rampant propagation and widespread availability of disinformation point to the need to foster media and scientific caution and literacy among the public and increase awareness of the importance of timing and substantiation of scientific research. The results can be useful in improving media literacy to face disinformation, and the typology we formulate can help develop future systems for automated detection of health and science-related hoaxes.

<title>Entrepreneurial orientation and innovation performance: the mediating effect of social network ambidexterity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2023.2172567</url>
<snippet>The aim of this study is to adopt the perspective of organisational ambidexterity to explore the relationships between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and innovation performance (IP). Based on the resource-based view and social network theory, this study constructs a theoretical model to investigate the relationship between EO and IP, as well as the mediation of network ambidexterity. The empirical results show that EO has a positive and direct impact on IP. The dimensions of network ambidexterity both mediate the relationships between EO and IP. More importantly, the combined dimension has a stronger effect than the balance.

<title>The dynamics of health behavior sentiments on a large online social network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds16</url>
<snippet>Modifiable health behaviors, a leading cause of illness and death in many countries, are often driven by individual beliefs and sentiments about health and disease. Individual behaviors affecting health outcomes are increasingly modulated by social networks, for example through the associations of like-minded individuals homophily - or through peer influence effects. Using a statistical approach to measure the individual temporal effects of a large number of variables pertaining to social network statistics, we investigate the spread of a health sentiment towards a new vaccine on Twitter, a large online social network. We find that the effects of neighborhood size and exposure intensity are qualitatively very different depending on the type of sentiment. Generally, we find that larger numbers of opinionated neighbors inhibit the expression of sentiments. We also find that exposure to negative sentiment is contagious - by which we merely mean predictive of future negative sentiment expression - while exposure to positive sentiments is generally not. In fact, exposure to positive sentiments can even predict increased negative sentiment expression. Our results suggest that the effects of peer influence and social contagion on the dynamics of behavioral spread on social networks are strongly content-dependent.

<title>Do Women Suffer from Network Closure? The Moderating Effect of Social Capital on Gender Inequality in a Project-Based Labor Market, 1929 to 2010</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122414568788</url>
<snippet>That social capital matters is an established fact in the social sciences. Less clear, however, is how different forms of social capital affect gender disadvantages in career advancement. Focusing on a project-based type of labor market, namely the U.S. film industry, this study argues that women suffer a "closure penalty" and face severe career disadvantages when collaborating in cohesive teams. At the same time, gender disadvantages are reduced for women who build social capital in open networks with higher degrees of diversity and information flow. Using large-scale longitudinal data on career profiles of about one million performances by 97,657 film actors in 369,099 film productions between the years 1929 and 2010, I analyze career survival models and interaction effects between gender and different measures of social capital and information openness. Findings reveal that female actors have a higher risk of career failure than do their male colleagues when affiliated in cohesive networks, but women have better survival chances when embedded in open, diverse structures. This study contributes to the understanding of how and what type of social capital can be either a beneficial resource for otherwise disadvantaged groups or a constraining mechanism that intensifies gender differences in career advancement.

<snippet>The article analyses the role of religious brokerage, arguing for the importance of cultural and social capital. A city like Barcelona is a place of arrival and settlement for a population with diverse trajectories. We see the urban environment as a cultural as well as a social attribute of the activity of religious brokerage. Our case studies are three religious communities in the city: Muslim Pakistani, Sikh and Philippine Catholic. Based on research using a mixed methodology, combining semi-structured interviews, observation and social network analysis (SNA), we look at the spaces where mediation occurs and the composition of the mediators' personal networks. The results obtained lead us to consider sense of place and sociability as necessary aspects of religious brokerage.

<title>Online News Media Analysis on Information Management of "G20 Summit" Based on Social Network Analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems11060290</url>
<snippet>This paper contributes to the Special Issue on Communication for the Digital Media Age by investigating the factors that influence the management of political information on online news media platforms, specifically Twitter and Weibo. Using the recent "G20 Summit" as a case study, this study employs a mixed-methods approach that incorporates both deductive and inductive reasoning. Social network analysis (SNA) and graph theory are used to evaluate specific social relationships in the context of the G20 summit, while a combination of structured and content (semantic) analysis is performed. The findings indicate that individual power is becoming increasingly important in the age of online news media. Individuals contribute significantly to the diffusion of information and may play a decisive role in the future. The study also finds that the frequency of retweets increases as the reciprocity ratio increases, and mentions may be the most effective method for delivering political news on online news media platforms. Practical implications suggest strategies for managing information diffusion effectively. Additionally, this study provides insights into effective information diffusion on online news media platforms that can be utilized in health communication management during the COVID-19 era. This study expands theoretical understanding by investigating the role of individual power in the age of online news media and enriching the literature on online news media through the use of structured and content analysis based on social network analysis.

<title>Endogenetic structure of filter bubble in social networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.190868</url>
<snippet>The filter bubble is an intermediate structure to provoke polarization and echo chambers in social networks, and it has become one of today's most urgent issues for social media. Previous studies usually equated filter bubbles with community structures and emphasized this exogenous isolation effect, but there is a lack of full discussion of the internal organization of filter bubbles. Here, we design an experiment for analysing filter bubbles taking advantage of social bots. We deployed 128 bots to Weibo (the largest microblogging network in China), and each bot consumed a specific topic (entertainment or sci-tech) and ran for at least two months. In total, we recorded about 1.3 million messages exposed to these bots and their social networks. By analysing the text received by the bots and motifs in their social networks, we found that a filter bubble is not only a dense community of users with the same preferences but also presents an endogenetic unidirectional star-like structure. The structure could spontaneously exclude non-preferred information and cause polarization. Moreover, our work proved that the felicitous use of artificial intelligence technology could provide a useful experimental approach that combines privacy protection and controllability in studying social media.

<title>Depolarization of echo chambers by random dynamical nudge</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12494-w</url>
<snippet>In social networks, users often engage with like-minded peers. This selective exposure to opinions might result in echo chambers, i.e., political fragmentation and social polarization of user interactions. When echo chambers form, opinions have a bimodal distribution with two peaks on opposite sides. In certain issues, where either extreme positions contain a degree of misinformation, neutral consensus is preferable for promoting discourse. In this paper, we use an opinion dynamics model that naturally forms echo chambers in order to find a feedback mechanism that bridges these communities and leads to a neutral consensus. We introduce the random dynamical nudge (RDN), which presents each agent with input from a random selection of other agents' opinions and does not require surveillance of every person's opinions. Our computational results in two different models suggest that the RDN leads to a unimodal distribution of opinions centered around the neutral consensus. Furthermore, the RDN is effective both for preventing the formation of echo chambers and also for depolarizing existing echo chambers. Due to the simple and robust nature of the RDN, social media networks might be able to implement a version of this self-feedback mechanism, when appropriate, to prevent the segregation of online communities on complex social issues.

<title>Post-merger cultural integration from a social network perspective: a computational modeling approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10588-012-9139-5</url>
<snippet>Although cultural integration, or sharing a common corporate culture, is crucial for the success of mergers, previous studies have been limited to firm-level analyses. From a social network perspective, this study explores how cultural integration emerges from the patterns of social interactions among individuals. Using an agent-based model, we investigate the impact of network structures within and between two merging firms on post-merger cultural integration and organizational dysfunctions-individual turnover, interpersonal conflict and organizational communication ineffectiveness-that arise from insufficient cultural integration. The simulation results demonstrate that the highest level of cultural integration is achieved when social ties are more centralized within each merging firm and the social ties between the merging firms are less concentrated on central individuals. Additionally, the results show that within-firm and between-firm network structures significantly affect individual turnover, interpersonal conflict and organizational communication ineffectiveness, and that these three outcome measurements do not vary in tandem.

<title>Climate-Change Communication Within Public Natural Resource Agencies: Lessons Learned From the US Forest Service</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2015.1107790</url>
<snippet>By analyzing interview and survey data from U.S. Forest Service employees, we examined the strategies used for communicating about climate change within the agency and their effectiveness from the perspective of agency employees. We found a limited awareness among employees regarding climate policy. We found that horizontal information flow through informal social networks was an important way in which climate-change information was communicated. We also found a lack of confidence among employees in their ability to provide feedback to agency leadership. Our results suggest that (1) agency leadership's ability to set priorities and deliver positive vision is important for increasing employee awareness and inspiring actions, (2) the agency could play a role in facilitating formal and informal networking among employees, and (3) using advanced information technologies may contribute to information flow horizontally and vertically, formally and informally.

<snippet>Large-scale protests occur frequently and sometimes overthrow entire political systems. Meanwhile, online social networks have become an increasingly common component of people's lives. We present a large-scale longitudinal study that connects online social media behaviors to offline protest. Using almost 14 million geolocated tweets and data on protests from 16 countries during the Arab Spring, we show that increased coordination of messages on Twitter using specific hashtags is associated with increased protests the following day. The results also show that traditional actors like the media and elites are not driving the results. These results indicate social media activity correlates with subsequent large-scale decentralized coordination of protests, with important implications for the future balance of power between citizens and their states.

<title>Context collapse: theorizing context collusions and collisions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2014.888458</url>
<snippet>The collapsing of social contexts together has emerged as an important topic with the rise of social media that so often blurs the public and private, professional and personal, and the many different selves and situations in which individuals find themselves. Academic literature is starting to address how the meshing of social contexts online has many potentially beneficial as well as problematic consequences. In an effort to further theorize context collapse, we draw on this literature to consider the conditions under which context collapse occurs, offering key conceptual tools with which to address these conditions. Specifically, we distinguish two different types of context collapse, splitting collapse into context collusions and context collisions. The former is an intentional collapsing of contexts, while the latter is unintentional. We further examine the ways in which both technological architectures and agentic user practices combine to facilitate and mitigate the various effects of collapsing contexts.

<title>Not all brokers are alike: Creative implications of brokering networks in different work functions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0018726716672921</url>
<snippet>Brokers are expected to be more creative than employees embedded in closed social structures because they occupy a position in the social space that provides them with access to non-redundant knowledge. However, the extant research provides partly inconsistent findings on the creative implications of brokerage, which raises important questions about when and how brokering between otherwise disconnected colleagues leads to individual creativity. We advance the relational perspective on individual creativity by adopting a contingency view, and showing that a curvilinear ( inverted U-shape) specification of the relationship between brokerage and creativity applies particularly when brokers work in research and development, as they are more likely to intensively exploit their structural opportunities. In addition, we show that brokers who work in research and development are more sensitive to work environments that protect their cognitive resources, such that they exhibit greater creativity when the work environment is free from environmental stressors, such as noise and disturbances. Thus, environmental stressors are particularly harmful for those employees who are most likely to exploit the opportunity to broker across otherwise disconnected colleagues.

This study aims to answer fundamental questions regarding youths' use of smartphones, by implementing a novel user-centric research method. The smartphone use of 114 emerging adults was recorded, followed by in-depth interviews that incorporated the recording and in-app information to help participants recall their behaviours, motivations, and feelings. Results indicate that smartphone use is indeed ubiquitous; 88 out of 114 participants started using their smartphone as soon as they were left alone. However, the findings of this study also demonstrate great diversity in smartphone use, in e.g. social media platforms used and motivations for using different apps. These results illustrate that it no longer seems sensible to refer to "screen time" as if it represents a homogeneous phenomenon across youth. Additionally, preliminary indications have been found of relationships between individual differences in mental health indices and variations in smartphone use. The current study provides new insights into youths' smartphone use and its relationship with wellbeing.

<title>Sensitivity Analysis for Contagion Effects in Social Networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0049124111404821</url>
<snippet>Analyses of social network data have suggested that obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness all travel through social networks. Individuals exert "contagion effects'' on one another through social ties and association. These analyses have come under critique because of the possibility that homophily from unmeasured factors may explain these statistical associations and because similar findings can be obtained when the same methodology is applied to height, acne, and headaches, for which the conclusion of contagion effects seems somewhat less plausible. The author uses sensitivity analysis techniques to assess the extent to which supposed contagion effects for obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness might be explained away by homophily or confounding and the extent to which the critique using analysis of data on height, acne, and headaches is relevant. Sensitivity analyses suggest that contagion effects for obesity and smoking cessation are reasonably robust to possible latent homophily or environmental confounding; those for happiness and loneliness are somewhat less so. Supposed effects for height, acne, and headaches are all easily explained away by latent homophily and confounding. The methodology that has been used in past studies for contagion effects in social networks, when used in conjunction with sensitivity analysis, may prove useful in establishing social influence for various behaviors and states. The sensitivity analysis approach can be used to address the critique of latent homophily as a possible explanation of associations interpreted as contagion effects.

<title>ISBP: Understanding the Security Rule of Users' Information-Sharing Behaviors in Partnership</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0151002</url>
<snippet>The rapid growth of social network data has given rise to high security awareness among users, especially when they exchange and share their personal information. However, because users have different feelings about sharing their information, they are often puzzled about who their partners for exchanging information can be and what information they can share. Is it possible to assist users in forming a partnership network in which they can exchange and share information with little worry? We propose a modified information sharing behavior prediction (ISBP) model that can help in understanding the underlying rules by which users share their information with partners in light of three common aspects: what types of items users are likely to share, what characteristics of users make them likely to share information, and what features of users' sharing behavior are easy to predict. This model is applied with machine learning techniques in WEKA to predict users' decisions pertaining to information sharing behavior and form them into trustable partnership networks by learning their features. In the experiment section, by using two real-life datasets consisting of citizens' sharing behavior, we identify the effect of highly sensitive requests on sharing behavior adjacent to individual variables: the younger participants' partners are more difficult to predict than those of the older participants, whereas the partners of people who are not computer majors are easier to predict than those of people who are computer majors. Based on these findings, we believe that it is necessary and feasible to offer users personalized suggestions on information sharing decisions, and this is pioneering work that could benefit college researchers focusing on user-centric strategies and website owners who want to collect more user information without raising their privacy awareness or losing their trustworthiness.

<title>Understanding information propagation on online social tagging systems: a case study on Flickr</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-012-9799-8</url>
<snippet>Online social networking services (SNS) have been regarded as one of the most powerful online communication channels to propagate information to other users. It means that the online social networking services are providing users with efficient features (e.g., searching, managing and visualizing new information). It is important for many online collaborative applications to understand how the information can be propagated via such social media. Thus, we want to focus on a social tagging system (e.g., Flickr) where users can easily exchange resources as well as their tags. In this paper, given a certain tag, a social pulse can be established by counting (i) the number of users and (ii) the number of resources over time. More importantly, we assume that information can be propagated by (iii) inducibility from other tags by comparing social pulses. To conduct experimentation, a tag-based searching system (called Tagoole) has been implemented to collect a dataset from Flickr.

<title>Investigating social media's impact on the new era of interactive learning: A case study of Bangladesh</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e26234</url>
<snippet>This study aims to clarify how social media and smart devices affect the modern interactive learning process, particularly in Bangladesh, a South Asian nation. Several hypotheses have been formulated to support the notion that social media and digital gadgets have a favorable impact on interactive learning. These hypotheses were evaluated by surveying students to gauge their perceptions. This in-depth study uses data from an online survey administered to 350 students at various universities in Bangladesh to inquire into the ways in which these students make use of mobile devices like smartphones, laptops etc. and social media platforms to enhance their learning in an interactive manner, with their instructors, and amongst themselves. The examination and instrument validation techniques used an indirect structural equation model. The research found that students' interactions with their peers and teachers, as well as their tendency to share what they've learned online, were all significantly influenced by their participation in group efforts via online social networking. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that students' interactions with instructors, peers, and online information-sharing practices greatly impact student engagement, which impacts academic achievement. This study's findings suggest that students who work together to learn on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are more likely to be creative, motivated, as well as committed to academic exploration.

<title>Compressing strongly connected subgroups in social networks: An entropy-based approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2017.1284070</url>
<snippet>To detect and study cohesive subgroups of actors is a main objective in social network analysis. What are the respective relations inside such groups and what separates them from the outside. Entropy-based analysis of network structures is an up-and-coming approach. It turns out to be a powerful instrument to detect certain forms of cohesive subgroups and to compress them to superactors without loss of information about their embeddedness in the net: Compressing strongly connected subgroups leaves the whole net's and the (super-)actors' information theoretical indices unchanged; i.e., such compression is information-invariant. The actual article relates on the reduction of networks with hundreds of actors. All entropy-based calculations are realized in an expert system shell.

<title>The strengths of close ties: Taiwanese online entrepreneurship, gender and intersectionality</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1069873</url>
<snippet>This article examines entrepreneurs who have started innovative Internet and mobile technology companies in Taiwan because they are at the forefront of industrial changes in the country. Similar to findings in Europe and the USA, education and careers in technology in Taiwan remain dominated by men. However, I argue that the gender inequality of the sector is partly the result of the fact that small new enterprises rely on family support and close social networks. Few women are able to join the sector with male friends and colleagues due to the close social ties of the founding teams (homophily). Among my female interviewees, half have started their nascent companies with their husbands and male partners (husband and wife teams). However, gender, family backgrounds and childcare responsibilities affect both men and women, and the interviewees in my study were open in discussing these personal factors in relation to being entrepreneurs. This article argues that starting an Internet company is a family decision, discussed within the household. Intersectionality, not only gender, explains the founders' decision to start a company, and their choice of co-founders.

<title>Socio-economic segregation in a population-scale social network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2024.02.005</url>
<snippet>We propose a social network -aware approach to study socio-economic segregation. The key question that we address is whether patterns of segregation are more pronounced in social networks than in the common spatial neighborhood -focused manifestations of segregation. We, therefore, conduct a population -scale social network analysis to study socio-economic segregation at a comprehensive and highly granular social network level. For this, we utilize social network data from Statistics Netherlands on 17.2 million registered residents of the Netherlands that are connected through around 1.3 billion ties distributed over five distinct tie types. We take income assortativity as a measure of socio-economic segregation, compare a social network and spatial neighborhood approach, and find that the social network structure exhibits two times as much segregation. As such, this work complements the spatial perspective on segregation in both literature and policymaking. While at a widely used unit of spatial aggregation (e.g., the geographical neighborhood), patterns of socioeconomic segregation may appear relatively minimal, they may in fact persist in the underlying social network structure. Furthermore, we discover higher social network segregation in larger cities, shedding a different light on the common view of cities as hubs for diverse socio-economic mixing. A population -scale social network perspective hence offers a way to uncover hitherto "hidden"segregation that extends beyond spatial neighborhoods and infiltrates multiple aspects of human life.

<title>It Takes a Village: A Social Network Approach to NGOs' International Public Engagement</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764219835265</url>
<snippet>Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), like most strategic communicators, are challenged with breaking through the saturated international media environment as they attempt to influence public opinion. Yet, before strategic communicators can build an agenda, they must get attention from the public. The current study examined how NGOs' network positions in the public Twitter discussion of the global refugee crisis influenced the public engagement NGOs received during two news events. Drawing from network theory and research, we posed two parallel sets of hypotheses. First, we predicted that NGOs with characteristics of "star" network structures will be well-situated in the network to garner attention. Second, we hypothesized that the "village" around an NGO also contributes to capturing attention. The results from our regressions offer evidence to support both hypotheses.

<title>The structure of risk-sharing networks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00181-021-02037-z</url>
<snippet>We examine the structure of risk-sharing networks in developing countries using data from the Tanzanian village of Nyakatoke. We first show that the Nyakatoke network exhibits: (1) the "small-world" phenomenon, where two households who are not themselves risk-sharing partners are separated only by a short chain of intermediaries; (2) preferential attachment, which is a network formation process where the probability of a household receiving a partner is proportional to that household's existing number of partners; and (3) assortative mixing, as similarly connected households tend to link to each other. We then examine the implications of these features for network performance by comparing the Nyakatoke network to simulated networks with alternative structural traits. Our simulations show that the Nyakatoke network displays optimal or near-optimal performance along multiple dimensions. In particular, the Nyakatoke network has a notable ability to withstand perturbations of multiple types, a property that none of the counterfactual networks possess.

<title>The role of online social networking sites in facilitating friendships and adaptation among international students in Malaysia</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2024.101942</url>
<snippet>The emergence of social networking sites (SNS) has reshaped how international students establish crucial connections to support their study abroad. While existing studies have theorised the process of adaptation, there exists a notable gap in understanding the role of technology -mediated communication in student sojourners' acculturation, particularly in non-western contexts. This qualitative study thus explores the role of SNS in facilitating international students' friendships and adaptation, using an Online Community of Practice (OCoP) lens. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 18 international students from a Malaysian higher education institution, supplemented by observations and participants' reflective notes. Findings highlight the importance of online communities in shaping socialisation and fostering adaptation among newcomers. This was achieved through creating a co -national supportive community, establishing friendly relationships with locals, overcoming barriers to connecting with international peers, engaging in intercultural communication, and accessing information and support. The study advances understanding of how SNS can be incorporated into the co -creation of a culturally safe learning environment that facilitates friendships and cross-cultural adaptation. The study has theoretical implications, in regard both to the application of OCoP and to previous research on the crosscultural adaptation of international students; it also has practical implications for the transition of newcomers into a host society.

<title>The distribution of initial estimates moderates the effect of social influence on the wisdom of the crowd</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20551-7</url>
<snippet>Whether, and under what conditions, groups exhibit "crowd wisdom" has been a major focus of research across the social and computational sciences. Much of this work has focused on the role of social influence in promoting the wisdom of the crowd versus leading the crowd astray and has resulted in conflicting conclusions about how social network structure determines the impact of social influence. Here, we demonstrate that it is not enough to consider the network structure in isolation. Using theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and reanalysis of four experimental datasets (totaling 2885 human subjects), we find that the wisdom of crowds critically depends on the interaction between (i) the centralization of the social influence network and (ii) the distribution of the initial individual estimates. By adopting a framework that integrates both the structure of the social influence and the distribution of the initial estimates, we bring previously conflicting results under one theoretical framework and clarify the effects of social influence on the wisdom of crowds.

<title>Environmental disturbance increases social connectivity in a passerine bird</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183144</url>
<snippet>Individual level response to natural and anthropogenic disturbance represents an increasingly important, but as yet little understood, component of animal behavior. Disturbance events often alter habitat, which in turn can modify behaviors of individuals in affected areas, including changes in habitat use and associated changes in social structure. To better understand these relationships, we investigated aspects of habitat selection and social connectivity of a small passerine bird, the red-backed fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus), before vs. after naturally occurring fire disturbance in Northern Territory, Australia. We utilized a social network framework to evaluate changes in social dynamics pre-vs. post-fire. Our study covered the non-breeding season in two consecutive years in which fires occurred, and individuals whose habitat was affected and those that were not affected by fire. Individuals in habitat affected by fires had stronger social ties (i.e. higher weighted degree) after fires, while those that were in areas that were not affected by fire actually had lower weighted degree. We suggest that this change in social connections may be linked to habitat. Before fires, fairywrens used habitat that had similar grass cover to available habitat plots randomly generated within our study site. Fire caused a reduction in grass cover, and fairywrens responded by selecting habitat with higher grass cover relative to random plots. This study demonstrates how changes in habitat and/or resource availability caused by disturbance can lead to substantive changes in the social environment that individuals experience.

<title>The New Frontier of Digital Inequality. The Participatory Divide</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.5477/cis/reis.156.97</url>
<snippet>This article focuses on the relationship between digital participation and the digital participation divide. The first concept refers to the use of the Internet to produce cultural goods that are subsequently shared on a global scale; the latter, refers to the inequalities generated by the uneven distribution of these creative uses of the Internet in a given population. Empirically, our work focuses on the role of digital skills and sociopolitical attitudes toward the Internet in explaining the digital participation divide, as they are considered precursors of digital participation. Results suggest that the same mechanisms that previously sustained digital divide are now fostering digital participation divide; however, we argue that the negative social consequences of this divide exceed those of its predecessor.

<title>Cooperative Networks: Altruism, Group Solidarity, Reciprocity, and Sanctioning in Ugandan Producer Organizations</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/682418</url>
<snippet>Repeated interaction and social networks are commonly considered viable solutions to collective action problems. This article identifies and systematically measures four general mechanismsthat is, generalized altruism, group solidarity, reciprocity, and the threat of sanctioningand tests which of them brings about cooperation in the context of Ugandan producer organizations. Using an innovative methodological framework that combines lab-in-the-field experiments with survey interviews and complete social networks data, the article goes beyond the assessment of a relationship between social networks and collective outcomes to study the mechanisms that favor cooperative behavior. The article first establishes a positive relationship between position in the network structure and propensity to cooperate in the producer organization and then uses farmers' behavior in dictator and public goods games to test different mechanisms that may account for such a relationship. Results show that cooperation is induced by patterns of reciprocity that emerge through repeated interaction rather than other-regarding preferences like altruism or group solidarity.

<title>Airbnb on TikTok: Brand Perception Through User Engagement and Sentiment Trends</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08944393241260242</url>
<snippet>This study delves into Airbnb's brand presence on TikTok by analyzing textual content in posts, and human audio in videos. This approach aims to decipher the brand narrative and gauge user engagement. In the dynamic realm of social media marketing, TikTok has emerged as a key platform in shaping brand perception. This research specifically concentrates on Airbnb's content, distinguishing between official narratives and user-generated content (UGC). Notably, themes of "Travel" dominate official posts, contrasting with "Real Estate" and "Business" in UGC. The methodology employed involves advanced data collection techniques, including web scraping for textual data and artificial intelligence for transcribing human audio to text. The findings reveal that UGC commands greater engagement and volume compared to Airbnb's own brand content, underscoring the increasing significance of user involvement in brand storytelling. An analysis of the study results is conducted using linguistic natural processing (LNP) for the sentiment base, and the vector space model for emotion analysis. Sentiment analysis reveals a predominance of the emotion "happiness" and a significant presence of "surprise" in the posts, both of which are critical for audience engagement. Moreover, the study indicates a high approval rate for Airbnb-related content, reflecting a positive reception of the brand. Additionally, the research observes that influencers, particularly nano influencers, have higher engagement rates, indicating that their authenticity and relatability appeal especially to Generation Z audiences. This study not only sheds light on the intricate relationship between brand narrative, user engagement, and sentiment on TikTok but also offers valuable insights into effective brand image construction and propagation in the digital era, highlighting the importance of diverse emotions in enhancing audience engagement.

<snippet>We consider linked lives through the Convoy Model of Social Relations to illustrate their complexity, consequences, and development across contexts. To illustrate how the Convoy Model lens provides a unique opportunity to examine the multidimensional and dynamic character of linked lives across time and space, we analyze twenty-three years of longitudinal data from the Social Relations Study (SRS). The SRS is a regionally representative Detroit-area sample (N=1,498) with three waves (1992; 2005; 2015) of data from community dwelling people age 13 to 93. We present three illustrative examples of linked lives: 1) the influence of earlier life social network characteristics (size and closeness) on later life health outcomes; 2) the influence of social position (race and education) on relationship quality with spouse/partner and child over time; and 3) the influence of transitioning from working to retirement on network structure (size and geographic proximity). Findings illustrate linked lives through multiple instances of social relationships and as influenced by various contexts. Further, the consequences of linked lives for mental health are consistent across the life course while influence on physical health is variable. The Convoy Model presents key concepts to situate the ways in which linked lives form and function at various levels and across multiple contexts to have far reaching effects on life outcomes.

<title>Networked framing of GMO risks and discussion fragmentation on Chinese social media: a dynamic perspective</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02564-3</url>
<snippet>Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have been highly controversial in China and beyond. The burgeoning of social media has created an online activist field where participants utilize networked framing practices to engage in connective actions related to GMO risks. However, a dynamic perspective on the co-production of GMO risk discourses has yet to be fully explored, and it is still under debate whether such a collective interpretation is fragmented. To address this gap, this study investigates the risk-invoked GMO controversy by longitudinally exploring the structural characteristics and discursive power structures in the networked framing of GMO risks on social media. This study examines 356,227 GMO risk posts from 2010 to 2020 on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. A longitudinal social network analysis and computational text-mining approach are used to construct representation networks among participants based on their joint sponsorship framing practices of GMO risks. The findings suggest that there is a multipolar discussion fragmentation in the networked framing of GMO risks. However, the temporal evidence shows that the risk discussion has become increasingly interconnected and less structurally fragmented over time. In addition, this study highlights the unequal distribution of discursive power among participants; nevertheless, the analysis reveals that this inequality has shown signs of easing over the study period. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the GMO controversy from a risk perspective and sheds light on the dynamics of networked framing practices and discursive power structures on social media.

<snippet>The last decade has shown that sometimes even the largest online social networks (OSNs) collapse. Significant cascading mechanisms have been identified in the pattern of abandoning the OSN iWiW at its peak of popularity and after. We set out to examine the key actors who were the first to leave their networks by contrasting explanations based on the structural position of users in the network. Using heterogeneous choice models, we found that a higher number of connections as well as less clustered ego-networks hindered early abandonment while early adoption was only a secondary factor.

<title>Network dynamics of television use in school classes</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2011.08.002</url>
<snippet>Seventy years ago Paul Lazarsfeld and colleagues found empirical evidence for a significant influence of the social context on media effects by interpersonal communication. Subsequently various theories in mass media science incorporated the social context as an independent or dependent variable. However, there is little empirical research that addresses the dynamics of media use within a social context using network analytic methods. This study considers the social context as both an independent and dependent variable in a dynamic network process in order to disentangle social selection and influence processes. Hence, on one hand it tests whether the intensity of TV use and the use of specific TV genres predict the selection of conversation partners in social groups (social selection process). On the other hand it tests if individuals' social context predicts their TV use (social influence process). Here, social context is defined as the conversation structure as well as the media use of all other persons in the social group. The research design includes a four wave panel survey on interpersonal communication networks and TV use of 707 students (age 13-16) in 29 Swiss school classes. The stochastic actor-based models tested with the program SIENA support the hypothesized selection processes. Conversation partners about TV programs are selected according to the similarity of their TV use. In contrast to this finding, the widely held assumption that individuals are influenced by their social network is not supported. Some inconclusive evidences suggest a possible social influence process on the level of TV intensity but not on the level of specific TV genres. Network-autocorrelation of conversation ties and TV use has therefore primarily be accredited to social selection processes and not social influence. Furthermore, the results show that avid viewers tend to talk more often about TV programs (ego effect), that avid viewers are more likely to be addressed (alter effect), and a general tendency to talk to persons with the same program preference (similarity effect). This challenges the classic idea of a two-step flow of communication in which intensive media users which are well informed would provide information to occasional users which are less conversant with a topic.

<title>Social network structure and composition in former NFL football players</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80091-w</url>
<snippet>Social networks have broad effects on health and quality of life. Biopsychosocial factors may also modify the effects of brain trauma on clinical and pathological outcomes. However, social network characterization is missing in studies of contact sports athletes. Here, we characterized the personal social networks of former National Football League players compared to non-football US males. In 303 former football players and 269 US males, we found that network structure (e.g., network size) did not differ, but network composition (e.g., proportion of family versus friends) did differ. Football players had more men than women, and more friends than family in their networks compared to US males. Black players had more racially diverse networks than White players and US males. These results are unexpected because brain trauma and chronic illnesses typically cause diminished social relationships. We anticipate our study will inform more multi-dimensional study of, and treatment options for, contact sports athletes. For example, the strong allegiances of former athletes may be harnessed in the form of social network interventions after brain trauma. Because preserving health of contact sports athletes is a major goal, the study of social networks is critical to the design of future research and treatment trials.

<title>Misery Does Not Love Company: Network Selection Mechanisms and Depression Homophily</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003122411420813</url>
<snippet>Conventional wisdom holds that friends protect against depression through the social support they provide; however, depression likely has a role in structuring friendship networks. In particular, we investigate friend selection mechanisms responsible for similarity in depression among friends (i.e., homophily). Preference is one explanation, yet several correlates of depression make homophilous selection among depressed individuals unlikely. We propose two alternative mechanisms-avoidance and withdrawal-that can produce depression homophily in the absence of preference. These alternative mechanisms create homophily indirectly by limiting friendship partners available to depressed individuals. We test the preference, avoidance, and withdrawal mechanisms using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and a dynamic network model. Results provide support for the withdrawal mechanism. These findings help explain how depression affects friend selection and have broader implications for understanding selection mechanisms responsible for network patterns such as homophily.

<title>Social Networking for Interpersonal Life: A Competence-Based Approach to the Rich Get Richer Hypothesis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439320909506</url>
<snippet>Online and offline interactions are thought to draw from separate but complementary skill sets. This explains why individuals who are competent interpersonally tend to get more out of social networking. At least part of what they already know about interacting applies online. But whether computer-based competence has some bearing on real-world interactional capability is still open to debate. The present study tested associations between computer-mediated communication (CMC) competence and interpersonal competence over time. Results indicate that CMC competence was related to interpersonal competence and interpersonal contributed back to CMC competence. The forms of competence become mutually reinforcing. Using Facebook contributed to CMC competence as well, but not to interpersonal competence, at least not directly. Facebook use was related to interpersonal competence indirectly, through increasing CMC competence over time. Social networking is associated with feeling more capable of interacting through computers, and online proficiency has some application in the real world. This is good news for a withdrawn society that has become less competent socially. Developing either form of competence should contribute to its counterpart.

<title>Defending against Online Social Network Rumors through Optimal Control Approach</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/6263748</url>
<snippet>Rumors have been widely spread in online social networks and they become a major concern in modern society. This paper is devoted to the design of a cost-effective rumor-containing scheme in online social networks through an optimal control approach. First, a new individual-based rumor spreading model is proposed, and the model considers the influence of the external environment on rumor spreading for the first time. Second, the cost-effectiveness is recommended to balance the loss caused by rumors against the cost of a rumor-containing scheme. On this basis, we reduce the original problem to an optimal control model. Next, we prove that this model is solvable, and we present the optimality system for the model. Finally, we show that the resulting rumor-containing scheme is cost-effective through extensive computer experiments.

<title>Interagency collaboration within the city emergency management network: a case study of Super Ministry Reform in China</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/disa.12495</url>
<snippet>Emergencies continue to become ever more complex; responding to them, therefore, often is beyond the capabilities and capacities of any single public agency. Hence, collaboration among these actors is necessary to prepare for, respond to, and recover from such events. This seldom occurs in an effective or efficient manner, however. Drawing on resource dependence theory and the concept of social capital, this paper reveals that different types of collaborative relationships exist within the collaborative network. Super Ministry Reform of Emergency Management in China serves as a case in point. By evaluating network efficiency and classifying the collaborative relationships of involved government agencies, four types are identified: resource-redundant; resource-complementary; resource-dependent; and resource-isolated. The different influences of collaborative relationships explain why the reform is not that effective, although it has led to the merger of several core departments in the emergency management network. The findings are a reminder to consider network structure and collaboration types when engaging in institutional design.

<title>Climate adaptation pathways and the role of social-ecological networks in small-scale fisheries</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18668-w</url>
<snippet>Climate change is expected to have increasing impacts on marine ecosystems which will threaten the livelihoods and wellbeing of millions of people. Drawing on social-ecological network and sociodemographic data collected via face-to-face interviews with 404 small-scale commercial fishers from 9 Galician communities (Spain), we empirically examine the adaptation pathways that fishers follow when they face hypothetical impacts on their fishery resources and test the role of five social-ecological network structures on fisher's stated intended responses to such scenarios. Our results show that fishers generally intend to follow a 'remain-adapt-transform-exit (the fishery)' pathway when faced with increasing climate impacts. Next, we demonstrate that trust-based bonding ties and ties to informal leaders are associated with a 'business-as-usual' strategy. In contrast, communicative bonding ties are associated with adaptive responses, while communicative bridging ties are associated with transformative and exit strategies. Our findings provide key empirical insight that broaden our understanding of the intricate relationship between social networks and adaptive behaviour relevant to social-ecological systems worldwide.

<title>Applying explainable artificial intelligence methods to models for diagnosing personal traits and cognitive abilities by social network data</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-56080-8</url>
<snippet>This study utilizes advanced artificial intelligence techniques to analyze the social media behavior of 1358 users on VK, the largest Russian online social networking service. The analysis comprises 753,252 posts and reposts, combined with Big Five personality traits test results, as well as assessments of verbal and fluid intelligence. The objective of this research is to understand the manifestation of psychological attributes in social media users' behavior and determine their implications on user-interaction models. We employ the integrated gradients method to identify the most influential feature groups. The partial dependence plot technique aids in understanding how these features function across varying severity degrees of the predicted trait. To evaluate feature stability within the models, we cluster calculated Shapley values. Our findings suggest that the emotional tone (joy, surprise, anger, fear) of posts significantly influences the prediction of three personality traits: Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Openness to Experience. Additionally, user social engagement metrics (such as friend count, subscribers, likes, views, and comments) correlate directly with the predicted level of Logical thinking. We also observe a trend towards provocative and socially reprehensible content among users with high Neuroticism levels. The theme of religion demonstrates a multidirectional relationship with Consciousness and Agreeableness. Further findings, including an analysis of post frequency and key text characteristics, are also discussed, contributing to our understanding of the complex interplay between social media behavior and psychological traits. The study proposes a transition from the analysis of correlations between psychological (cognitive) traits to the analysis of indicators of behavior in a social network that are significant for diagnostic models of the corresponding traits.

<title>Escape from fraught states in a coordination game</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.231314</url>
<snippet>Through a behavioural coordination game played by groups of humans and simulated with agent-based models, we investigated a social network dilemma that we call fraughtness. Seven players, connected to one another in various topologies via a computer network, each had to move a slider to the left or right along a horizontal bar on their screen. The goal was for all the players to move their slider to the same side. Players received feedback indicating the degree to which they and their neighbours agreed about the choice of side. When the topology had a hierarchical branching structure, the groups often got stuck in fraughtness: players on one branch favoured one side, while players on the other branch favoured the other; because all were receiving supportive local feedback, nobody wanted to change. Nevertheless, after being stuck in fraughtness for some time, most groups managed to escape it. Fraughtness is arguably an analog of generally negatively viewed social phenomena like polarization and echo chambers. Our analyses suggest that while fraughtness is problematic, it is closely linked to successful structure formation-it thus may be most effective to focus not on how to banish it, but on how to resolve it.

<title>Identifying Gender-Preferred Communication Styles within Online Cancer Communities: A Retrospective, Longitudinal Analysis</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0049169</url>
<snippet>Background: The goal of this research is to determine if different gender-preferred social styles can be observed within the user interactions at an online cancer community. To achieve this goal, we identify and measure variables that pertain to each gender-specific social style. Methods and Findings: We perform social network and statistical analysis on the communication flow of 8,388 members at six different cancer forums over eight years. Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to measure the difference between the number of intimate (and highly intimate) dyads, relationship length, and number of communications. We determine that two patients are more likely to form an intimate bond on a gender-specific cancer forum (ovarian P = &lt;0.0001, breast P = 0.0089, prostate P = 0.0021). Two female patients are more likely to form a highly intimate bond on a female-specific cancer forum (Ovarian P &lt; 0.0001, Breast P &lt; 0.01). Typically a male patient communicates with more members than a female patient (Ovarian forum P = 0.0406, Breast forum P = 0.0013). A relationship between two patients is longer on the gender-specific cancer forums than a connection between two members not identified as patients (ovarian forum P = 0.00406, breast forum P = 0.00013, prostate forum P = .0.0003). Conclusion: : The high level of interconnectedness among the prostate patients supports the hypothesis that men prefer to socialize in large, interconnected, less-intimate groups. A female patient is more likely to form a highly intimate connection with another female patient; this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that woman prefer fewer, more intimate connections. The relationships of same-gender cancer patients last longer than other relationships; this finding demonstrates homophily within these online communities. Our findings regarding online communication preferences are in agreement with research findings from person-to-person communication preference studies. These findings should be considered when designing online communities as well as designing and evaluating psychosocial and educational interventions for cancer patients.

<title>The Influence of Political Actors in the Digital Public Debate on Twitter About the Negotiations for the Formation of the Government in Spain</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642211003159</url>
<snippet>Social media has introduced new parameters that can potentially transform the digital political conversation. Traditionally, in the age of mass communication, public debate was dominated by politicians and journalists. However, digital platforms, primarily Twitter, have allowed other social actors to join the political discussion, trying to influence it. The objective of this research is to establish what factors enable the authority and digital influence of political actors in the public debate on Twitter. We use a big data sample of 127.3 million tweets from the negotiation process around the formation of the Government in Spain. The applied methodology is based on social network analysis and machine learning. The results show that ideology, political initiative, and political career are configured as factors capable of conditioning the authority and influence of political actors in the political conversation on Twitter.

<title>What types of brokerage bridge the research-practice gap? The case of public school educators</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.05.006</url>
<snippet>The presence of a research-practice gap is recognized across multiple fields including education, psychology, and public health. In this paper, we examine which of five structural types of brokerage are most and least effective in bridging this research-practice gap in the context of education. Using a small world survey design, we tracked how a statewide random sample of 247 K-12 principals and superintendents in Michigan seek information about social skills programs from brokering individuals and organizations. We find that some triadic brokerage structures are more effective than others in closing the communication gap between practitioners and researchers. Specifically, educators relying on itinerant brokerage, which circulates information between members of the same community, were five times less likely to obtain information from a researcher. In contrast, educators relying on representative or liaison brokerage, which facilitate information transfer between members of different communities, were more than twice as likely to obtain information from a researcher. We conclude by discussing implications for the development of interventions designed to facilitate information sharing between practitioners and researchers.

<title>A model and simulation of the emotional contagion of netizens in the process of rumor refutation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-50770-4</url>
<snippet>The emotional contagion of netizens is an important factor that accelerates the spread of rumors, and it is also key to the effectiveness of rumor refutation. Based on the existing emotional model, we improved the method for calculating the emotional value and the transformation rules to simulate how the infection transforms individual emotion to group emotion during rumor refutation. The results show that the cycle and trend of netizen emotional change vary by period, but the final distribution structure presents a relatively stable state. The factors that affect the emotional changes of netizens are mainly objective and subjective aspects, both of which can promote the evolution of emotional contagion. The objective aspect depends on the speed and credibility of the rumor, and the subjective aspect depends on the degree of intimacy between netizens. After rumor refutation, emotions generally change from negative emotions to positive or immune emotions.

<title>The anatomy of a population-scale social network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-36324-9</url>
<snippet>Large-scale human social network structure is typically inferred from digital trace samples of online social media platforms or mobile communication data. Instead, here we investigate the social network structure of a complete population, where people are connected by high-quality links sourced from administrative registers of family, household, work, school, and next-door neighbors. We examine this multilayer social opportunity structure through three common concepts in network analysis: degree, closure, and distance. Findings present how particular network layers contribute to presumably universal scale-free and small-world properties of networks. Furthermore, we suggest a novel measure of excess closure and apply this in a life-course perspective to show how the social opportunity structure of individuals varies along age, socio-economic status, and education level.

<title>SONIC: SOcial Network analysis with Influencers and Communities</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.02.008</url>
<snippet>The integration of social media characteristics into an econometric framework requires modeling a high dimensional dynamic network with dimensions of parameter typically much larger than the number of observations. To cope with this problem, we introduce SONIC, a new high-dimensional network model that assumes that (1) only few influencers drive the network dynamics; (2) the community structure of the network is characterized by homogeneity of response to specific influencers, implying their underlying similarity. An estimation procedure is proposed based on a greedy algorithm and LASSO regularization. Through theoretical study and simulations, we show that the matrix parameter can be estimated even when sample size is smaller than the size of the network. Using a novel dataset retrieved from one of leading social media platforms - StockTwits and quantifying their opinions via natural language processing, we model the opinions network dynamics among a select group of users and further detect the latent communities. With a sparsity regularization, we can identify important nodes in the network.

<title>Examination of public perceptions of microbes and microbiomes in the United States reveals insights for science communication</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312427</url>
<snippet>Within a changing research and media landscape, misconceptions and misinformation about microorganisms and microbiomes can arise, necessitating improvements in science communication practices through insights in public perceptions of the microbial world. Yet, little is known about public perceptions of microorganisms and microbiomes, making it difficult to develop tailored messaging. Here we perform an inductive thematic analysis with interviews and surveys from thirty adults across the United States to identify key factors to enhance microbial science communication efforts. Together, our results underscore the importance of 1) recognizing the existing and desired future knowledge of an audience, 2) aligning with broader socio-scientific issues that resonate with people in relevant channels using social networks, 3) fostering collaboration between microbiologists, social scientists, and communicators to improve messaging, and 4) appealing to people's values and emotions to establish meaningful connections. This study concludes that non-microbial interests, such as an interest in health and wellness, may lead to acquisition of microbial knowledge and that people want scientists to share microbial messages preferably on platforms like social media. Additionally, we identified confusion about microbial terms and a desire to understand human-centric benefits of microorganisms and microbiomes. We suggest that microbiologists partner with science communicators to develop microbial messaging, capitalizing on connections to non-microbial interests and appealing to people's microbial worldview.
